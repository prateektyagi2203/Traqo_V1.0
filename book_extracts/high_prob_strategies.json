      "text": "Foreword\nI\nmet Robert Miner not long after the market crash of October 1987. I reluctantly went\nto a trading conference in downtown Chicago where he was one of many speakers.\nI was reluctant to attend the conference because I had recently lost my cushy job at\nthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange where I had been managing a ﬂoor trading operation,\nworking with institutional clients in the ﬁnancial futures markets. Fortunately, I decided\nto attend the conference, which ended up opening the door to whole new career in the\ntrading industry.\nI had heard about Fibonacci retracements before, but only as they were applied to\nthe price axis of the market. I remember the exact area of the room where I sat when\nBob gave his presentation and illustrated, among other things, a very simple example of\nFibonacci applied to the time axis of the market. I swear it was just like the proverbial\nlight bulb went on above my head, and part of me knew that this was the key to my\nfuture. It was an “aha” moment.\nI was so fascinated by Bob’s presentation, I made my way over to his booth in the\nexpo hall and told him how much I enjoyed his presentation. This led to shooting a couple\nof games of pool over cocktails, and that was the beginning of our friendship that has\nlasted over the years.\nWhen I started studying Bob’s work, I was so fascinated that I would work on my\npaper charts with a pencil, calculator, and proportional divider every chance I got. I did\nnot own a computer at the time. Through this almost daily ritual with my hand updated\npaper charts, I would prove to myself how powerful were the strategies he taught. I\nstarted sharing some of my results with some friends and clients. It worked so well, some\nof them started offering to pay me for my analysis. I studied everything Bob had to teach\nover the years and perfected my trade strategies. All this eventually led to opening my\nown market analysis and trade recommendation business, Synchronicity Market Timing.\nWithout Bob Miner, I would not be enjoying the very successful career I have today.\nMost of what I’ve learned about technical analysis and trade strategies, I learned from\nBob. I am forever grateful for what he has taught me over the years as I can truly say I\nlove my work, and they even pay me for doing it!\nThanks Bob!!\nCarolyn Boroden\naka FibonacciQueen, www.ﬁbonacciqueen.com\nix\n",

      "text": "Preface\nH\nigh Probability Trading Strategies is one of the few trading books from which\nyou can learn a complete trade management plan from entry to exit.\nIf you are a new trader or one who has not yet found consistent success in the\nbusiness of trading futures, stocks, or forex, you will learn speciﬁc trade strategies, from\nhow to identify high probability trade conditions, to the speciﬁc entry and stop price,\nthrough exit strategies that are designed to maximize the gain from any trend. If you\nare an experienced and successful trader, I know that you will recognize several key\nstrategies to incorporate into your existing trade plan that should immediately increase\nyour success.\nI’ve been teaching these strategies for over 20 years to traders around the world. I’ve\nreﬁned and simpliﬁed the strategies over the years to get to the core of the most impor-\ntant information a trader needs to make a trading decision and manage the trade. The\ncombination of book and CD will provide more information in a better learning environ-\nment than I can offer in an expensive weekend workshop.\nYou will learn my unique approach to the four main factors of technical analysis, in-\ncluding Multiple Time Frame Momentum setups and the one main guideline to recognize\nthe pattern structure of trends and corrections. Plus you will learn my Dynamic Price\nand Time Strategies to identify in advance the probable price and time targets for trends\nand corrections. You will learn two powerful and logical objective entry techniques and\nhow to manage a trade for short- and intermediate-term gains through the trade exit in\nany market and any time frame. I’ve also devoted an entire chapter called “Real Traders,\nReal Time” (Chapter 8) with trade examples submitted by my past students, who show\nhow they apply every day the strategies you learn in this book to markets from around\nthe world.\nThe video CD takes the learning experience to a much higher level than any book\nis able to do on its own. In the video CD, you will see more examples of how to apply\nthe High Probability Trading Strategies for many markets and time frames in bar-by-\nbar and step-by-step recordings. Be sure to read the book ﬁrst, cover to cover, before\nwatching the video CD. The CD material assumes you have learned the techniques and\nstrategies taught in the book.\nI’m sure High Probability Trading Strategies and the accompanying video CD will\nbecome one of your most important trading reference materials. It may even become the\ncomplete trading plan you have been looking for to manage trades from entry to exit for\nany market and any time frame.\nxi\n",

Unlike most trading books, it will teach you a complete trading\nplan from entry to exit. Not a few well-chosen examples of isolated trade setups\nand strategies, but exactly how to recognize optimal trade conditions, objective\nentry strategies with the exact entry and exit price, and how to manage the trade with\nstop-loss adjustments to the trade exit.\nThe majority of trading books focus on a few techniques and show a plethora of\ncarefully chosen examples to support whatever is being taught. Some of the phrases\noften used are “You could have bought around here or taken proﬁt around here”;\n“depending on whether you are a conservative or aggressive trader, you could do . . . (this\nor that)”; “markets usually ﬂuctuate around the volatility band, which is a good place to\nbuy or sell”; and lots more nonspeciﬁc statements.\nBrokers don’t take orders “around this or that price level.” They only take speciﬁc\nprice orders. There is no such thing as a conservative or aggressive trader. There are\nonly traders who either follow a trading plan or don’t. To maybe do this or that “around”\na volatility band or any other indicator or chart position is not a trade strategy. A trade\nstrategy is a speciﬁc action to take, including the speciﬁc buy and sell price. In other\nwords, worthwhile instruction will teach you exactly what to do and how and when\nto do it.\nWhile many trading books do teach some useful speciﬁc trading techniques or at\nleast provide some ideas to explore, it is very unusual for a book or any other type of\ntrading course to teach exactly what to do, from how to recognize a trading opportunity,\nto the exact entry and stop price, and how to manage the trade until it is closed out.\nThat is what this book does. It will teach you a high probability trade plan with speciﬁc\nstrategies from entry to exit. Most important, it will teach you how to think about the\nfour key factors of momentum, pattern, price, and time; how to recognize what is useful\nand relevant market information that can be used to make a speciﬁc trade decision; and\nthen how to execute the trade decisions from entry to exit.\n3\n",

      "text": "4\nHIGH PROBABILITY TRADING STRATEGIES FOR ANY MARKET AND ANY TIME FRAME\nA book is a static medium. It takes a lot of screen captures of charts to illustrate a\ntrade campaign from entry to exit, no matter what market or time frame is used. Thus,\nthis book has a lot of charts. I’ve taken care that the information on each chart should be\nquickly and easily understood. Most charts include text comments pointing out the most\nrelevant information based on what I teach you throughout the book.\nWhen John Wiley & Sons approached me regarding this book, I insisted I would do it\nonly if it included an instructional CD where I could record additional examples, bar by\nbar, using trading software training mode. They agreed, and the addition of the CD trade\nexamples makes this package a complete learning experience.\nDon’t rush to watch the CD. The book provides all the background for what is shown\nin the CD. In the CD recordings, I assume you have read the book, cover to cover. I\nassume you are familiar with all the terminology, trade strategies, and book examples.\nYou will be lost watching the CD if you haven’t ﬁrst read the book. The CD is not a\nreview or regurgitation of the material in the book. Rather, it provides the medium to be\nable to show more examples but in a bar-by-bar recording, so you can better see how the\nstrategies taught in the book are put into practice day by day and bar by bar for many\ndifferent markets and many different time frames.\nI believe this book and CD combination provides a better learning experience than\neven most live workshops, because you can study all the material at your own pace and\nreplay the recorded CD examples over and over.\nANY MARKET, ANY TIME FRAME\nThe trade strategies you will learn in this book may be used for any actively traded mar-\nket and any time frame. Stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), futures, and Forex ex-\namples are used. The same market structure is made day in and day out in all of these\nmarkets and in all time frames, from monthly to intraday data. If an example is not a\nmarket or time frame you typically trade, ignore the symbol and focus on what is to be\nlearned. The strategy taught will apply to all markets and time frames.\nCONDITIONS WITH A HIGH PROBABILITY\nOUTCOME\nThe objective of any trade strategy is to identify conditions with a high probability out-\ncome and acceptable capital exposure. You will learn the four main factors of any market\nposition and how to identify if each is in a position for a high probability outcome. When\na market is set up for change from four different perspectives, the trader has an enor-\nmous edge, much more so than if only one or two of the factors are in the same position.\nTo win in the business of trading, just as in any other business, you must have an edge.\nThe edge you learn in this book is to recognize when a market is in a position to complete\n",

Buying or selling too early or too\nlate can result in, at worst, unacceptable losses or, at best, not maximizing the return\nfrom a position. The trader must clearly understand the relevant information about the\nmarket position to recognize the optimal conditions to buy or sell.\nMarkets can seem very complex. The plethora of relatively inexpensive trading soft-\nware available with hundreds of studies and indicators can overwhelm a trader with\noften conﬂicting information, making it difﬁcult to focus on the relevant information\nneeded to make a conﬁdent trade decision.\nThe high probability approach taught in this book recognizes four market perspec-\ntives: multiple time frame momentum, simple pattern recognition, price reversal targets,\nand time reversal targets. The information from any one of these four perspectives could\nbe overwhelming. But in this book, you will learn how to focus on just those few bits of\nrelevant information from each perspective that should quickly identify both the market\nposition and whether a market is in a high probability position for a trade.\nI rarely do live workshops, but when I do I present a special exercise at the end of\nthe session. I tell the students that I can apply what I have taught them to any symbol,\nincluding stocks, ETFs, futures, or Forex, and it will take three minutes or less to pro-\ncess all of the information needed to identify whether the symbol is in a high probability\nposition for a trade setup or what that particular market must do to become a high prob-\nability trade setup. I have the students write any symbol on a piece of note paper. We\ncollect them in a hat and I draw them out one by one. In less than three minutes, I apply\neverything I have taught them and arrive at a conclusion what is the probable market\nposition of the symbol and the speciﬁc trade strategies. You, too, will be able to do this\nafter you have studied this book and viewed the CD examples.\nIf a trader focuses on just the limited, relevant information needed to make a high\nprobability trade decision, the chance of success is great.\nLEADING AND LAGGING INDICATORS\nThe vast majority of traders use only lagging indicators for their trade strategies. Every\nindicator or oscillator in every trading platform and charting program is a lagging indi-\ncator. A lagging indicator will show you how the current market position relates to past\ndata for the lookback period, but has little predictive capabilities. A momentum indi-\ncator can be useful to help identify trend direction and trade execution if used with the\nunique multiple time frame momentum strategy you will learn in this book. But the mo-\nmentum strategy is still only useful when it is part of a trading plan that includes leading\nindicators.\n",

      "text": "6\nHIGH PROBABILITY TRADING STRATEGIES FOR ANY MARKET AND ANY TIME FRAME\nA leading indicator will prepare you in advance for probable trade conditions. Us-\ning my unique approach to dynamic time and price strategies, developed over the past\n20 years, you will learn how to identify in advance the probable price and time target\nzones not just for support and resistance, but, more importantly, for trend reversal. We\ncall these price and time strategies leading indicators because they identify in advance\nconditions with a high probability outcome. If a market fulﬁlls those conditions, a trade\nsetup is made. I know they will become a very important part of your trading plan when\nyou learn the power of being prepared in advance for speciﬁc price and time targets for\ntrend reversal.\nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS BOOK AND\nVIDEO CD\nIn this book, you will ﬁrst learn the four dimensions of market position: multiple time\nframe momentum, pattern, price, and time. Each factor provides an important piece of\ninformation you will use to make a trading decision. A trading plan that does not include\nthese four market dimensions is missing a big piece of the market puzzle and is much\nless effective than one that includes all four dimensions.\nMost readers are familiar with momentum studies, also called indicators or oscilla-\ntors. A momentum indicator by itself is not of much practical use to the trader. All mo-\nmentum studies are lagging indicators. They are great for showing you the current market\nposition relative to the past, but are not of much help in pointing to the probable trend\nposition in the future—unless you use them in the unique way you will learn in Chapter\n2. Chapter 2 presents a momentum strategy used by few traders that will teach you how\nto use the lagging momentum indicators as a powerful technique as a ﬁlter for trade di-\nrection and execution setups. This multiple time frame momentum strategy will become\nthe most useful and practical momentum application you can add to your trading plan.\nElliott wave pattern analysis has been so overcomplicated and misinterpreted over\nthe years that many traders avoid it like the plague. I don’t blame them. In Chapter 3,\nyou will learn the simple guidelines based on Elliott wave structures to identify three fre-\nquent patterns for all markets and all time frames. One simple guideline will instantly re-\nveal if a market should be in a trend or countertrend. This simple guideline itself should\nmake a big difference in your trading results. It is critical for the trader to recognize\nwhether the current market condition is part of a correction or trend, and, more impor-\ntant, if the correction or trend is in a position to be complete. This information can be\na very important part of your trading plan and help prepare you for market reversals of\nany time frame. After you have learned the pattern guidelines in Chapter 3, you will be\nable to quickly recognize the probable structure position of any market and any time\nframe.\nMost traders are familiar with Fibonacci (Fib) price retracements. Like a single time\nframe momentum study, they are not of much practical use by themselves to make a\ntrade decision. Chapter 4 teaches you how to identify in advance which retracement\n",

It also teaches you how to\nproject the probable trend targets in advance to be prepared for the price level at which\na trend should be complete. You will also learn some new ratios that are not a part of the\nFib ratio series that are a key to correction and trend price targets. Once you learn my\nDynamic Price Strategies in Chapter 4, you should be prepared not just for temporary\nsupport and resistance levels, but for the speciﬁc price levels for trend and countertrend\nreversals.\nMarket timing in its true sense—identifying speciﬁc time target zones for trend\nchange in any time frame—is rarely used by most traders. W. D. Gann taught many years\nago, “When time is up, change is inevitable.” Chapter 5 teaches you my unique Dynamic\nTime Strategies I’ve developed over the past 20 years, which will allow you to project\nthe probable minimum and maximum time targets for trend reversal. You will also learn\nhow to project time bands in any time frame to target a relatively narrow time range with\na high probability for trend change. Practical market timing should be an important part\nof every trader’s plan.\nAfter you have learned these four key factors of market position that will prepare you\nto recognize optimal trade conditions, Chapter 6 teaches you two completely objective\nentry strategies and how to quickly determine the maximum position size for any trade.\nThe strategies you learn in Chapter 6 will completely eliminate any guesswork on what\nprice you should enter a market and what should be the stop-loss price. Most important,\nyou will learn what all successful traders know: The proper position size for any trade\nsetup on any time frame is one of the most important keys to long-term success for the\nbusiness of trading.\nEarlier I promised that you would learn how to manage a trade from entry to exit.\nChapter 7 is the heart of this book, as far as I’m concerned. This is where you learn\nto apply all of the practical strategies, from recognizing high probability trade setups,\nto the speciﬁc entry strategy, stop-loss adjustment, and exit strategy. In other words,\nChapter 7 teaches you how to manage a trade from entry to exit.

The MTF\nMomentum Strategy is a key factor to the trade plan that identiﬁes\nhigh probability trade setups with minimal capital exposure.\nJ\nust about every trading book or course will emphasize that you always want to\n“trade with the trend.” It’s great advice. If you are always trading with the trend,\nyou should mount up some very impressive gains.\nTwo big questions are usually not clearly answered: “How do you objectively identify\ntrend direction?” and “Is the trend in the early or late stages?”\nIn almost every trading book and course I’ve seen over the past 20 or more years,\nthe trading educators show many after-the-fact examples of how their trend indicator\nidentiﬁed the trend direction long after the trend was established. It is easy to show\na trend on any chart long after the trend is established. But how do we identify trend\ndirection in the early stages? How do we identify when an established trend is in the\nlater stages and in a position to make a trend reversal? Without some approach to help\nidentify where within the trend the market likely is, typical trend analysis will usually be\ntoo early or too late to be useful over time.\nIt is easy to ﬁll a book with after-the-fact examples of trends. Trendlines, moving av-\nerages, channels, momentum indicators, and many other techniques can show the trend\non historic data. Unfortunately, none of these techniques can reliably alert you to the\nbeginning stages of a new trend or whether a trend is in its ﬁnal stages. They can only\nidentify an established trend, usually long after the trend is established and the optimum\nentry is long over.\nI know, we could say that a trendline break indicates a trend is complete and a rever-\nsal has been made. For every trendline break that follows a trend reversal, I can show you\na trendline break fake-out that is followed by a continuation of the prior trend. Moving\naverage crossovers are notorious for false trend reversal signals.\n9\n",

This is a bold\nstatement, but I believe it is true. It’s time to stop the madness and and deal with the\nreality of trend position. I defy any trading educator to provide evidence that his so-\ncalled trend indicator consistently provides an accurate signal of trend position and trend\nreversal in a timely manner that a trader can take advantage of.\nHow can I make this statement? Let’s defy the crowd and think for ourselves in a\nlogical manner. What does a trendline, channel lines, moving average, or other indicator\nrepresent? Every moving average, channel, or indicator is based on historic price data.\nIt can only represent what has happened or what is the current market position relative\nto the lookback period. It has little predictive value in and of itself. It will always be\na lagging indicator of the trend position, never a leading indicator of what is likely to\nhappen in the future.\nWhy are some of these techniques promoted over and over again as “trend indica-\ntors” with value for making practical trade decisions? Because it is easy to ﬁnd lots of\nchart examples that seem to illustrate how valuable are each of the author’s price trend\nindicators. However, let me make you this promise and this challenge. Name a trend in-\ndicator and for any market or any time frame that you are given an example of how it\ndeﬁnes the trend, I will show you two examples where it quickly failed.\nEvery one of these techniques, whether a trendline, volatility channel, moving aver-\nage crossover, or momentum indicator, can be a useful part of a comprehensive trading\nplan, but none of them alone will be of much use in and of itself to identify the probable\ntrend direction for a future period. Over and over again, you will ﬁnd that price rever-\nsals do not coincide with the trend indicator reversals. As I mentioned earlier, for every\nafter-the-fact, well-chosen example given, I will quickly ﬁnd at least two where the trend\nindicator did not work to identify a trend reversal in a timely manner.\nHowever, there is a way to use some of these indicators to identify high probability\ntrade setups.\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to use just about any momentum indicator as a\ntrend indicator for trade direction in a unique but very logical way that you have probably\nnot been taught before. We are not concerned with identifying the exact price-swing\nhigh or low of a trend. Rather, we are concerned with identifying trades in the direction\nof the trend, including near the early stages of the trend and avoiding the later stages.\nThe Multiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy that you are about to learn is the most\npowerful strategy to ﬁlter any market for trade direction and trade execution setups.\nNot only do I believe the Multiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy is the best use of\nan indicator for trading strategies, I believe it is the only practical indicator strategy for\nreal-world trading.\nThe Multiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy is not a stand-alone trade system (al-\nthough it is probably much better than most “systems” that sell for thousands of dollars),\nbut when it is included as part of a trade plan with the time, price, and pattern strategies\nyou will also learn in this book, you will have a powerful trade plan that will not only\nidentify high probability trade setups with minimal capital exposure, but warn you when\na trend is near the end and a major trend reversal is likely.\n",

      "text": "Multiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy\n11\nI use the term capital exposure to describe what many trade educators call risk.\nRisk is the probability of an event happening. Capital exposure is the amount of money\n(capital) that may be lost if a market moves against you. I have much more to say about\ncapital exposure later in the book.\nLet’s begin with the concepts of trend and momentum before we even look at a chart\nor the dual time frame momentum strategy rules.\nWHAT IS MOMENTUM?\nIn the world of trading, there are hundreds of momentum indicators (also called oscil-\nlators). Most of these indicators use the same information, the open-high-low-close of\na price bar, and represent about the same thing, the rate-of-change of price. There is\nnothing mysterious, magical, or unique about this. All price indicators look back over a\ngiven period, called the lookback period, crunch the price data, and compare the recent\nprice position with the price position of the lookback period. Different indicators manip-\nulate and display the output differently, but all price-based indicators represent about\nthe same thing: the rate-of-change or how fast the price trend is moving. The indicator\nreversals represent the change in momentum—the increase or decrease in the rate-of-\nchange of the price trend. That is why you can use almost any price based indicator for\nthe Multiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy you will learn in this chapter.\nThe ﬁrst and most basic concept is this: Momentum indicators do not represent\nprice trends. Momentum indicators represent momentum trends. This should be\nobvious, but I can’t tell you how many new traders over the years expect a price reversal\nevery time a momentum indicator reverses. It just doesn’t work this way, because the\nindicator does not represent the price trend. If it did, this book would be about three\npages long because all we would have to do is reverse our trade position each time a\nmomentum indicator makes a reversal, and we would compound money faster than\nrabbits on Viagra can reproduce.\nUnfortunately, it is not that easy. Price and momentum do not always trend together.\nFor example, a momentum indicator may make a bearish reversal and decline while the\nprice trend continues to advance. How can it do this? The rate-of-change of the price\ntrend is decreasing even though price continues to advance. The bullish trend is just\nslowing down, so the momentum indicator is bearish even though the price trend con-\ntinues to be bullish. The outcome: The price trend and momentum trend run opposite of\neach other.\nLet me repeat this basic and very important concept about momentum indicators:\nMomentum indicators represent momentum trends, not price trends. Never expect\nprice to reverse when the indicator makes a reversal. Often both price and momentum\nreverse together, but sometimes they will diverge because the price trend is only slowing\ndown, forcing the indicator to reverse.\nThis point is important to clearly understand, and the vast majority of traders just\ndon’t get it. So let me repeat it one more time: Momentum indicators represent momen-\ntum trends, not price trends. Price and momentum may not trend in the same direction.\nNot every momentum reversal will coincide with a price reversal.\n",

You will also learn how, by incorporating dual time frame momentum trends in a\ncomprehensive trading plan that also includes the time, price, and pattern position of a\nmarket, you can identify whether the market is at or very near a price trend reversal.\nMULTIPLE TIME FRAME MOMENTUM STRATEGIES\nIn over 20 years of trading and educating traders beginning in the mid-1980s, Multiple\nTime Frame Momentum Strategies have become the most powerful trade direction and\nexecution approach I’ve added to my trading plan and taught my students.\nFor at least the ﬁrst 10 years I traded, I never used an indicator. I was basically a pure\nchartist using time, price and pattern position to identify trade setups and targets. My\nstrategy was based on Gann, Elliott, and Fibonacci. In 1989, I released what I believe was\nthe ﬁrst futures trading home study course, called the W.D. Gann Home Study Trading\nCourse, based on Gann, Elliott, and Fibonacci trade strategies. This course is no longer\navailable.\nIt wasn’t until the late 1980s that I even had a computer with a charting program. I\nstudied a lot about indicators and discovered I could always ﬁnd an indicator or make a\nchange in a lookback period or other setting for the indicator to conﬁrm whatever price\ntrend bias I had. There was never an indicator on my charts, simply because everything I\nread and tested on indicator strategies didn’t seem to work out, and I just could not ﬁnd\na logical and practical application for indicators.\nAround the mid-1990s, at the prompting of one of my students, I began to look at how\na momentum indicator could help conﬁrm the pattern and price position. It took a couple\nof years to work out practical strategies for a momentum indicator to be a part of a real-\nworld trading plan. Then, several years ago, I started working with momentum strategies\nusing multiple time frames and was blown away with how valuable they could be as\npart of the trading plan, to identify trade direction and trade execution and to conﬁrm a\npotential price reversal at price or time targets. Like everything I teach in this book, these\nstrategies can be used for any time frame and any market, from day to position trading.\nTHE BASIC DUAL TIME FRAME\nMOMENTUM STRATEGY\nI ﬁrst teach the concept and application of a momentum strategy using two time frames.\nLater I give examples of how to use more than two time frames, but two are all you need.\nYou will learn how to integrate this strategy into your trade plan.\n",

It doesn’t matter what time frames you use. If you are\na position trader looking for trades that last from several weeks to months, you will use\nweekly and daily momentum trends. If you are a swing trader looking for trades that last\na few days, you will use daily and hourly data. Day traders will probably use 60-minute\nand 15-minute data or even smaller time frames.\nLet’s break down the Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy into its parts to identify\ntrade direction and trade execution setups.\nLarger Time Frame Momentum Trend Identiﬁes\nTrade Direction\nWe know the momentum trend will not always be in the direction of the price trend.\nBut a good indicator with the right lookback period will usually trend in the direction of\nprice and reverse within a very few bars of the price reversal. When price and momentum\ndiverge, as in the case of a bullish price trend and bearish momentum trend, the larger\ntime frame bearish momentum will keep us out of trades when the price trend is slowing\ndown. The speciﬁc trade strategies you will learn in a later chapter will usually keep you\nout of a trade when the momentum trend is diverging with the price trend, which, at the\nleast, will limit losses on losing trades. And remember, you will have losses, so a trade\nstrategy that minimizes losses on losing trades is essential for trading success.\nDual Time Frame (DTF) Momentum Rule 1: Only trade in the direction of the\nlarger time frame momentum trend unless the momentum position is overbought\nor oversold.\nI’ll deﬁne the overbought and oversold exceptions soon.\nThe larger time frame momentum position identiﬁes the trade direction. It does not\nsignal that a trade should be executed; it only signals the direction of a possible trade,\nlong or short. The smaller time frame momentum reversals are the speciﬁc signal that\nmust be made before the trade is even considered. The smaller time frame momentum\nreversal does not execute the trade, but completes the conditions that must be in place\nbefore a trade execution may be considered.\n",

      "text": "14\nHIGH PROBABILITY TRADING STRATEGIES FOR ANY MARKET AND ANY TIME FRAME\nExecute the Trade Following Smaller Time Frame\nMomentum Reversals\nThe key to momentum strategies is to use at least two time frames—a larger time frame\nto identify trade direction, and a smaller time frame for trade execution setups. We only\nwant to take a trade if at least two time frames of momentum are moving in the same\ndirection. That ups the odds big-time for the trade to be successful. This is such a simple\nand logical strategy that it should be a part of everyone’s trade plan.\nIf a trader only considers the momentum position of one time frame, he is at a great\ndisadvantage. Momentum may trend consistently without making any reversals, but dur-\ning that momentum trend, price will usually make corrections, sometimes sizable ones,\nwithout the momentum making a reversal. Or the speed of the price trend will ebb and\nﬂow without causing a momentum reversal. Wouldn’t it be best to be able to identify dur-\ning the price trend when either a minor correction is likely to be complete or the speed\nof the trend might increase? That is what is accomplished by using the Dual Time Frame\nMomentum Strategy.\nDTF Momentum Rule 2: A trade execution may be made following a smaller time\nframe momentum reversal in the direction of the larger time frame momentum\ntrend.\nThe initial conditions for trade entry are met when the smaller time frame momen-\ntum makes a reversal in the direction of the larger time frame momentum trend. That\ngives us the best shot for the price trend making the biggest moves with minimal capital\nexposure.\nMOMENTUM REVERSALS\nA momentum reversal is when the momentum indicator reverses from bullish to bearish\nor from bearish to bullish. A momentum indicator that has two lines, like a stochastic or\na relative strength index, makes a momentum reversal when the fast line crosses above\nor below the slow line. The fast line in most two-line indicators is usually the raw data;\nthe slow line is usually a moving average of the fast line. When the fast line crosses the\nslow line the momentum trend is likely reversing. A momentum crossover is similar to\na moving average crossover except the momentum crossover is of the indicator values\nand not the price data itself. A momentum reversal for some indicators may be signaled\nby the momentum lines crossing above or below the oversold (OS) or overbought (OB)\nzones, if the indicator is the type with OS and OB zones.\nOther indicators will have other conditions that reﬂect a reversal in momentum.\nWith a moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator, when the bars be-\ncome taller or shorter or cross the signal line, the momentum speed is changing. Each\nindicator will have different conditions that signal a momentum reversal but they all rep-\nresent about the same thing: The price trend is either reversing, slowing, or speeding up.\nLater we’ll see chart examples that show momentum reversals, but for now, you must\n",

Un-\nderstanding the concepts ﬁrst is the key to developing a speciﬁc trade strategy for any\nmarket and any time frame, under any market condition.\nA smaller time frame momentum reversal into the direction of the larger time frame\nmomentum is the Dual Time Frame Momentum setup for a trade. It is a precondition\nthat must be met before a trade is even considered. A Dual Time Frame Momentum\nStrategy will be the best ﬁlter you have to identify optimum trades.

The three indicators are a stochastic (Stoch), relative strength index (RSI), and\nDT Oscillator (DTosc), which is a combination of RSI and Stoch. All four studies have an\neight-period lookback.\nThe momentum trends are about the same in all three indicators. While it is a little\ndifﬁcult to see this in the black-and-white screen shots, the momentum reversals for\neach indicator where the fast line crosses the slow line are all within a bar or two of each\nother.\nWhat’s the point of this comparison? Most price-based indicators represent about\nthe same thing, that momentum cycles act and react about the same time. The settings\nfor any indicator, including the lookback period can be tweaked for different markets\nand different time frames for the most reliable signals. But, as you can see from Figure\n2.1, even without tweaking the settings for each indicator they each still represented the\nmomentum cycles about equally well. Later in this chapter you will learn how to choose\nthe best settings for any indicator for any market and time frame.\nFigure 2.2 is another screen shot with just two indicators, Stoch and DTosc, with less\ndata so you can see the momentum cycles more clearly. I’ve drawn thick vertical lines in\nthe indicator window at each bullish and bearish momentum reversal where the fast line\ncrosses the slow line.\nThe momentum reversals in both indicators were made plus or minus one bar of\neach other. Either the Stoch or DTosc would be equally helpful to identify momentum\nreversals for this data. Don’t let anyone sell you on some magical, mystical indicator for\nmomentum trading!

The vertical arrows show the four\nlower time frame 15m momentum bullish reversals during the time when the higher time\nframe 60m momentum was bullish.

We haven’t talked about\nentry strategies yet so we will pass on this question for now. Remember, the smaller time\nframe momentum reversal in the direction of the larger time frame momentum is only the\ncondition that must be met to consider a trade; it is not a trade execution strategy.\nThe second and third 15m momentum bullish reversals were followed by strong ad-\nvances. The fourth reversal was followed by several sideways to down bars before the\nhigher time frame 60m momentum made a bearish reversal where the arrowed line along\nthe bars ends. Regardless of the speciﬁc trade execution strategy used, based only on\nthe Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy setups there were two set ups for clear-cut\nwinners, and two no-trades or small losses.\nThe next example is bond weekly and daily data, which may be used to position-\ntrade bond futures or a bond exchange-traded fund (ETF). Figure 2.8 shows the higher\ntime frame bond weekly data. I’ve labeled the ﬁve weekly momentum trends for this\n18-month period. I chose this period because it includes a fairly prolonged cycle of price-\nmomentum divergence when the weekly momentum was bearish while bond prices con-\ntinued sideways to up.\nThe ﬁve momentum trends during this period are labeled 1 through 5 in the indicator\nwindow below the bar chart. Period 1 is a bullish momentum trend that began in May\nand ended in August. For the next several months, the momentum trend was bearish\n(period 2), although bonds eventually went higher but ended the period with little net\nadvance. How can there be a price bull trend with a momentum bear trend? You know\nthe answer to this. The rate of advance slowed down compared to what it had been.\nThe bond market became choppy with short swings up and down. This decreased rate-\nof-change and choppy market would force any price momentum indicator to become\nbearish.\nIt would be nice if we knew in advance when a market was going to go into a trad-\ning range or slow down a trend, but we can never know this in advance. We are always\ntrading on the right-hand side of the chart after the last bar, which is the unknown side\nof the chart. We can only use the information available as of the last price bar to make\na decision. I’ve actually read articles and chapters in books about “how to trade a trad-\ning range.” You can never know in advance if a market is going to begin a trading\nrange—never. If any trading instructor tries to teach you special strategies for trading\nranges, run, don’t walk. The strategies will all have worked great after the fact. But you\nwill never know in advance when to use the so-called trading range strategies because\nyou can never know in advance if a market is going to begin a trading range.\nDuring periods 3, 4, and 5, the weekly momentum and price trended together. Let’s\ntake a look at the smaller time frame daily momentum trends and reversals for each of\nthe ﬁve weekly momentum trends shown on this weekly chart.\nThe ﬁrst daily bond chart (Figure 2.9) is for weekly period 1, when the weekly mo-\nmentum was bullish from May through August. Bonds made two daily momentum bullish\nreversals below the overbought zone during this period. The overbought line is the 75%\nhorizontal line near the top of the indicator window.

The weekly momen-\ntum turned bullish the week ending May 21. The ﬁrst daily momentum bullish reversal on\nJune 10 was made almost three weeks after the weekly momentum bullish reversal.

Regardless of the time frame you\ntrade, a trade is not entered until a bar high or low is taken out following the smaller time\nframe momentum reversal.\nDaily bearish reversal 2 was made on the swing high bar followed by a sharp decline.\nNice setup. Daily momentum reversals numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 were all made within a bar\nor two of a swing high and followed by very tradable multiday declines.\nNow I don’t want you to think at this point that every Dual Time Frame Momentum\nStrategy setup will result in a proﬁtable trade. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nA complete trading plan depends on more factors, including trade entry, stop-loss, exit\nstrategy, multiple units, acceptable capital exposure per trade, and more. All I want you\nto learn at this point, until it becomes second nature to you, is that a trade setup is made\nfollowing a smaller time frame momentum reversal in the direction of the larger time\nframe momentum. This is a completely objective, logical, and practical strategy for high\nprobability, low capital exposure trade setups for any market and any time frame. Trade\nsetups are not trade executions. Trade setups are simply conditions that must be met\nbefore a trade is considered.\nDuring this bond weekly period, bonds were essentially in a trading range, making\nnice swings up as well as down. The daily momentum made bullish reversals within a bar\nor two of each price low. However, because the higher time frame weekly momentum\nwas bearish during this period, only short setups would be considered. Wouldn’t it have\nbeen nice to know in late August that bonds were going to make nice, clearly deﬁned\ntrading range swings for the next four months! We could make a ton of money with a\ntrading range strategy. Wait a minute! We never know in advance when a trading range is\ngoing to begin or end, so we don’t have a trading range strategy. Only academic authors\nwith questionable trading experience have a trading range strategy, and we’re not going\nto listen to their nonsense.\nThe third weekly momentum trend was bullish from the week ending December 23\nthrough the week ending February 18 (Figure 2.11). During this higher time frame weekly\nbullish momentum period, the smaller time frame daily momentum made two bullish\nreversals. Each was followed by a strong move up.\nLet’s note a couple of important things at this point. First, I haven’t changed the daily\nmomentum settings for any of these examples to optimize the signals. You will learn\nhow to choose the best settings for any indicator later in this chapter. Second, I also\nhaven’t talked about stop-loss or exit strategies, both of which are crucial to a sound and\nconsistently proﬁtable trading plan. Those also come later in the book. Right now I’m\njust focusing on identifying trade entry setups based on the dual time frame momentum\nposition.\nLet’s look at the next period, when the higher time frame weekly momentum re-\nversed to bearish (Figure 2.12). During this period between the weeks ending February\n18 and April 8, the smaller time frame daily momentum made two bearish reversals.\nThe ﬁrst daily momentum bearish reversal during this period was made about three\nweeks after the weekly momentum turned bearish.

Be-\nlieve it and you should be on the road to success.\nThe purpose of all trade strategies is to identify conditions with a high probability\noutcome and acceptable capital exposure. The Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy is\na completely objective approach to identify trade setups as just one part of a comprehen-\nsive trade plan.\nThis approach is applicable to any actively traded market and any time frame,\nfrom position-trading with monthly, weekly, and daily data to day-trading with intra-\nday data. The principles and application are the same regardless of the market or time\nframe.\nThere are a couple of important questions about momentum studies and indicators\nthat you should have come up with so far: Which indicator should you use, and what are\nthe best settings or lookback periods to use? Let’s address both of these now.\nWHICH INDICATORS TO USE FOR MULTIPLE TIME\nFRAME MOMENTUM STRATEGIES\nI’ve made the point several times in this chapter that most price indicators represent\nabout the same thing, rate-of-change, and will give you about the same results for our\npurposes. In the examples so far, I’ve mostly used the DTosc, which is a proprietary\nindicator included with my Dynamic Trader software. Let’s take a look at other indicators\nyou can use and how to use them.\nThe stochastic (Stoch) indicator is very popular and included in all trading software.\nThe Stoch has overbought (OB) and oversold (OS) zones plus a fast and slow line, both\ncharacteristics that are helpful for our purposes.\nOverbought and oversold are not really good descriptive terms for an indicator that\nreaches extreme levels, but since these terms are commonly used, we will use them as\nwell. Just because an indicator reached the OB zone at the upper extreme of the indicator\nrange does not necessarily mean that the market itself is ready to turn down. It only\nmeans the indicator is near the extreme level. It will take some history and looking at\nmany momentum cycles for the indicator to determine if price is usually at or near a\nposition to make a reversal when the indicator reaches the OB or OS levels.\nAn indicator like the Stoch which has a fast and slow line is also helpful. The slow\nline of an indicator is usually just a moving average of the fast line. The slow line will\nreact more slowly to momentum change. When the fast line crosses the slow line, we\ncall it a momentum reversal. It warns that the rate of momentum is changing, which is\noften preceded or followed within a couple of bars by a directional price change.\nIf the fast line crosses above the slow line, it is called a momentum bullish reversal. If\nthe fast line crosses below the slow line, it is called a momentum bearish reversal. We’ll\ntalk more about indicator settings and lookback periods later, but for now we just want\nto learn about how an indicator acts and reacts to price momentum changes and how we\nmight use the OB/OS zones and momentum reversals as a trade setup.\n",

Figure 2.14 shows S&P\ndaily data for about a four-month period. This period had a series of well-deﬁned swings\nup and down with a bullish bias. I’ve drawn thick horizontal lines at the 75% OB and 25%\nOS zones, upward-pointing arrows for the momentum bullish reversals, and downward-\npointing arrows for the momentum bearish reversals.\nThe Stoch did a very good job of making momentum reversals within a bar or two of\neach price reversal, which would make it a good momentum indicator for our purposes.\nThe momentum reversals are not trade signals but conditions that must be met in order\nto consider a trade. Do you notice anything interesting about the position of the indicator\nreversals and the OB and OS zones?\nFor this series of S&P daily data, both lines of the Stoch reached well into the OB\nzone prior to a momentum bearish reversal. However, both lines did not typically reach\nthe OS zone prior to the momentum bullish reversals. Why is that? The trend bias for this\nperiod was bullish. It is a characteristic of a Stoch indicator to hang in the OB zone if the\ntrend is bullish and makes relatively shallow momentum corrections in the indicators,\n",

The larger-degree trend bias will affect how the Stoch indicator\ncycles.\nLet’s take a look at more data. The next daily S&P chart (Figure 2.15) was for a\nfour-month period with a strong bullish trend with only minor corrections. The chart has\nthe same Stoch indicator with the same settings as the previous chart. Do you note any\ndifferences in how the Stoch cycled with the price cycles in this chart compared to the\nearlier one?\nThe Stoch hung in the OB zone for much of the trend, only making momentum\ndeclines below the OB line on the larger corrections that lasted several bars. Frequent\nmomentum oscillations were made in the OB zone without a decline to below the OB\nline. This is a similar Stoch momentum pattern to what we saw on the previous chart,\nwhich had much larger corrections during the bullish trend. Even that chart showed a\nStoch bias to hang in the OB zone and make relatively shallow momentum corrections.\nFIGURE 2.15\nStochastic Momentum Reversals\n",

      "text": "34\nHIGH PROBABILITY TRADING STRATEGIES FOR ANY MARKET AND ANY TIME FRAME\nThe momentum pattern on this chart is just more pronounced because of the stronger\nbullish trend.\nSo it looks like we need to make a set of momentum trading rules for the wide swing-\ning periods with a modest bullish bias and a set of rules for a stronger bullish trend. That\nway, we can take full advantage of each market condition. At least, that is what some\ntrading educators will teach you: different rules for different market conditions. But as\nwe are well aware, you never know what type of trend is developing on the right-hand\nside of the chart. We can never have a different set of momentum rules for bull or bear\nor trading range, or for volatile or stable markets, or any other unique market condition,\nbecause we never know what type of market lies ahead. If we choose an indicator and a\nparticular set of settings, we have to stick to them until we have a very compelling reason\nto change.\nMACD Momentum Indicator\nThe moving average convergence divergence (MACD) momentum indicator is another\nvery popular indicator found in all charting packages and familiar to most traders. The\nMACD measures the difference between two moving averages and is usually displayed in\nthe indicator window as vertical bars in what is called a histogram. A shorter bar than a\nprevious bar represents a narrowing range between the two moving averages and a loss\nof momentum. If a bar is made on the other side of the center line (signal line), it means\nthe faster moving average has crossed above or below the slower moving average.\nMany traders base their momentum decisions on the MACD, and lots of systems\nand trade strategies have been developed around MACD signals and patterns. Does the\nMACD hold the momentum secret for traders? Let’s take a look at it.\nFigure 2.16 shows the same S&P daily data we used to look at the Stoch indicator.\nThe arrows show the momentum bullish and bearish reversals. A momentum bearish\nreversal occurs when a bar above the centerline (also called the signal line) is shorter\nthan the previous bar. A momentum bullish reversal is made when a bar below the cen-\nterline is shorter than the previous bar. Each of these situations represents a narrowing\nspread between the shorter-term moving average and the longer-term moving average,\nor a decrease in the momentum. A change in momentum represents a change in the\nprice rate-of-change. Usually it coincides with a change in the price trend, sometimes it\ndoes not.\nDo these momentum reversals represented by the up and down arrows look familiar?\nThey should. Every one of them is within one bar of the Stoch momentum reversals for\nthe same data you saw in Figure 2.14. It looks like both the Stoch and MACD give about\nthe same momentum information. This is no surprise since both are price indicators that\nrepresent about the same thing: a change in the rate-of-change of the price trend.\nA difference between the MACD and the Stoch is that the MACD does not have OB\nand OS zones. This doesn’t prevent you from using the MACD for Dual Time Frame\nMomentum Strategies. The change in bar heights works just ﬁne.\n",

The lookback period is\nthe number of bars back from the most recent bar that the indicator looks at to make the\nmomentum calculations.\nWhy may the settings change? Momentum trends cycle from low volatility and rela-\ntively infrequent momentum reversals to high volatility and relatively frequent momen-\ntum reversals. Ideally, we would have a system or indicator that would warn us of the\ntype of momentum cycles that will be made in the future. Unfortunately, no such system\nexists, any more than there is a system to project in advance when a market is going to\nbe in a trading range or a consistent trend. So occasionally, we may adjust the settings\nfor an indicator to reﬂect the most recent momentum volatility.\nWhat is the primary variable for most indicators? It is the lookback period, or the\nnumber of bars, prior to and including the most recent bar the indicator will use to make\nits calculations. The current value of any indicator is the relationship of the last com-\npleted bar to the lookback period. Everyone is familiar with a simple moving average. It\nis the average price of the past x number of bars, usually the close. The lookback period\nis the number of bars used to calculate the moving average.\nA longer lookback period will be less sensitive to price change than a shorter look-\nback period. It will take a longer period of recent momentum change to inﬂuence the\nlonger lookback period momentum indicator. The upside to the longer lookback period\nis there should be fewer false reversals made by short-term momentum changes. The\ndownside of the longer lookback period has the potential for a lag between price and\nmomentum reversals; price may have made a reversal several bars before the momen-\ntum indicator makes the reversal.\nLet’s take a look at a few charts and indicators and lookback periods. We’ll begin\nby looking at the same data with different indicator lookback periods to see which\nmay be more useful. Figure 2.18 is daily S&P Index (SPX) data with the DTosc with a\n21-day raw lookback period. The DTosc indicator is a combination of Stoch and RSI.\nFour numbers show in the indicator window. The ﬁrst number is the raw lookback pe-\nriod while the other numbers are periods the raw data is smoothed. Don’t get hung up on\nthe details of the indicator; just grasp the concept of how the indicator acts and reacts to\nprice trends based on the lookback period. How useful would this indicator have been\nto signal overbought and oversold positions and price reversals?\nTwo things are immediately obvious. While the indicator oscillated nicely with the\nprice swings, most of the indicator momentum reversals did not reach the OB or OS\nzone. For a two-line indicator like the DTosc, stochastic, and others, both the fast and\nslow line must be in the OB or OS zone to consider the indicator OB or OS. If an indicator\nhas an OB and OS zone, we want to use it to our advantage and ideally use an indicator\nlookback period so the indicator reaches the OB or OS zone most of the time before a\nmomentum reversal is made.\nThe second important factor is that most of the momentum reversals which are made\nwhen the fast line crosses above or below the slow line were made several bars after the\nextreme swing high or low and after price had moved a signiﬁcant distance from the\nhigh or low.

Are these settings going to continue to be useful in the future?” The\nanswer to that is “Usually.” I wish I could say “Always.” Some trading educators claim\nthere is one best set of settings for an indicator that you use all of the time. These guys\nhave probably never actually traded, because I can guarantee there will be periods when\nmarket volatility and momentum cycles change and the indicator settings you have been\nusing will be much less useful.\nSo here’s how it works. Look at a series of data for any market and any time frame.\nTest out a few lookback periods for your favorite indicator over two or three different\nperiods of time for the data and choose the most useful settings. Assume that these set-\ntings will continue to be useful. That’s the best you can do, and don’t let anyone tell you\notherwise. You’re not Nostradamus. You can’t see into the future. You can never know if\nthe volatility and momentum cycles will change in the future. You have to assume they\nwill continue.\nIf a market changes trend speed and volatility in the future and the best settings you\nhave found in the past are no longer optimal after a few momentum cycles, you may need\nto shorten or increase the lookback period.\nFigure 2.22 shows the data for several months following the examples I used\npreviously.\nThe same settings that were found to be useful for the earlier few months continued\nto be useful for months after. Near the end of the data shown in Figure 2.22, it looks\nlike the bull trend became stronger and the corrections smaller in time and price so\nthe indicator did not reach the oversold zone on the corrections. That doesn’t mean the\nindicator was not valuable, because if the larger time frame trend is bullish, any smaller\ntime frame momentum bullish reversal below the OB zone is a setup for a long trade.\nIf the indicator made a couple more oscillations without reaching the OS zone on the\ncorrections, we would probably change to a shorter lookback period.\nIt is a quick and easy process to ﬁnd the best indicator settings for any indicator\nand any market or time frame, as I have described. You are not looking for perfection. It\ndoesn’t exist. You are looking for the best ﬁt, and that is as good as it is ever going to get.\nIf you are ever taught by a book or course that there is one indicator and one setting that\nwill consistently make reversals at price highs and lows, drop the book or walk away\nfrom the classroom. You are not being taught the truth by an experienced and successful\ntrader.\nTrading is like any other business. You have to use the information available, study,\ngain experience, and make decisions. I wish we had room in the book to put a hun-\ndred more examples of Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy setups, indicators, and\ntheir settings. But this is just one chapter and just one part of the trading plan. It is\nmuch more important to understand the principles, concepts, and applications than\nto see lots of repetitive examples. If you understand the concepts and applications,\nyou will be able to use this information with any indicator, any market, and any time\nframe.\n",

If so, the upside may be very limited before the market reverses to continue\na bear trend to new lows. The pattern position may help to identify whether this is the\ncase, which will have an important inﬂuence on the immediate trade strategy. We would\nbe very cautious about taking a long trade if it is a corrective rally with little upside\npotential and would want to prepare for conditions for a reversal from a corrective high\nand a short trade to take advantage of a continued decline to a new low.\nThese are just a couple examples of how helpful it is to be aware of a few simple\npattern position guidelines, to help identify if a market is in a trend or correction and\nwhether the minimum conditions have been made to complete the trend or correction.\nSIMPLE PATTERN RECOGNITION BASED ON\nELLIOTT WAVE\nThe simple guidelines for pattern recognition and simple patterns in this chapter are\nbased on Elliott wave (E-wave) analysis. You may have already had some exposure to\nElliott wave analysis and become so confused by the overcomplicated approach to cycle\ndegrees, subdivisions, and alternate wave counts taught by E-wave academics that your\neyes are already starting to roll around. Stay with me, because in this chapter you are\ngoing to learn a very simpliﬁed, practical, and valuable approach to pattern recognition\nthat you will clearly understand and immediately be able to put into practice.\nE-wave analysis has been made way overcomplicated by E-wave academics. I know\ntraders who have got bogged down in the paralysis of E-wave analysis for years and never\nﬁgured out how to use it to make practical trade decisions. I’m going to teach you just one\nguideline and three patterns based on E-wave structure, which can be learned quickly\nand applied for practical trade strategies. You will learn how to look at any section of\ndata of any market and any time frame and quickly determine if a market is likely in a\ntrend or correction and if the pattern conditions have been made to complete the trend or\ncorrection. You will also learn how and why this information is valuable and how to make\nit a part of your trading plan. The pattern guidelines I teach for trends or corrections do\nnot involve a complicated counting scheme or getting lost in the paralysis of analysis.\nYou will learn just one key guideline to identify if a market is in a trend or correction,\nand just three patterns to help identify trend and correction position. That is all we need\nto help make speciﬁc and practical trade decisions. Identifying patterns is only academic\nunless we can use the information to make speciﬁc and practical trade decisions, which,\nof course, is what this book is about.\nTREND OR CORRECTION: THE OVERLAP\nGUIDELINE\nThere are two important pieces of information that we want the pattern position to tell\nus: Is a market in a trend or correction, and what is the position of the market within that\n",

This\nsimple piece of information can be very helpful to a trade strategy.\nThe key is to identify if a market is making a correction. Why? If a market is making\na correction, it should not take out the extreme that began the prior trend, but should\neventually continue the trend direction prior to the correction and make a new extreme.\nLet’s illustrate how this simple information can be very valuable.\nFigure 3.3 shows a market that is making a decline following a strong advance. If the\nmarket is making a correction to the bull trend, it should not decline below the March 14\nswing low shown on the chart and should eventually make a new high. It would be very\nvaluable to have reliable information if the decline is a correction, because the downside\npotential would be very limited and the upside following the end of the correction would\nbe very signiﬁcant.\nThere is one simple pattern guideline that is very reliable to warn if a market is\nprobably making a correction and not a new trend to a new extreme. If a market overlaps\na section, more than likely it is making a correction. An overlap is when a market makes\na new low or high, and then trades back into the range of the prior section.\nFIGURE 3.3\nTrend or Correction\n",

In Chapter 4, you will learn how to identify in advance\nthe high probability price target to complete an ABC and other corrections.\nWhile the simple ABC correction is a frequent type of correction, a correction can\ntake many forms. Let’s take a look at complex corrections.\nCOMPLEX CORRECTIONS\nA complex correction is any correction that makes more than three waves or sections.\nE-wave academics have identiﬁed 13 patterns of complex corrections. We are not going\nto examine the many patterns of complex corrections here. In fact, we’re not going to\nexamine any particular complex correction patterns because it serves little purpose for\npractical trade strategies. All that we want to do is recognize that a correction is probably\nbeing made. If we can do that, we know to orient our trade strategy to trade against the\ndirection of the correction for a probable continuation of the trend to a new high or low\nonce the correction is complete.\nA complex correction typically has several sections that overlap. That’s the\nkey—overlapping sections. Once we identify that the market should be making a cor-\nrective pattern and eventually trend to a new high or low, we can use other strategies\nincluding Dual Time Frame Momentum, price, and time position to help identify if the\ncorrection is in a position to be complete and continue the trend.\nFigure 3.14 is an example of a complex correction in the GBP/USD 60-minute data.\nWhile the last advance of the correction made a new high, the sections had already over-\nlapped and even made a slight new low; the pattern signals a correction to the bear trend\nwas probably being made, not a new bull trend. The GBP/USD eventually completed the\ncorrection and continued the bear trend to a new low.\nFigure 3.15 shows another complex correction for the EUR/USD 15-minute data. I’ll\nlet you tear your hair out putting labels on each of the sections in the correction. The\nmost important factor: Each of the small sections overlapped as the EUR/USD struggled\nhigher. Eventually a swing low was taken out, which usually signals a correction is com-\nplete, and the EUR/USD continued to decline to a new low, below the low where the\ncorrection began.\nIt is always easy to show after-the-fact examples. Just remember what you need to\nlearn here. If the sections overlap, more than likely a correction is being made. That\ninformation itself is very valuable and will help you to identify the probable position of a\nmarket and probable next major trend direction. The overlap will be an important signal\nto trade direction.\nFigure 3.16 is a GM daily chart showing another complex correction. Near the end of\nthe correction, GM traded to a new high for the correction but below the bull trend high\nshown on the chart, then traded back into the range of the ﬁrst section up, signaling more\nthan likely it was making a correction and would eventually continue lower. As soon as\na market makes the overlap, it is a strong pattern signal a correction is being made. The\n",

But many trends do, and knowing that a trend is usually at least ﬁve waves or\nsections provides us with valuable information to recognize when a trend May be in the\nﬁnal stages before a major trend reversal.

The Wave-4 did not close into the closing range of Wave-1, and the\nSPX has made a new low for a potential Wave-5 to complete the bear trend. The downside\nshould be limited before a Wave-5 low is made and a rally greater in time and price than\nany rally in the bear trend (the W.2 or W.4 corrections) begins. This is a description of\nwhat we know and the likely outcome.\nHow did it turn out? Go back to Figure 3.18, which illustrated the three E-wave guide-\nlines for ﬁve-wave trends. It includes the same data on this chart plus a couple of addi-\ntional weeks of data. The SPX made a sharp rally. The bear trend made ﬁve sections.\nDon’t make wave counting difﬁcult. Think in logical terms. If a correction is greater\nin time and price than any previous correction of the trend section, we can count it as\na completed wave or section. Let’s illustrate this. In Figure 3.21 I’ve labeled a ﬁve-wave\nbull trend on the QQQQ daily chart. The Wave-2 decline lasted just four days but was\ngreater in time and price than any correction during what is labeled the Wave-1 advance.\nSince that decline was greater in time and/or price, more than likely it is a completed\ncorrection to the trend section, or a Wave-2.\nFIGURE 3.21\nFive-Wave Trend, QQQQ\n",

Trends should be at least ﬁve waves, so the market has clearly indicated by the\npattern that a correction to the bull trend was being made. The correction may continue\nin a complex correction but—and here’s the key information—the QQQQ should even-\ntually make at least a ﬁve-wave trend to a new high. That is powerful information as of\nthe last bar on the chart. The downside should be relatively limited and the upside has\nsigniﬁcant potential.\nLet’s add some more data to the chart.

The last bar on the chart has made a new high\nfollowing a probable Wave-4 low. Since most trends end with ﬁve sections, the upside\nshould be relatively limited before the entire trend up from the W.C low is complete. You\nFIGURE 3.23\nTrends Are Usually at Least Five Waves\n",

It is a simple but reliable way to help determine\nwhether a section is complete.\nFigure 3.25 is daily QQQQ day and shows a four bar decline which is labeled a Wave-\n2. Up to this point in time, the largest decline was just two bars, which was much shorter\nin price than the four bar decline. Once the QQQQ made a new high, the larger four bar\ncorrection is probably a Wave-2 correction to the bull trend up to that point.\nNo matter what approach to technical analysis you use, you always have to make\nassumptions based on the information at hand. The outcome is never certain, but using\nthe “greater in time and/or price” correction assumption is a good one, at least until more\ndata is available that may prove it wrong.\nThe other “greater in time and/or price” assumption is that once a trend is complete,\nthe minimum expectation is that a correction greater in time and price should follow than\nany correction within the trend.

Note that\nI said the “minimum expectation.” Once a trend is complete, either a correction to that\ntrend will be made or a new trend in the opposite direction may begin. It depends on\nthe position of the just completed trend within the larger time frame trend. If we were\ngoing to get into different degrees or time frames of trend, we would just complicate\nmatters and have to learn about subdivisions of trends and more. Frankly, that is an\nentire course in and of itself, and we just don’t need it to make practical, high probability\ntrade decisions day by day.\nFIFTH WAVES ARE THE KEY\nThe most valuable piece of information regarding trends is that once waves 1 through 4\nare conﬁrmed, the trend should be in the ﬁnal stages. In our DT Reports we often say,\n“The trade to a new high (if a bull trend) conﬁrms a Wave-4 should be complete and the\nupside should be limited before a Wave-5 high is complete, which should complete the\nbull trend.” If a market is making new highs, the natural inclination for most traders is to\nbe very bullish. This is a good inclination in the early stages of a trend. It can be a very\ncostly inclination in the later stages of a trend. If we are aware that all of the guidelines\nto complete Waves 1 through 4 have been met, the swing to a new high could be a Wave-\n5 and the probable last swing up in a larger time frame. This information will be a huge\nadvantage and help us to be prepared for a top and major reversal just when most traders\nare very bullish.\nIf we just focus on this one pattern tendency of trends to usually make at least ﬁve\nsections with no overlaps, that information alone will be of enormous beneﬁt if four\nsections are complete. If a market is in a probable Wave-5, the next momentum reversal\ncould be the early signal the Wave-5 is complete and we can adjust our trade management\nstrategies accordingly. I will teach you more on how to use momentum to conﬁrm pattern\nposition in the chapters to come.\nFigure 3.26 is General Motors (GM) daily close data. Based solely on the probable\npattern position, what would you anticipate for GM in the days or weeks ahead?\nGM has made a new low, so the decline should be a trend, not a correction. If so,\nthree waves could be complete. If this is the case, following the completion of a Wave-4\ncorrective high, GM should make a new low. Not good news for the stockholders, given\nthat GM has already declined over 30% in a month. And, based on the pattern position,\nmore than likely GM will continue lower before the decline is complete. Ouch—unless\nyou’re short.\nFigure 3.27 is 15-minute data for the GBP/USD. What should you anticipate as of the\nlast bar on the chart?\nThe GBP/USD has made a ﬁve-wave decline, conﬁrmed by the trade above the proba-\nble Wave-4 high.

In addition, you will learn unique and very effective ways to identify\nhigh probability price target zones to use for practical trade strategies.\nIn this chapter, you will learn the difference between internal and external retrace-\nments and alternate price projections, and how together they identify not just support\nand resistance, but narrow-range price zones where corrections and trends usually end.\nEven if you are familiar with Fib retracements, don’t skip through this chapter as there\nshould be a lot of new information for you. Prepare to take your price analysis to a whole\nnew level with real-world, practical price trade strategies.\nI have taught this approach for almost two decades to all types of traders, from day\ntraders to position traders and for all types of markets, including Forex, futures, stocks,\nexchange-traded funds (ETFs), and even mutual funds. I call this approach to price Dy-\nnamic Price Strategy. Why not just call it Fibonacci price strategies? For two reasons.\nOne, we use some ratios that are not a direct part of the Fibonacci series but are just\nas important as the typical Fib ratios. And two, we use the ratios in ways other than the\ntypical retracement approach usually taught.\nI have reﬁned and simpliﬁed the Dynamic Price Strategy approach over the years to\nget to the core of practical, real-world price strategies that you can use for any market\nand any time frame. Let’s begin by learning internal retracements.\nINTERNAL RETRACEMENTS AND CORRECTIONS\nThere are two types of retracements: internal and external. The price retracements with\nwhich most traders are familiar are what I call internal retracements. If it is necessary\nto distinguish between internal and external retracements in this chapter, I will use the\nlabel In-Ret for internal retracements.\nInternal retracements are less than 100% and are primarily used to identify the price\ntarget to complete a correction. Even if you are familiar with so-called Fib retracements,\ndon’t skip this section. I want to be sure we are on the same page with the language,\nterms, and speciﬁc ratios used with the Dynamic Price Strategy.\nThe ratios used for internal retracements are .382, .50, .618, and .786. They are often\nexpressed as a percentage. The ﬁrst three ratios, .382, .50, and .618, are commonly called\nFib retracements, although .50 is not actually a Fib ratio. The fourth ratio, .786, may be\nnew to you unless you’ve taken some of my courses over the years. It is not a Fib ratio\nbut is closely related and an important retracement ratio that should always be included;\nit is the square root of .618.\nI won’t go through the history of the Italian Fibonacci and the ratios named after\nhim. The history and signiﬁcance of the ratios is thoroughly covered in other trading and\nnon-trading books.

Back to internal retracements: What are they and how do we make and\ndisplay them on a chart?\nFigure 4.1 shows the four key internal retracements for a bull section of the 60-\nminute data for an S&P mini futures (ES) contract.\nFIGURE 4.1\nInternal Retracements\n",

On the charts in this book, swing highs and lows are often\nlabeled with an arrow pointing to the high or low, as shown on the chart in Figure 4.1.\nThese are called date labels in the Dynamic Trader software. The user has a choice of\nwhat information to include with the labels, such as the date, time (if intraday data), price\nchange, percentage change, number of trading bars or calendar days, and the rate-of-\nchange (ROC). The Dynamic Trader software automatically calculates the price change,\npercentage change, number of trading bars or calendar days, and the ROC from the last\ndate label, so the user may have a lot of information included with the label. It is helpful\nif your trading software is able to at least label the date/time and price of swing highs\nand lows on any chart.\nIn Figure 4.1, the ES made an advance of 120.25 points from 1406.75 to 1527.00. The\nlow and high are labeled on the chart and the range of the advance is shown in the\ntop label. The range of 120.25 is proportioned by the four key ratios with the results\nsubtracted from the high price to arrive at the four retracement levels.\nMost trading software will have a retracement function. If yours doesn’t, your trading\nsoftware is probably not fully functioning or it is not designed for professional traders,\nand you need new trading software. Your trading software should allow you to enter any\nratio you choose and should allow you to choose to make the retracements by either the\nrange of price (highs and lows of the bars), as shown on the chart, or by closing prices.\nFigure 4.2 is the Price Retracement Ratios menu from my Dynamic Trader program.\nThe menu includes all of the possible options to choose ratios and how they are displayed\nand labeled, including the thickness and color of each line. Your trading software should\nat least give you the ability to choose any ratios to include for retracements, including\nratios greater than one. As you will see later in this chapter, ratios greater than one are a\nkey component of the Dynamic Price Strategy.\nBecause internal retracements are always less than 100%, they are used to help iden-\ntify price targets for corrections. Why is it helpful to know the key retracement price lev-\nels for any market we trade? Most corrections in every actively traded market and time\nFIGURE 4.2\nPrice Retracement Menu\n",

Am I supposed to make a reversal\ntrade every time a market reaches one of the four retracement levels?\nShowing simple Fib retracements is usually as far as most trading educators go. But\nthis chapter is called “Beyond Fib Retracements.” I promised to take you to another\nlevel with price strategies, and that is exactly what I am going to do. Retracement lev-\nels by themselves are not of much use for practical trade strategies. You could go broke\nmaking trend reversal trades every time a market reached a retracement level. There\nhas to be more to the price strategy that will help identify which retracement level is\nmost likely to be the end of a correction. We are not just looking for support or re-\nsistance; we want to identify the price level that will complete a correction so we can\neither cover a countertrend trade or enter a trade in the direction of the larger time\nframe trend at the end of a correction. Plus, we must be able to discern if there is a rel-\natively narrow-range of price around the retracement level that is a trend reversal price\nzone, so we don’t get hung up expecting the reversal to be made right at the retracement\nprice.\nI’m not going to show you dozens of examples of highs, lows, and corrective trend\nreversals made at the retracements. It is not instructive at this point. For now, all you\nhave to know is that most corrective highs and lows are made at or very near one of the\nfour internal retracements and how the retracements are made.\nHow do we identify in advance which retracement level is most likely to be the price\nnear where a correction is complete? We do this by also making alternate price pro-\njections and external retracements which will help to identify the internal retracement\nlevel that is likely to end a correction and not just be temporary support or resistance.\nEven though external retracements are more closely related to internal retracements, we\nare going to ﬁrst learn how to make and use alternate price projections to help qualify\nwhich internal retracement is most likely to be the price target for a corrective trend\nreversal.\nI also want to emphasize at this point that the objective is not just to identify tem-\nporary support or resistance. That is not particularly helpful. The objective is to identify\nthe probable price target that should end the entire corrective or trend structure.\nI N T E R N A L\nR E T R A C E M E N T S\nThe four internal retracement levels are 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%\nĹ Most corrections end at or very near the 50% or 61.8% retracement.\nĹ The 38.2% retracement level usually does not end a correction, but is only temporary\nsupport or resistance.\nĹ The 78.6% retracement is typically the maximum retracement for a correction. If a market\ncloses above the 78.6% retracement, typically it is not making a correction but will continue\nto trend to a new high or low.\n",

In some software, this routine\nis called extensions instead of Alternate Price Projections. Extensions is not a properly\ndescriptive term, but as long as you are able to make a projection from three points (two\npoints to measure the range, and make the projections from a third point), you will be\nable to accomplish the same thing. Alternate price projections are an equally important\nprice strategy as retracements. Be sure you are using trading software that allows you to\nmake these key price projections.\n",

An ex-\nternal retracement (Ex-Ret) is greater than 100%. The ratios usually used are 1.27, 1.62,\nand 2.62 and are often shown as percentages rather than ratios. Ex-Rets are made just\nlike the more familiar In-Rets. The external retracements are most useful to identify the\nﬁnal section of a trend or countertrend such as a Wave-5 of a ﬁve-wave trend, the Wave-\nC of an ABC correction, or the ﬁnal section of complex correction. Of course, we never\nknow for sure if a market is making the ﬁnal section of a trend or countertrend, but if\nthe pattern conditions have been met such that it could be the ﬁnal section, the external\nretracements are an important factor to help identify the probable price target for trend\nreversal.\nFigure 4.12 is the same USD/JY daily chart used in an earlier APP example but only\nshows the three external retracements.\nThe 127%, 162%, and 262% external retracements are shown for the A-B range. The\ntwo most typical Ex-Rets where a trend reversal is often made are the 127% and 162%,\nwhich we always focus on. In this example, the 262% Ex-Ret is above the high of the bear\ntrend section, so it is not relevant to identify the end of a correction for this data. Let’s\nadd the In-Rets and APPs to the chart to see if there are one or two relatively narrow-\nrange zones that ideally include one each of the three sets of projections.\nFigure 4.13 is the same USD/JY daily data.

You might also consider specializing in just one or two types of very\nhigh probability setups for your trading as well. You may have fewer trade setups but,\nlike specialists in other businesses, there is a good chance your success will be greater.\nWhile many corrections make a pattern other than an ABC, if the minimum condi-\ntions for an ABC have been made, it is essential to consider the potential for an ABC\nand project the price target for a Wave-C. While many trends do not complete with ﬁve\nsections or waves that meet the guidelines for an E-wave ﬁve-wave trend, if four sections\nare complete that meet the guidelines for a ﬁve-wave trend, it is essential to make the\nprice projections for a possible Wave-5 which may complete the entire trend. This does\nnot mean that the Dynamic Price Strategies are not useful for any other pattern structure.\nLater in this book, I include lots of examples of how all the trade strategies are useful for\nnon-three-wave ABC corrections and non-ﬁve-wave trends. Since the three-wave, ABC\ncorrections and ﬁve-wave trends are so prevalent in all markets and all time frames, we\nwill focus on making the high probability end-of-wave (EOW) price targets for each of\nthese patterns.\nABC Price Targets\nA simple ABC correction is a frequent type of correction. An ABC correction is also called\na Gartley pattern. It has well-deﬁned minimum guidelines to recognize if two sections are\ncomplete. Once two sections are complete (waves A and B) there are very speciﬁc price\nstrategies to help identify the EOW-C price target.\nThe probable End-of-Wave-C price target is identiﬁed in advance by making three\nsets of projections you have already learned. In fact, a couple of the earlier examples\nused projections for an ABC price target. We can never know for sure if a market is\nmaking a correction.

We never know if a correction will be a simple ABC or something\nmore complex, but we always assume a correction will be at least three sections.\nWe can make completely objective price projections and identify relatively narrow-\nrange price zones based on the three sets of price projections, with the focus on the\ninternal retracements, and be prepared in advance for the high probability price target\nto complete an ABC correction. If a market reaches that zone, it has met the price condi-\ntions for a probable reversal.

No speciﬁc software or system will make you a successful trader.\nPowerful computers, comprehensive trading software, and inexpensive data have not\nmade anyone a trading success.

If it doesn’t, close the book now, go out and play golf or whatever you do\nfor fun, and come back later when you’ve gained some sense and understanding about\nwhat the business of trading is all about!\nFigure 4.22 is the ES (S&P mini) 60-minute futures data that was used to illustrate\nthe end-of-Wave-5 price targets earlier. You might remember that the three key targets\nall fell within less than two points of each other for a high probability target zone. Only\nthe 100% APP is shown on this chart so it can be easily read.\nAs of the last bar on the chart, the S&P has reached the high probability price target\nfor a Wave-5 low and made a momentum bullish reversal on a bullish momentum/price\ndivergence. This is an ideal setup for a long trade with minimal capital exposure and a\nlot of upside potential.\nOnce again, what do we know? We know the pattern, price, and momentum are all in\na position typical to complete a ﬁve-wave trend low. We know the downside is relatively\nlimited to ﬁnd out if a low is complete, and the upside is substantial. We don’t know if\nthe S&P has made a trend reversal low that will be followed by a substantial advance; the\nS&P may continue lower. However, we have identiﬁed “conditions with a high probability\noutcome and acceptable capital exposure,” the objective of all trade plans. That is what\ntrade setups are all about.\nThese have been just a couple of examples to give you a preview of how the momen-\ntum, pattern, and price factors are each used as part of a trading plan. You will see lots\nmore in Chapters 6 and 7, plus speciﬁc entry-to-exit plans. We’ll get there before long,\nbut ﬁrst you will learn about the time factor in the next chapter.\n",

The Dynamic Time Strategies you learn will put\nyou miles ahead of traditional cycle analysis with timing tools for\npractical trade strategies.\nW\nhen most traders think of market timing, they think of traditional cycle strate-\ngies. Traditional cycle strategies project a low or a high based on an average\nlength of low-low or high-high cycles of past data. This type of cycle analysis\nmakes assumptions that usually prove to not hold up in reality.\nTraditional cycles are based on an average cycle length. An average cycle length is\nusually pretty useless because it does not consider how tight or widespread are the range\nof numbers used that make the average. If most of the cycle repetitions that were used\nto come up with the average cycle were tightly grouped, the average would be useful.\nUnfortunately, an average can be made of any series of numbers which may be widely\ndispersed. The average may be meaningless to predict the next repetition.\nTraditional market cycle analysis also assumes a cycle length is static and the static\ncycle will continue indeﬁnitely into the future. It just doesn’t work that way. Price and\nvolatility cycles change over time. What might have been a fairly regular cycle in the past\nmay no longer be evident in recent market activity. Cycles are not static, but dynamic.\nThe typical L-L or H-H cycle length are generally different for bull and bear markets and\nwill ﬂuctuate over time as volatility and price cycles ﬂuctuate. Plus, markets generally\nmake their highs and lows at dynamic proportions of past trends and countertrends.\nJust as you discovered in Chapter 4 that most trend and corrective highs and lows\nare made at or very near proportions of recent sections of the trend or correction, a\nsimilar approach to dynamic time proportion will help identify time targets for reversal.\nIn this chapter you will learn a logical and practical approach to time target analysis\n111\n",

      "text": "112\nHIGH PROBABILITY TRADING STRATEGIES FOR ANY MARKET AND ANY TIME FRAME\nthat I have developed over the past 20 years. I have taken the Dynamic Time Strategies\nfrom a very complex to a simpliﬁed approach that every trader should make a part of\nhis trading plan. In many cases, you will be able to identify in advance high-probability,\nnarrow range time targets of just three to four bars for trend reversal for any market and\nany time frame. Let’s begin by learning about time retracements.\nTIME RETRACEMENTS AND CORRECTIONS\nTime retracements are made in the same way as price retracements except time units are\nused instead of price units. If most corrections are made at or near one of the key price\nretracements, why shouldn’t they also be made at or near a time retracement? That is a\nquestion I asked myself many years ago when studying Gann price and time strategies.\nGann price and time analysis often seems very complicated but for the most part, it\nboils down to a simple concept: Most highs and lows are made in proportion to one or\nmore previous sections of the trend or countertrend. In Chapter 4 you learned how to\nmake price retracements and alternate price projections to help identify in advance the\nprobable price target for support, resistance, and, most important, reversal of trends and\ncorrections. If most reversals are made at or very near the key proportional price target\nzones, shouldn’t they also be made near key proportional time target zones?\nOver the past 20 years, I have found this to be the case. Time retracements are made\njust like price retracements but on the time axis, and they use some of the same ratios\nused for price retracements. The ratios for time retracements are .382, .50, .618, 1.00, and\n1.618. In most cases, we just use the .382, .618, and 1.00 proportions to help identify time\ntargets for corrections. The ratios are often expressed as percentages, just like with price\nretracements.\nFigure 5.1 is daily XAU data. From mid-August to early November, the XAU made\na strong bull trend for 58 trading days. The date-time range label above the high on the\nchart shows the top was made November 7, 2007, 58 bars (trading days) from the August\n16 low. As of the last bar on the chart, the XAU has made a sharp decline. Along the\nbottom of the chart, the .382, .618, and 1.00 time retracement dates are shown. The 58-bar\nbull trend was proportioned into the .382, .618, and 1.00 ratio segments and the results\nprojected forward in time from the November 7 high.\nThe time retracements were made in the exact same way as price retracements. The\nnumber of time units of the bull or bear trend is measured, then proportioned by the time\nretracement ratios, and the results are projected forward in time from the last bar of the\nbull or bear trend. A correction to a bull or bear trend is usually complete in the 38% to\n62% time retracement (TR) zone. With internal price retracements, we look at a speciﬁc\nprice for each retracement. With time retracements and corrections, we ﬁrst look at the\nrelatively broad 38% to 62% TR zone as the high probability target where a three-section\ncorrection is usually complete. This simple piece of information itself—the 38% to 62%\ntime retracement zone for a simple correction—is very useful. If a market is making a\n",

Are there\nother time factors that may narrow a relatively broad time zone to pinpoint the probable\ntime target for a corrective high or low?

Time retracements and alternate\ntime projections work together in a logical manner to help identify speciﬁc time targets\nto complete a correction.\nFigure 5.4 shows the Time Projection Ratios Using 3 Dates menu. The user may\nchoose any set of ratios. The time range of the ﬁrst two data points is measured and\nthe proportions are made from a third data point.\nThe three ATPs give us a minimum, probable, and maximum ATP to complete the\nthird section of a correction. By themselves, they provide useful timing information.\nWhen used with the time retracements, they provide even more important information.\nFigure 5.5 is the same XAU daily data with both the time retracements and alternate\ntime projections shown on the chart. The ﬁrst important thing to note is that all three\nof the alternate time projections fall within the December 11 to January 2, 38% to 62%\ntime retracement zone. The minimum 62% ATP is December 18 and the maximum 162%\nis December 31, so right away, the target zone for a corrective low is narrowed by several\ndays from the time retracement zone. Because the 62% ATP is December 18, more than\nlikely a corrective low will not be complete prior to December 18 and typically would\nbe complete around December 21, the 100% ATP. The maximum time target to expect a\nWave-C low is December 31, the 162% ATP.\nSo far, you can see how time retracements and alternate time projections work to-\ngether to help identify a time target in the same manner as price retracements and al-\nternate price projections. They are both made in the same way using price units or time\nunits. Alternate price projections qualify which price retracement is likely to be where\nsupport/resistance or trend reversal is likely to be made. Alternate time projections help\nto narrow a relatively wide time retracement zone to a narrower time target for reversal.\n",

Each is a logical\nproportion of prior sections. We begin with the broad time retracement range and narrow\nthe time range with the position of the ATP and cycle projections. If a relatively narrow\ntime range is made from the three sets of projections, it is a high probability time target\nto complete a corrective low. Does this approach sound familiar? It is the same basic\napproach used with the Dynamic Price Strategy to identify in advance the probable price\nzone or zones for a corrective high or low.\nFigure 5.8 includes all three sets of time projections. I realize the chart is a bit\ncrowded, showing all six projections together, but let’s see how we can make a logical\nchoice for a probable time target for a Wave-C if the XAU is making an ABC correction.\nThe last bar on the chart has made a new low on December 17 from the November\n7 high. The XAU has already reached the December 11 to January 2, 38% to 62% time\nretracement zone. So far, so good.

A Wave-C low was made on December 18, right\nin the December 17–22 time target for a low which was projected in advance. The XAU\nreached a price target for the low where the 50% price retracement and 62% alternate\nprice projection coincided, also projected in advance, and where the daily momentum\nwas oversold and made a bullish reversal two days after the extreme low in price and\ntime.

      "text": "122\nHIGH PROBABILITY TRADING STRATEGIES FOR ANY MARKET AND ANY TIME FRAME\nIs every corrective low made in the 38 to 62% time retracement zone? No, but most\nsimple corrections are. At the least, this range gives us the typical minimum time target\nfor a corrective low, a very valuable and practical piece of information itself, to warn\nus that a new low made prior to the 38% time retracement is not likely to complete a\ncorrection. Is every simple corrective low made at one of the three alternate time projec-\ntions? No, but most are, so they are very valuable to help identify when a corrective low\nis probable. Is every corrective low made at the recent 100% low-low (or high-to-high)\nprojection? No, but many are, particularly if several of the recent low-low cycles are in a\nrelatively narrow range.\nThe Dynamic Time Strategy is used in a logical sequence of time projections to nar-\nrow a relatively wide time target zone to a narrower zone, sometimes as little as just\ntwo or three bars. This same strategy is used on all actively traded markets and all time\nframes.\nSo far, we’ve used one example of a simple ABC correction to illustrate the whole\nprocess. The Dynamic Time Strategy is used for all market conditions, not just simple\nABC corrections. We never know in advance what form a correction may take. For that\nmatter, we don’t even know for sure if a correction is being made or a new trend. But\nif the larger time frame trend analysis suggests a correction is being made, the ﬁrst as-\nsumption is it will be at least three sections. If it continues beyond three sections, don’t\ndespair—the Dynamic Time Strategy will still help provide the time target to complete\nthe correction.\nLet’s take a look at a couple of more examples. Figure 5.10 is 15-minute EUR/GBP\ndata covering less than two days of data. I don’t want to encourage day trading. In the\nﬁnal chapter you’ll read my thoughts about day trading and why most traders should\navoid it. But even if you’re not a day trader, you can use intraday setups to position\nyourself for a swing or position trade.\nThe EUR/GBP made a ﬁve-wave decline to the low on the chart, followed by a choppy\nadvance. The advance had overlapping sections, which warns it is probably some sort of\ncomplex corrective advance and not a new bull trend. The objective is to identify the\nprobable time target to complete a corrective high.\nThe top horizontal line shows the 62% and 100% time retracements. The advance has\nalready gone beyond the 38 to 62% time retracement zone, which is the typical time target\nfor a three-section, ABC correction. Most complex corrections will be complete by the\n100% time retracement. This is logical. The time range of a corrective section will usually\nnot exceed the time range of a trend section. The 100% time retracement is just a few\nbars past the last bar on the chart. A corrective high should be complete soon.\nThe 100% high-high projection is just a couple of bars past the high made as of the\nlast bar on the chart, another sign a high is due soon if not already complete. The alter-\nnate time projections are not shown with the horizontal lines like in previous examples\nbecause it would crowd the chart. However, the last two low-high time counts were ﬁve\nand seven bars. The last high shown on the chart was eight bars, which is just one bar be-\nyond the most recent alternate time projection of seven bars. This is another time factor\nthat suggests at least a minor high is at or near completion.\n",

Consider the logic of the time factors. The 100% time re-\ntracement of the ﬁve-wave bear trend is just a few bars away. The 100% time retracement\nis typically the maximum time retracement for a complex correction. The 100% high-high\ncycle is just a couple of bars away.

That’s not going to happen. The\nobjective is to identify conditions with a high probability outcome and acceptable capital\nexposure.\nTIME BANDS\nTime Bands are similar to the traditional style of cycle analysis but with a more relevant\nand useful approach. Walter Bressert, who is considered the father of ﬁnancial cycle\nanalysis, developed this approach in the early 1980s. This approach to identifying time\ntargets for a low or high in any market and any time frame is quick and simple to do. As\nusual, let’s jump right into a real-world example to learn how to make Time Bands.\n",

This is a relatively narrow range of time to anticipate a high,\nbut we should be able to do even better than that and narrow the range to fewer days.\nBefore you learn how to complete the Time Band for a more narrow range time\ntarget, a few comments are necessary. First, you have to use some judgment in choosing\nthe high or low pivots. In most cases the relevant pivots are the obvious swing highs\nand lows, but also look for periods of market consolidation that ﬁt in with the typical\nhigh-high counts that have been made.\nOver the past 20 years, I’ve tested many approaches to automatically identify the cy-\ncle highs and lows, including percentage change of price movement, factors of average\ntrue range, Gann swing charts, momentum cycles, and more. None has proved satisfac-\ntory, and each of these approaches has inherent weaknesses that either miss relevant\npivots or include irrelevant pivots. I have built into the Dynamic Trader software an auto\nswing mode which will pick highs and lows either by percentage change in price or by\nfactors of the average true range. While it saves a lot of time on the ﬁrst run through\nto pick the highs and lows, in almost every case when the auto swing mode is used, I\nﬁnd I need to edit the swing ﬁle because not all the relevant pivots were picked by the\nauto mode.\nBeware of any so-called cycle software that allegedly identiﬁes pivots without any\nuser input. As I’ve said many times before, all aspects of trading are like any other busi-\nness. You can’t buy success. You have to gain knowledge and experience and make\ndecisions. While identifying the relevant pivots for Time Band targets is 80% or so ob-\njective, with any set of pivots you will have to use some common sense and make some\ndecisions which pivots to include.\nAnother decision you will have to make is whether to eliminate outlier counts. In\nmost cases, it is obvious. If most of the periods are within a relatively narrow range like\nthe DJIA in Figure 5.16, and there is one outlier on each end of the range, they can be\neliminated. If the periods are fairly evenly spread through a wide range with no obvious\noutliers, the entire range of periods is used but will probably result in too wide a range\nfor the Time Band projection to be useful. You have to use whatever information the\nmarket provides and then make decisions to arrive at the best results.\nThe ﬁnal decision is how many repetitions are enough for a reliable Time Band pro-\njection. Probably not as many as you think—as few as ﬁve or six are enough. I rarely go\nback more than 10 or 12 pivot highs or lows. If cycle periods have stayed within a rela-\ntively narrow range of time, the assumption is the recent time rhythm will continue. We\nare interested in the recent time rhythm of the market, not the time rhythm of the distant\npast. We are trading today’s market and are interested in the current trends, volatility,\nand time rhythms, not what happened months or years ago.\nLet’s complete the Time Band with the second set of counts and see if we can narrow\nthe relatively wide high-high band to a more narrow range.\nThe second set of counts when making a Time Band for a high is the low-to-high\n(L-H) counts using the same high pivots used to identify the high-high cycles. On the\nchart in Figure 5.17, I’ve marked the lows between the high pivots. The new time\n",

The range of low-\nto-high counts is from 5 to 13 trading days. There were several counts on the data to the\nleft of the chart not shown that were in the low end of the 5 to 13 trading day range.\nThere were no obvious outliers, so the entire 5 to 13 trading day range is used.

The 13 trading day count from the last low on September 25 is October\n12. If the recent low-high time rhythm that has been made for the past several months\ncontinues, a comparable high should be made by October 12.\nThe Time Band combines the high-high count range and the low-high count range.\nThe overlap of the two ranges is the Time Band and a high probability time target for the\nnext comparable high.

They\nwill eliminate the emotion and indecisiveness once the trade deci-\nsion is made. Knowing the maximum position size for any trade\nwill be a key factor in your trading success.\nS\no far you have learned the four factors of multiple time frame momentum, pattern,\nprice, and time used to identify market conditions with a high probability outcome\nto consider a trade. This doesn’t mean a trade should be entered every time these\nconditions are made. It just means there is a potential trade.\nNow we set the speciﬁc conditions to execute the trade including the entry price and\ninitial protective stop-loss. Most of the time a trade will be executed. However, some-\ntimes the market will not react as anticipated and will not meet the trade execution\nconditions.\nWhile there is some judgment involved to identify the best trade conditions based on\nwhat you have learned so far, the trade entry strategy is completely objective. Once the\nconditions are in place for a probable correction reversal or trend reversal, there is no\nmore thinking, and no more judgments to be made. The entry strategy is objective.\nIn this chapter, you will learn just two speciﬁc entry strategies. Both are similar in\nthat they require the market to move in the anticipated direction before the trade is en-\ntered. This is crucial. I don’t recommend buying or selling at a price target. There is too\ngreat a risk of the market continuing through the price target. Why not wait for the mar-\nket action itself to give some evidence that it is going to do what you anticipate it should\ndo, before entering the trade?\nAn entry strategy must have a speciﬁc buy/sell price and a speciﬁc initial protective\nstop price.

Brokers don’t take vague\nor approximate orders. They take speciﬁc price orders, so that is what you are going to\nlearn: practical, simple, and, most important, logical entry strategies based on the market\nposition.\nStops are always placed at the exact price that will void the setup. That’s the key\nto stops. What can the market do that will void the very condition that prompted the\ntrade? That is where the stop-loss is placed. If a market voids the condition that caused\nthe trade to be taken, there is no reason to remain in the position. You want to be out\nquickly with an acceptable loss rather than potentially ending up with an unacceptable\nand possibly ruinous loss.\nThis chapter is just about entry strategies, which include the speciﬁc entry price and\ninitial protective stop-loss. It is not about how to adjust the stop-loss if the market moves\nin the anticipated direction, and it is not about exit strategies. Those are the subjects of\nChapter 7. For most of the examples in this chapter, I focus on the speciﬁc entry strategy\nand don’t go into much detail about the momentum, pattern, price, and time position that\nmade the probable trade setup. Some of these other factors are shown, but the focus is on\nthe speciﬁc entry strategy. We’ll put all of the factors together in a more comprehensive\nway when you learn to plan a trade from entry to exit in later chapters.\nIn this chapter you will also learn about other completely objective decisions, in-\ncluding the maximum capital exposure (risk) and maximum position size for any trade,\nunder any conditions, and for any market.\nENTRY STRATEGY 1: TRAILING ONE-BAR\nENTRY AND STOP\nThe trailing one-bar-high (or low) entry (Tr-1BH/L) is very simple and logical and will\nusually put you into the trade with a very close stop. Once the conditions are in place for\na reversal and following the lower time frame momentum reversal, trail the buy-stop or\nsell-stop to enter the trade one tick above the high or below the low of the last completed\nbar. Place the initial protective stop one tick beyond the swing high or low made prior to\nentry.\nLet’s take a look at an example. Figure 6.1 is the XAU daily data. As of the last bar\non the chart, the XAU has reached the 50% retracement, is near the 100% low-low cy-\ncle, and has made a daily momentum bullish reversal. There are several other time and\nprice factors for support that you’ve learned in previous chapters, but the ones shown\nhere are just a couple that demonstrate the XAU is in a position for a possible Wave-C\nlow. We’ll assume for now the higher time frame weekly momentum was either oversold\nor bullish, which are the higher time frame momentum conditions to consider a long\ntrade following the lower time frame daily momentum bullish reversal. In Chapter 2 we\nsaw that if a market has reached a higher time frame oversold position, the immediate\n",

The initial conditions are the same as with\nthe trailing bar entry strategy. The dual time frame momentum, price, pattern, and time\nconditions for a corrective or trend reversal must ﬁrst be in place. The higher time frame\nmomentum is either bull or bear OS for a long trade, or bear or bull OB for a short trade.\nThe smaller time frame momentum makes a reversal in the direction of the higher time\nframe. Once these conditions with a high probability outcome are in place, the swing\nentry strategy requires the market to take out a swing high or low in the direction of the\nanticipated trend.\nWith the swing entry (SE) strategy, the capital exposure is usually greater than with\nthe TR-1-BH(L) strategy because the entry price is usually further away from the ini-\ntial protective stop price. On the plus side, the SE strategy should have a higher rate of\nsuccess. Every entry strategy has a trade-off. An entry strategy made very soon after a\nsmaller time frame momentum reversal may have a lower rate of success but a smaller\ncapital exposure, while an entry strategy with a higher rate of success will often have a\nlarger capital exposure.\nDon’t confuse the swing entry strategy with swing trading. Swing trading has be-\ncome a buzzword the past few years and doesn’t represent any one particular strategy.\nPure swing trading is buying each new swing high or selling each new swing low to enter\nin the direction of the trend. It’s a great strategy in a strongly trending market, but you get\nkilled if the swing is the ﬁnal section of a trend or a market is entering a choppy, trading\nrange period. With the approach you are learning in this book, a swing entry is only made\nonce the conditions are in place for a reversal, and the entry is made on a minor swing in\na lower time frame to reduce the initial capital exposure.\nLet’s take a look at a swing entry strategy. Figure 6.11 is 60m S&P mini (ES) fu-\ntures contract. The low on the chart is a potential Wave-5 low. To keep the chart un-\ncluttered, I am not showing the time and price targets near the low, which suggest\nEOW-5 time and price support. The higher time frame daily momentum (not shown)\nis bear OS, a position to consider a long trade following a smaller time frame 60m mo-\nmentum bullish reversal. A momentum bear OS position implies the downside should\nbe limited and a bullish reversal is probable following the next lower time frame mo-\nmentum bullish reversal. The last bar on the chart is the last 60m bar for November\n27 for the pit hours session. Non-pit-hours session data is not considered since the\nvolume is so low. The 60m ES has made the momentum bullish reversal. The swing\nentry for the following day is one tick above the prior swing high. If the entry is ex-\necuted, the initial protective sell-stop is one tick below the swing low made prior\nto entry.\nWe don’t know if the market is going to continue to advance and take out the swing\nhigh. For all we know it could continue to decline or chop sideways. What we do know is\nas of November 26, the ES is in a position to complete a Wave-5 low and a trade above the\nswing high should conﬁrm a Wave-5 low is complete. If the ES takes out the swing high,\nit would void any logical bear pattern and be a reason to be long. We call this a pattern\nreversal signal. If this is the case, the ES should rally for at least two to three weeks\n",

If you do not have the patience and discipline to wait for conditions with a\nhigh probability outcome according to your trade plan, you are not a trader. You are a\ngame player with no respect for rules that should keep you safe, and you will eventually\ncontribute your trading account to the pros who have patience and follow the rules. Get\nsmart.

Never buy or sell at a target price. Always\nrequire the market to move in the direction of the anticipated trend to execute a trade,\nand I’m sure you will ﬁnd your results improve substantially.\nPOSITION SIZE\nCapital preservation is a key to long-term successful trading. Almost everyone has seen\nthe numbers of how much percentage gain it takes to make up a loss. A 20% drawdown\ntakes a 25% gain just to get back to breakeven. A 50% drawdown takes a 100% gain to get\nback to even. It takes a lot to make up a signiﬁcant loss.\nToo many traders swing for the fences with visions of big proﬁts from big positions.\nThat’s a pipe dream. Big positions can result in big losses that are very difﬁcult to recover.\nThere will come a time when you think you’ve got the market wired. Every technical\nposition from short- to long-term points to one thing: a major trend. You break every\ncommonsense risk rule and commit your account to the position with a wide stop “to\ngive it room.” The market moves against you and you think it is a buying opportunity to\nadd even more positions at a better price. You know the end of this story. The market\ndoesn’t stop moving against you and you either exit with a major loss or are taken out by\nthe broker when you run out of capital for margin.\nA major loss is very difﬁcult to recover from, both emotionally and ﬁnancially. Suc-\ncessful traders always have a relatively close stop. If stopped out for a loss, it is an\nacceptable loss. It is absolutely critical to minimize losses and preserve capital. It is\nthat simple. Assume any trade you place could be a loser, and never risk more than a\nsmall amount of capital on any one trade or any group of open trades.\nThe best professional traders rarely have a greater than 50% win record. That’s\nright. Long-term successful traders usually have more losers than winners. Most ama-\nteur traders simply don’t accept this reality, which is why they are not ruthless about\nlimiting the potential loss on any one trade. Listen up, reader. If you have better than a\n50% winning trade percentage over time, you are among the trader elite. If you get good\nat trading, you will have around a 30 to 40% win percentage. That is why it is absolutely,\npositively, unquestionably critical that the losses on losing trades are relatively small\nand proﬁts on winning trades are relatively large. There is no other way to trading\nsuccess.\n",

Most trading educators call this risk. Risk is the probability of an event\nhappening and has nothing to do with a dollar amount. Risk is not a proper term for the\ndollars that may be lost. Capital exposure is a much better term. However, since risk has\nbecome a term associated with the amount of capital that could be lost, I’ll occasionally\nuse the term since it has become a convention.\nLet’s get down to brass tacks and learn what every successful trader puts into prac-\ntice. The maximum capital exposure for any trade must be relatively small and the max-\nimum capital exposure per trade unit will determine maximum position size.\nThere are many complicated methods to determine position size but the simplest is\nthe best. When I ﬁrst started trading in the mid-1980s, the teachings of W. D. Gann were\nmy main guide. One of Gann’s rules was to never risk more than 10% of your account\ncapital on a position. That rule is often repeated. Over the years, I have had many ex-\npensive lessons that 10% is way too much to risk on any one trade. Professional traders\nonly risk a very small amount of capital on any one trade and a small maximum amount\non all open trades. Three percent maximum capital exposure on any one trade and 6%\nmaximum exposure on all open trades is the accepted standard, and it is a good one.\nThe maximum exposure should be a percentage of the account equity available. If\nyour available equity is $20,000, the maximum capital exposure on a trade should be\n$600 ($20,000 × 3 percent). The maximum capital exposure on all open trades should be\n$1,200 ($20,000 × 6 percent). It’s that simple. If you go over these limits, you are stacking\nthe odds of success against you and you are not conducting your business of trading in a\nresponsible manner.\nMost traders also have a maximum loss that is acceptable for any one month. If that\nmaximum is reached, they stop trading for the month. A maximum monthly loss must\nbe no more than 10 percent. If closed trades have resulted in a 10% drawdown to the\naccount in less than a month, stop trading for the balance of the month. Either you or\nyour trading plan needs a time out. There will always be opportunities next month. Take\na breather.\nMaximum position size is a function of maximum initial capital exposure per trade\nunit. First, calculate the maximum trade capital exposure of 3% of available account\nbalance. Then calculate the capital exposure per unit based on the objective entry price\nand initial protective stop. The unit could be a futures contract or per share. Finally,\ndivide the maximum account capital exposure by the trade unit capital exposure to arrive\nat the maximum position size for the trade.\nFigure 6.17 is 15m ES.

You lack the discipline to make\nlogical and sound trading decisions and are playing at something other than real-world,\nprofessional trading. You have risked more capital than allowed by any logical trading\nplan.\nHow to Calculate Maximum Position Size:\nAvailable Capital × 3%\nCapital Exposure per Unit = Maximum Position Size\nIf this math confuses you, stop trading right now. I mean it. You need to be able to\nunderstand simple concepts and mathematics to be a successful trader. And this is as\nsimple as it gets.\nYears ago, I set up a simple spreadsheet to calculate maximum position size. All I\nhave to do is enter the entry and stop price, value of each tick, and the account balance,\nand it gives you the maximum position size. You can set up a simple spreadsheet yourself\nor you can download one in MS Excel from www.highprobabilitytradingstrategies.com.\nIn most cases, you won’t need a spreadsheet or even a calculator to quickly ﬁgure out\nthe maximum position size. It is not very complicated.\nThe maximum capital exposure for all open positions should be 6% of available cap-\nital. Never get beyond this limit. Always remember, capital preservation is critical to\nsuccess. All successful traders limit the potential loss on any one trade to a relatively\nsmall amount. Limited capital exposure on any one trade does not guarantee success,\nbut it will give you the opportunity for success.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this chapter, you have learned two objective entry strategies that can be used with any\nmarket, any conditions, and any time frame. Both entry strategies require the market to\nmove in the anticipated direction before a trade is executed. That is a key concept that\nevery entry strategy should have. With an objective entry strategy, there is no decision\nto be made for the entry price and initial protective stop-loss once the high probability\ntrade conditions have been identiﬁed. Those two prices are determined by the market\nposition and entry strategy, and you will know the maximum trade unit capital exposure\nbefore any trade is executed.\nYou have also learned that limiting losses on any one trade to a relatively small\namount is critical to long-term success. You also learned how to quickly calculate the\nmaximum position size for any trade.\nNow that we know how to identify optimal trade conditions and objective strategies\nto enter the trade and protect capital, it is time to complete the trading plan and learn\nabout trade management and exit strategies.\n",

You do\nhave control over how long you stay with a position, so the best you can gain from a mar-\nket trend is to be able to stay in a position for the majority of the trend. I would like to be\nable say I’m going to teach you how to stay in every market position from the early stages\nof a trend to the later stages. I can’t do that, because no matter how good your technical\nanalysis and trade management, the market will often give information that gets you in\nlate or out early. Welcome to the business of trading.\nWhat I can teach you is to recognize the market information that will help you iden-\ntify conditions that are usually present near the end of the trend so you can protect open\npositions or prepare to reverse positions. Many times you’ll have a brilliant campaign\nand maximize the possible gain from a trend from start to ﬁnish. Often you will exit well\nbefore the trend ends, and the conditions will not be ideal to reenter.\n163\n",

      "text": "164\nHIGH PROBABILITY TRADING STRATEGIES FOR ANY MARKET AND ANY TIME FRAME\nThere is an old market axiom, “You can’t go wrong taking a proﬁt.” It is absolute non-\nsense. It encourages taking a proﬁt quickly and possibly missing out on the larger time\nframe trend. Taking a proﬁt too quickly on a full position can greatly limit your potential\nreturn. After all the hard work of identifying an optimal trade and low capital exposure\nentry strategy, taking a quick proﬁt in the initial stages of a trend is not maximizing the\npotential of your position. There is nothing more aggravating than exiting a trade for a\nsmall proﬁt only to see the market continue to trend much longer and further. The ob-\njective is to understand the probable position of the trend from the information at hand\nand maintain an open position for the majority of the trend. That’s what this chapter is\nall about.\nMULTIPLE-UNIT TRADING\nMultiple-unit trading should increase your trading success signiﬁcantly. It made a big\ndifference when I incorporated it into my trade plan years ago. It’s nothing new. Suc-\ncessful traders have been using multiple-unit trade strategies as long as there has been\ntrading.\nWhat do I mean by multiple-unit trading? Every position has at least two units. A unit\nmay be just one futures contract or it could be 10 contracts. It may be 100 shares of stocks\nor it may be 1,000 shares. A unit can be any amount, but for every trade, there must be at\nleast two units. If the trade entry is successful and the market moves in the anticipated\ndirection, one unit is usually exited relatively quickly for a relatively small proﬁt. The\nsecond unit is held with the intention of capturing the longer-term trend. Whether you\nare a day trader or position trader or any time frame in between, a multiple-unit trade\nstrategy should be a key part of your trading plan.\nConcepts are important. Concepts are the basis of how we make decisions. The con-\ncept for the ﬁrst unit strategy is to assume you are incorrect about the larger time frame\ntrend and exit the unit as if the market is only making a minor correction. The idea is to\ncapture a relatively small proﬁt even if your analysis and expectations are incorrect and\na trend does not develop as anticipated. If a trend develops as anticipated, the second\nunit is held to maximize the return for the larger time frame trend. Jaime Johnson, who\nis the chief technical analyst for our DT Daily Reports for futures, stock/ETF, and Forex\nhas done several tutorials over the years about how to be dead wrong on the market po-\nsition but still end up with a proﬁt by using a two-unit trading strategy. We like to remind\ntraders over and over again that a multiple-unit trade strategy is a very important part of\nany trading plan.\nFor the examples in this chapter, all positions will be taken with two units which\nwe’ll call the short- and long-term units. You will learn the speciﬁc two-unit strategies\nwith the trade management examples. I know if you incorporate two-unit positions with\nevery trade, you will be very pleased with the results.\n",

Assume you are incorrect about the trend position and the market is only making a minor\ncorrection, not a new trend. Exit one unit once the conditions are in place to complete a\nminor correction.\n2. Maintain the second unit to take advantage if a trend develops as anticipated.\nRISK/REWARD RATIOS\nSome trading educators make a big deal about so-called risk/reward ratios and may even\nbase trading decisions on them. What do we mean by a risk/reward ratio and why is\nit basically a bogus idea? Risk/reward is supposed to compare the initial capital expo-\nsure (risk) to the potential reward (proﬁt) as a ratio. Traders are often taught to only\ntake a trade with a 3:1 risk/reward ratio. Right off the bat, we’ve got some confusing\ninformation. A 3:1 risk/reward ratio would mean there is three times the risk to the po-\ntential reward. What they really mean is a reward/risk ratio of 3:1. Okay, I’m being picky.\nBut being picky and precise with how we think about and express ideas is critical to\nsuccess.\nI’ll use the word risk for this discussion to mean the more appropriate term, initial\ncapital exposure. The dollar amount of risk for any trade can be deﬁned in advance. If\nthe entry price is $40 and the initial protective sell-stop is $35, we know the risk is $5 if\nstopped out (baring a gap through the stop price). The risk for any trade is a function of\nthe entry price less the stop price and is known before a trade is taken.\nBut what about the reward? How do we determine what is the probable reward\nfor any potential trade? We guess. That’s right. The reward part of the equation is just\na best guess of the minimum price objective we believe the market will make for the\ntrade we are considering. The potential reward is never known. I’ve seen all kinds of\nways put forth to calculate the potential reward, some logical and useful, some noth-\ning but the trader’s or educator’s excuse to come up with a number. The potential re-\nward can be based on any of a number of factors. Market structure such as typical\nE-wave price targets, prior support or resistance, the probability of a market exceed-\ning a swing high or low, and price percentage change are just a few reward targets\ntaught.\nThe potential reward estimate should be based on the same factors used to make a\ntrade decision, not on some factor not related to the same conditions used to execute the\ntrade. If you believe a market is in a position to complete a correction, the minimum ex-\npectation is the market will resume the trend direction prior to the correction and make\na new extreme beyond the high or low where the correction began. That extreme should\nbe the minimum reward for the trade. The 100% alternate price projection is another\n",

Whether a market is in a trend or countertrend, the next section\nwill often reach the 100% alternate price projection. Not always, but we assume that\nshould be the case and the 100% APP can be the reward target.\nIn every case, the reward is a best guess. Usually, it is an optimistic guess by the\ntrader to justify the trade. Some market educators make the so-called risk/reward ratio\na key trading strategy and never consider a trade unless the ratio is a minimum such as\n3:1 (reward/risk). Most professional traders don’t pay much attention to a risk/reward\nratio. They focus on identifying optimal trade setups, good trade execution, and good\ntrade management through the trade exit. If the focus is on these positive factors, closed\nproﬁtable trades will usually be several times the initial capital exposure. I don’t make\ntoo much of a risk/reward ratio because I know it is only a best guess. I suggest you don’t\nget too hung up on it yourself and avoid any trading educators who claim they teach\nyou how to only take trades with some minimum risk/reward (reward/risk) ratio. It is\na somewhat meaningless buzzword that can often hook you into expensive and often\nirrelevant trading education programs.\nIn the trade management examples in this chapter, you will see how we quickly de-\ntermine if there seems to be enough proﬁt potential in a trade to initiate the trade. You\nwill see how it is a quick and commonsense decision.\nR I S K / R E W A R D\nR A T I O\nForget about it. It’s only a best guess. Focus on positive and logical trade management and the\nrisk/reward will take care of itself. Get hung up on so-called risk/reward ratios before taking\na trade and there is a good chance you have caught the dreaded paralysis of analysis disease!\nEXIT STRATEGIES\nOnce again, concepts are important. Start with a logical concept and devise a strategy\nbased on the concept. There are four important concepts for exit strategies. The ﬁrst:\nAlways let the market take you out by moving against the position. Do not exit at a\npredetermined price target. A market will often blow right through a price target, some-\ntimes by a substantial amount. If you exit at the price target, you may miss maximizing\nthe proﬁt potential of a trade if the trend continues beyond expectations. Price targets\nor other conditions may be a reason to adjust the protective stop closer to the current\nmarket position, as you will learn in this chapter, but they are never a reason to exit the\ntrade at a speciﬁc price. What you give back by letting the market move against the posi-\ntion a small amount before exiting should be more than made up by those times a market\ntrends right through a price target.\n",

      "text": "Exit Strategies and Trade Management\n167\nI guess you should never say “never.” One situation where you might use a speciﬁc\nprice objective to exit would be if you were about to leave for vacation and would not be\nable to update your data each night to assess the current position and make decisions.\nIn that case, you will have two open orders in the market: the protective stop and the\ntake-proﬁts, exit-price order\nThe second important exit strategy concept is that the exit strategy should be based\non the same market conditions that determined the conditions to identify the trade entry\nin the ﬁrst place. If the dual time frame momentum position was a key factor to enter\na trade in the direction of the larger time frame trend, a dual time frame momentum\nposition should be a key factor in the exit strategy. The factors of momentum, pattern,\nprice, and time that are keys to identify a trade entry are the same factors used to identify\nthe exit strategy.\nThe third important concept is to determine the general exit strategy and trade\nmanagement of both units before the trade is entered. That doesn’t mean pick a target\nprice and exit the trade if the target price is reached. It does mean to identify the trade\nobjective and what conditions will require a stop-loss adjustment and exit strategy for\neach unit, before the trade is entered. Speciﬁc actions are taken if the conditions are\nmanifested.\nFourth and very important, the trade management and exit strategy may change\nas the market provides more information. As each new bar is made, whether a\nweekly or intraday time frame, new information is available. As the market struc-\nture (pattern) develops, it may provide important clues to the position of the trend\nand where a stop should be adjusted. Price targets will often be adjusted depend-\ning on the pivot highs and lows made as a trend develops. Changes will probably be\nmade to the trade management plan for any speciﬁc trade as the market provides new\ninformation.\nI wish there was one ﬁxed rule-based exit strategy that could be used with all\nmarkets, all conditions, and all time frames. There isn’t, if you want to maximize the\npotential return for any position. It is easy to make up a completely objective rule based\non price or momentum and call it an exit strategy. But no rule-based exit strategy will\nmaximize the potential reward for a trade. As I’ve stated over and over again throughout\nthis book, trading is a business like every other business. You have to gain knowledge\nand experience and constantly make decisions. You can never eliminate the decision-\nmaking process by rules, systems or any software if you want to succeed in the business,\nany more than you can eliminate the decision-making process from any other business\nand succeed.\nHowever, it is very important that any changes to the trade management and exit\nstrategies as a trade progresses are logical decisions based on the same factors that the\ntrade decision was based on in the ﬁrst place. As you will see in the comprehensive trade\ncampaign examples in this chapter and the next, each decision should be a very logical\nconclusion to the information available at the time.\n",

The trade management and exit strategy may change as the market provides more in-\nformation. Any changes should be a logical consequence of the new market informa-\ntion.\nTRADE MANAGEMENT\nTrade management is the all-inclusive term for how the trade is managed from entry to\nexit, including the entry strategy, multiple-unit position, adjusting the stop-loss on each\nunit, possibly pyramiding the position, and the exit strategy for each unit. Most of the\npreceding comments about exit strategies also pertain to trade management.\nWhenever a trade is considered, there must be a trade management plan before the\ntrade is executed. That doesn’t mean you take a lot of time to devise a different manage-\nment plan for each trade. The trade management plan should not necessarily be a list of\nspeciﬁc rules or actions taken for each trade. But it will include the guidelines for taking\naction based on the trade objective, including what action should be taken as a market\nprovides new information.\nIn a static medium like this book, it is difﬁcult to illustrate all of the relevant factors\nof a trade campaign from entry to exit with screen shots and commentary. There will\nbe quite a bit of commentary for each example in this chapter as I explain the rationale\nfor each position and trade management decision. Plus there will be several charts for\neach trade campaign to illustrate the major milestones and waypoints along the way. But\na more effective way to teach the decision-making process is to be able to advance bar\nby bar, which is exactly what I do in the CD that accompanies this book. However, as\nI’ve said repeatedly, don’t even think about watching the CD until you have ﬁnished the\nbook. The CD assumes you have read the entire book and are familiar with all the terms\nand strategies. It is a continuation of the learning material and a bar-by-bar practical\napplication of what you have learned.\nThe trade examples that follow are obviously after the fact. The most important ob-\njective is to teach you how to think in a progressive and logical manner to make decisions\nbased on the information provided by the market, bar by bar. Once you have learned\nhow to think and make logical decisions, you are prepared to trade any market, any time\n",

Any low may be the ﬁnal low of the correction.\nThe objective is to identify conditions that should result in a weekly low in order to\nposition long for a potential bull trend breakout to a new high. This would have been\nthe same strategy for about a year as the XAU made several weekly lows, followed by\nadvances lasting several weeks but never breaking away to a new high.\nAs of the last bar on the weekly chart in Figure 7.1, the XAU has tested the 50%\nretracement area of the May 2005 to May 2006 bull trend for the fourth time. Based\non the weekly cycles of the past 18 months or so, the Time Band for a weekly low is\na narrow two-week period of the WE August 10 through the WE August 17. The Time\nBand is based on the overlap of the low-low and high-low cycles, although only the low-\nlow counts are shown on the chart. I choose an eight-week momentum lookback period\nwhere the DTosc reached the OB and OS levels at the weekly highs and lows for the\npast 18 months or so. If this momentum cycle continues, the next weekly momentum\nbullish reversal should be followed by a rally lasting at least several weeks. The weekly\nmomentum is oversold. If the recent momentum rhythm continues, a momentum bullish\nreversal should be made in the next bar or two.\nSummary of XAU Weekly Position as of the Week Ending August 17\nMomentum: Oversold. A weekly momentum low is likely within the next bar or two fol-\nlowed by a rally lasting several weeks. At the least, the immediate downside should\nbe very limited before a weekly low is made.\nPattern: Corrective. The trading range is typical of a corrective or consolidation pattern\nwhich is typically followed by a rally to a new high.\nPrice: The 50% retracement area has been tested three times. The XAU is currently back\nin that range.\nTime: The WE August 10 to WE August 17 is the weekly Time Band for a low.\nTrade Strategy: Go long. With weekly momentum, pattern, price, and time all in a posi-\ntion for a low, right now, the trade strategy is to consider a long position execution\non the smaller time frame daily chart. The objective of the short-term unit is to exit\non a retracement of the prior decline in the event only a corrective rally is made.\nThe objective of the long-term unit is to hold for a probable bull trend advance to a\nnew high.\nFigure 7.2 is the XAU daily chart through Friday, August 17, which is the same date\nas the last weekly bar on the weekly chart in the previous ﬁgure.

The proper position size based on the trade capital exposure and\naccount size will risk no more than 3%. In these examples, I am not going to assume\nany particular account size. The maximum position size is an objective calculation you\nhave learned to make and nothing additional will be learned by assuming any particular\naccount size and going through the calculations for maximum position size for each trade\nexample.\nThe expectation is the XAU should eventually break up from the prolonged trading\nrange and eventually make a new high well above the July 2007 high. We don’t need to\nmake any fancy risk/reward calculations with this potential trade. If the XAU exceeds\nthe July high, the potential reward will be well over three times the risk if the order is\nexecuted above the August 17 high. You engineers with paralysis of analysis can get your\nspreadsheets out. From my point of view, there is lots of upside potential compared to\nthe minimal capital exposure and that’s all I need to know to consider the trade.\nI’m going to talk through the trade management and exit strategy and then list the\nplan. We’ve determined the XAU is in a good position to consider a long trade and the\nspeciﬁc entry strategy. Before we enter the trade, we must identify the trade objectives\nand plan the trade management strategies. The ﬁrst consideration is, what if we are dead\nwrong about a probable bull trend to a new high and the best we get is a minor corrective\nrally of the decline from the July high followed by a bear trend to a new low?\nTrade management (short-term unit): Trail the stop at the 1BL if the XAU either\nreaches the 61.8% retracement or following the second daily momentum bearish reversal.\nWhy wait for two bearish reversals? Even if the XAU is only making a corrective\nrally, corrections usually have at least three sections (ABC) which will make two mo-\nmentum bearish reversals, one at the Wave-A high and one at the Wave-C high. I used to\ntrail the stop-loss on the short-term (ST) unit after the ﬁrst smaller time frame momen-\ntum reversal against the weekly trend for a quick proﬁt, but I found the market usually\nwent higher (lower) to make a second momentum reversal even if I was wrong about\na more extended trend developing. This is the basic short-term unit exit strategy for\nmany trades.\nWhy trail the stop at the 1BL if the 61.8% correction is reached even if the daily\nmomentum has not made two bearish reversals? If the XAU is only making a corrective\nrally and not a new bull trend as anticipated, most corrections are complete by the 61.8%\nretracement so I want to be out of the ﬁrst unit around there—but only by using a Tr-1BL,\nnot exiting at the 61.8% retracement price itself.\nThe objective of the long-term (LT) unit is to maintain the position with a relatively\nwide stop in the event the XAU makes a bull trend to a new high as anticipated.\nTrade management (LT unit): If the weekly momentum reaches the overbought\nzone, the bull trend should be in the ﬁnal stages and the stop will be adjusted relatively\nclose to the current market position. We’ll deﬁne the speciﬁc exit strategy for the LT unit\nif the bull trend progresses and the market provides more information to make a speciﬁc\ndecision.\n",

The 100% APP is not shown\non the chart.\nTrade management (LT unit): The stop on the second unit is adjusted to a close at\n139.42 or below, which is the potential Wave-1 or A closing high. Should the XAU decline\nand close below the potential Wave-1 or A closing high (see August 24 horizontal line)\nfor an overlap, it would void any probable bullish pattern and be a deﬁnite reason to exit\nthe second unit.\nFigure 7.4 adds the daily data through October 9. The XAU continued in a strong\nbull trend to a new high as anticipated. On Friday, September 21, the weekly momentum\nreached the overbought zone. The September 21 date is marked on the daily chart.

The XAU upside should be relatively limited.\nA tactical decision during this period was when and to where to adjust the stop on\nthe long-term unit. From early September through September 21, the XAU did not make\nso much as a two-day correction. The daily momentum hung in the OB zone and did not\nmake a momentum cycle to a bullish reversal to give a logical place to adjust the stop, at\nleast based on the daily momentum cycles.\nTrade Management (LT Unit): Following the wide range up day on September 18,\nthe stop was adjusted to the September 5 low.\nWhy here? No ﬁrm reason except it was a bit below the 61.8% retracement as of the\nSeptember 18 high (retracement not shown on the chart) and the low of a narrow range\nday prior to another wide range up day. Few traders would keep such a wide stop on a\nposition with an open and unrealized proﬁt, but the objective is to remain in the trade\nuntil there is some market condition that suggests the bull trend is near completion.\nMost trends make at least ﬁve waves or sections, as you learned in Chapter 3. As of\nSeptember 18 only a possible Waves 1 and 2 were complete. A Wave-3 high and Wave-4\ncorrection followed by a new high should be made before the pattern conditions have\nmet the minimum structure for a trend.

The S&P is at or near a position to make an\nadvance lasting several weeks. The daily momentum made a bullish reversal Friday,\nNovember 23.\nPattern: Potential ﬁve-wave trend low. Trends frequently end with ﬁve distinct waves or\nsections. Whenever a trend has completed four waves without violating the ﬁve-wave\ntrend guidelines, the trend may be at or near its end.\nPrice: The November 21 low reached the probable Wave-5 target zone, which includes\nthe 127% and 162% Ex-Rets of Wave-4, where Wave-5 is the 100% APP of Wave-1, the\n61.8% APP of waves 1 to 3, and the 78.6% retracement of the August low to October\nhigh. This target zone includes all the typical Wave-5 targets.\nTime: The November 21 low is just two bars past the 62% time retracement of the August\nlow to October high (not shown). The potential waves 1 and 3 took seven and eight\ntrading days. The November 21 low is ﬁve trading days from the potential Wave-4\nhigh. If Nov 21 did not complete a Wave-5 low, it should be complete within the next\ntwo or three trading days.\nTrade Strategy: Go long. Weekly-daily momentum, pattern, price, and time are at or near\na position to complete a ﬁve-wave bear trend that has lasted about six weeks. If this is\nthe case, the minimum expectation is for a corrective rally to the 50% retracement at\n1501.75. The objective of the short-term unit is to exit on a retracement of the decline\nfrom the potential Wave-4 high in the event the S&P only makes a minor correction\nof the last section down. The objective of the long-term unit is to hold for a probable\n50% or more correction of the entire ﬁve-wave decline from the October high.\nLet’s go to the 60m chart of the S&P mini (ES) for the trade execution setup. Figure\n7.8 is the 60m data beginning from the November 14, probable Wave-4 high shown on\nthe previous daily chart through midday of Tuesday, November 27. On Monday, the S&P\nmade a slight new high and declined to a new low. Wave-5 itself looks like a ﬁve-wave\ndecline. The daily momentum is still bullish as of Monday’s close. Monday’s low reached\nthe lower end of the probable Wave-5 price target zone. A 60m momentum bullish re-\nversal was made as of the last 60m bar on the chart. The conditions are all in place to\nexecute a long trade on a Tr-1BH.\nEntry strategy (both units): 60m Tr-1BH.\nThe S&P may not be completing a ﬁve-wave trend from the October 11 high (see the\ndaily chart). Maybe the S&P will only make a minor corrective rally of the last section\ndown from the November 14, potential W.4 high.\nTrade management (ST unit): If the S&P reaches the 61.8% retracement at 1462 of\nthe last section down, or following the second 60m momentum bearish reversal, trail a\nstop at the 1BL.\n",

Was the\nOctober two-week correction which stopped us out of the long position really a buying\nopportunity? Based on the dual time frame momentum position we use as the ﬁrst ﬁlter\nto identify a trade setup, we did exactly the right thing. The weekly momentum made a\nbearish reversal from the OB zone, which is typically followed by a sideways to down\ntrend for several weeks, which is not a time to hold a long position.

He had ﬂown\nfrom the United Kingdom to attend a live one-day workshop I offered in Denver in Febru-\nary 2007. He was a new trader at the time and had had some trading instruction in the\nUnited Kingdom but didn’t start trading on a regular basis until the spring of 2007, fol-\nlowing the workshop in Denver.\nI think an important reason for his success is that he was new to trading and didn’t\nhave a lot of bad habits and ego to overcome when he began trading. He was the ideal\nstudent. He treated trading as a business right from the start. As you will see from the\ntwo examples I include here, he followed the high probability trading plan taught in this\nbook to a T and has found great success.\nJagir did not send any text commentary with his examples. All of the comments and\nkey information were right on the charts, which makes it easy for him to keep a record\nof his trades. I’ve recaptured the relevant charts with comments and written the text\ncommentary to describe the trade as he described it in his brief chart notes. He gave a\nfew examples with large proﬁts, but I’ve chosen to show a couple of trades with fairly\nsmall proﬁts where a less experienced trader may have had losses, given the market\nreversals made during the trades. Jagir made at least small proﬁts on these trades by\napplying good trading strategies and good trade management.\nGBP/USD Short Trade Setup\nWeekly and daily momentum overbought\nPossible ABC corrective high\nAs of September 24, 2007, the British pound (GBP) weekly momentum had turned\nbearish and the daily momentum was overbought. The GBP had poked above the 78.6%\nretracement for a possible ABC corrective high. The Time Band for a high was September\n26 to October 1, but the high-high band began on September 21. The higher time frame\nweekly and daily positions were ideal for a possible ABC high and a short trade setup.\n(See Figure 8.5.)\nTrade Execution\nThe 60m chart shows the possible ABC count into the September\n24 high. Jagir showed that the Wave-C had probably subdivided into ﬁve waves. Jagir’s\nchart showed several price targets clustered around the September 24 high, including a\n78.6% retracement, 100% APP of Wave-A, 162% Ext-Ret of Wave-C, and more. I’ve only\nshown the 162% Ext Ret on the 60m chart to keep the chart from being cluttered. (See\nFigure 8.6.)\nTrade Management\nOnce the 60m DTosc made a bearish reversal, Jagir trailed a\nstop to go short two units at the 60m trailing 1BL. The short position was executed at\n2.0254 and the initial protective buy-stop was one tick above the September 24 high at\n2.0322. The objective to cover half of the position (one unit) was at the minor 50% re-\ntracement at 2.0200.\n",

The maximum price targets around 997 to 1038 (gold continuous data) were both\n100% alternate price projections of the range of waves 1 to 3, projected from a Wave-4\nlow for the Wave-5 of 5 shown on the daily chart and the higher time frame wave (5)\nshown on the monthly chart. The 100% APP of the range of waves 1 to 3 is typically the\nmaximum target for a Wave-5.\nThis example is being included in the book in early March, 2008. Gold has reached\n$995, the beginning of the maximum price targets Cees predicted weeks earlier. Accord-\ning to Cees’s time projections, gold should complete a ﬁnal top by mid-March. At the\nleast, according to Cees’s charts and comments, we should be in the ﬁnal phase of the\ngold bull trend. Readers can check their gold data to see how it worked out.\nAdditional Follow-up\nAs I make the ﬁnal proof for this chapter for the book in late May 2008, I though it would\nbe instructive for a ﬁnal follow-up. Gold made a top March 17 at 1038.6 (continuous\ncontract data). Cees’s latest time target to complete a major high was March 15. The\nactual gold high was made March 17 with the daily closing high made March 14. Cees\nprojected the maximum price target probable at 1038. The actual high on March 17 was\n1038.6! Talk about a dead-center hit time and price target bulls-eye. Cees didn’t use any\nsecret strategies not taught in this book. If this doesn’t convince you the strategies taught\nin this book will be valuable to you, close your account and get a job.\nKERRY SZYMANSKI (TUCSON, ARIZONA)\nLong S&P Swing Trade\nHigher time frame: Daily\nLower time frame: 60m\nKerry has traded stocks and futures for over 10 years, beginning when he was still work-\ning as a real estate broker and investor.

Notice that the Wave-3\nappears to have clearly subdivided into ﬁve waves.

Derrik had been a longtime Dynamic Trader software\nowner and subscriber to the DT Reports. Derrik later published his own trading book,\nFibonacci for the Active Trader (TradingMarkets Publishing Group, 2004).\nDerrik trades for his own account and advises on risk management and hedging\nstrategies for farmers. I’ve re-created the charts he sent to me. The trade description and\ncommentary are all his except my comments in parenthesis italics and in the “Robert’s\nComments” and “Robert’s Follow-Up” sections.\nThe Setup for Long Soybean Trade: Possible ABC at Price\nand Momentum Support\nIn addition to my own trading, I work with many farming operations to develop risk\nmanagement strategies and assist with hedging decisions for their crops. My analysis and\nrecommendations are centered around the Dynamic Trading high probability strategies.\nMy analysis considers ﬁve areas:\n1. Wave analysis.\n2. Two standard deviation regression channels.\n3. Fibonacci price zones (where multiple extensions and retracement levels converge\nto form a support or resistance zone).\n4. Candlestick charts.\n5. DT Oscillator for momentum.\nIn the middle of April 2007, the November soybean contract was in the midst of a\nsigniﬁcant decline after spending much of the winter in a strong uptrend. Many produc-\ners/farmers began to get concerned that the ride was over, and fear was beginning to set\nin. I was receiving daily phone calls regarding the idea of just “. . . taking our proﬁts and\ngetting out before it gets real ugly.”\nAfter running my analysis, it was clear to me we were probably in a classic three-\nwave correction (A,B,C). I am especially partial to these corrections when Wave-C lands\non the bottom of my uptrending regression channel. It looked like that may be the case\nwith November 2007 soybeans as of mid-April. I also found a large number of Fibonacci\nprice retracements and extensions that came together between $7.60 and $7.30. These\nsupport zones were right on the bottom of the regression channel. (See Figure 8.20.)\nRobert’s Comments\nI’ve only included some of the key price projections Derrik\nprovided on this chart, including the 61.8% and 78.6% internal retracements, 127% and\n162% external retracements and the 100% alternate price projection of Wave-A from the\nWave-B high. The most probable Wave-C target should be around 7.60, which includes\none projection from each set, including the 61.8% internal retracement and 100% alternate\nprice projection.\n",

Regression chan-\nnels are a key factor in Derrik’s decision-making process, and you will see how well they\nmay be included with the strategies taught in this book.\nTrade Entry\nIn speaking with my farmers, I communicated that I would not be selling at these levels,\nbut that I would be looking for an opportunity to buy and, in a farmer’s case, simply\nhold off on any kind of hedging decisions. To conﬁrm my analysis, I was looking for\na DT Oscillator momentum bullish reversal.

Derrik uses mar-\nket structure to make stop adjustments. What does he mean by market structure? He\nmakes logical decisions based on the market activity including following gaps, minor\nswing lows, and consolidation breakouts. You can never know in advance what the mar-\nket structure will be, so the speciﬁc trade management strategy may be changed as the\ntrade progresses. A part of the trade management plan that is very objective is to take off\npart of the position at the regression median line and another part at the extreme of the\nregression channel.\nDerrik was very candid that this was an ideal, trend trade where everything worked\nout nicely, but he often gets stopped out with less trending and more volatile and choppy\nmarkets for small proﬁts or small losses. His objective is to be in and stay in a trade when\na market makes a major trend.

They throw out all the\nrules of success and believe they can quickly and easily learn to trade and it will be the\npath to riches. Trading takes time to learn and master like any other business. You must\ngain the knowledge and experience, develop a trading plan, test, evaluate and review to\nconstantly improve, just like any other business.

If you’re a position trader making decisions based on\nmonthly, weekly, and daily data, you should only have to spend 30 minutes or so each\nevening scanning the data and charts for potential setups, or a bit more time if you are a\nstock/ETF trader and following a lot of markets.\nWhatever time frame you trade, the routine is the same. The day begins with a list\nof markets that are at or near the initial trade conditions. Once the initial conditions are\nmet, entry orders are placed. If a trade is executed and you’re not stopped out at the\ninitial stop, the trade is monitored according to your trade plan and stop-loss decisions\nare made as the trade progresses. The routine is the same regardless of whether you are\nday-trading off 15- and 5-minute bars or position-trading off weekly and daily bars.\nA very important key routine, even if you are a day trader, is to do most of your anal-\nysis and preliminary decision making outside of market hours. There are few decisions\nthat a swing or position trader makes on a daily basis for any one market because there\nis not that much new information each day for trades lasting a few days to a few weeks.\nBut even day traders should start the day with a plan by identifying which markets have\nthe best potential for trade setups that day.\nEvery consistently successful trader keeps records of all trades with at least brief\nnotes of why the trade was considered, how it was executed, and the trade management\nplan. The record keeping may be as brief or as detailed as suits you, but you must track\nyour trade activities. The monthly brokerage statement of trades is not enough. This\nstatement only lists trades but doesn’t provide any information about why and how you\ngot in and out.\nI used to keep a very detailed journal with a form I made up in Excel to list all the\ndetails of the market conditions for considering the trade, the entry strategy, and how the\ntrade was managed, including notes on every stop-loss adjustment. Each form included\na copy of the chart when the trade was entered and at least one additional chart with\ndata through the trade exit. This journal has evolved to a simpler format, partly because\nmy trade plan and the information I need to make a trading decision has become much\nsimpler over the years.\nMy trade plan has evolved from very detailed and complex Gann, Elliott, chart geom-\netry, time, and price strategies to much more simple strategies as outlined in this book.\nToday, I make notes right on the chart and print a copy when a trade is made. I may make\nadditional handwritten notes right on the chart printout. If I’m not stopped out at the ini-\ntial protective stop, I may make another one or two chart prints as the trade progresses,\nto note signiﬁcant decision-making periods. I put the charts with notes in a three-ring\nbinder and have a complete log to review each trade.\nIt is fast and easy to record trades this way. Fast and easy means it will get done, and\nall of the relevant information is recorded. Detailed and complex means it probably won’t\nget done on a regular basis. I strongly suggest you develop a trade recording process that\nsuits your temperament. By that I mean one that you will do in a timely manner on a\nconsistent basis that includes all the relevant information needed to review the trade at\na later date.\n",

You have\nlearned how to identify time, price, pattern, and momentum conditions to adjust stops\nto manage the trade through the exit. As a trade progresses, you will have to make deci-\nsions, but the decisions should be made in the context of the market position, not some\narbitrary fear or greed factor that is not related to the original reasons the trade was\nmade.\nSome readers will be asking, “Why don’t you just give us a trade plan?” There are a\ncouple of reasons. First, you probably wouldn’t follow it. You would second-guess the\nobjective rules and make unwarranted assumptions when decisions needed to be made.\nIt is very difﬁcult to follow someone else’s plan. A few years ago, I trained for and\nparticipated in several adventure races over a two-year period. The adventure races were\nmostly nonstop 24 hours and included mountain biking, trail hiking/running, kayaking,\nrappelling, and land navigation. They were brutal. I read several books on endurance\ntraining and understood the key training principles. I hired an endurance trainer over\nseveral months to make a training plan for each day to work on developing my biking\nand running endurance. Each weekend I received an e-mail with the next week’s training\nplan. Did I follow the plan exactly every day? No. The plan was a good guideline of what\nto work on, but many days I varied the plan to suit my current condition. The training\nplan kept me focused. I worked within the principles of the plan but some days made\nvariations depending on how I felt that day. The trainer’s plan was a key to improving\nmy performance, but I think I progressed more or at least kept more motivated and in-\nterested in the training by making some changes. In other words, I used the trainers plan\nas a guide to develop my own plan. It is very difﬁcult to follow another person’s plan.\nSecond, you may want to begin with a more rigid and objective plan than a plan I\nwould suggest. A more objective plan may result in fewer setups that meet your more\nobjective rules and guidelines but may also result in a higher rate of successful trades.\nThis is usually the trade-off with more rules: Fewer trades are entered, but often the\nfewer number of trades have a higher rate of success. As you gain more experience, you\nmay broaden the rules and guidelines to allow you to apply your added knowledge to the\ndecision-making process.\nPrior chapters have given you all the information you need to develop a trade plan\nand make decisions when necessary. Let’s review the major elements of every trade plan\nto guide you to making your own speciﬁc plan.\nKey Trade Plan Elements\n1. Objective minimum trade setup conditions. What are the objective minimum condi-\ntions that must be met to consider a trade? I believe the dual time frame momentum\nsetups you learned in this book are the best objective conditions to identify poten-\ntial trades that should be a part of your trade plan. The key is that the dual time\nframe setups are logical and objective. They work. The dual time frame momentum\nconditions are the best trade ﬁlter I’ve discovered in over 20 years.\n",

Has the market reached a typical price and/or time target for a correction\nor trend reversal to be made? There are decisions to be made, but the decisions are\nwithin very narrow guidelines, as you have learned in previous chapters.\n3. Objective entry strategy. I have a very ﬁrm belief that once the conditions for a\ntrade setup have been made, the entry strategy should be objective. In other words,\nthere are no more decisions to be made as to how and at what price to execute\nthe trade and place the initial protective stop. You have learned two objective entry\nstrategies in this book, the momentum reversal and the swing breakout. They are all\nyou need.\n4. Trade management/exit strategy. How are you going to manage the trade through\nthe exit? Here is where most of your trade decisions will be made. You could make\nthis part of your plan highly objective, such as trail the stop on one unit at the trailing\n1BL/H following the ﬁrst smaller time frame momentum reversal against the larger\ntime frame trend. Or trail the stop on one unit if the market reaches the 100% alter-\nnate price projection. These would be objective exit strategies that will serve you\nwell.\nHowever, to maximize your knowledge and experience, you should consider the\nprice, time, and pattern position as part of your trade management strategy. This is\nwhere decisions will have to be made depending on speciﬁc conditions as a mar-\nket progresses. You have learned from the trade examples in prior chapters, includ-\ning those of the traders featured in Chapter 8, that the trade management plan may\nchange as a trend progresses and a market provides new information.\nA very important part of trade management is to always trade at least two units,\nexiting one unit on short-term conditions and holding a second unit for higher time\nframe conditions. Consider an objective exit strategy for the short-term unit, and\na strategy based on decisions made according to the market position as the trade\nprogresses for the larger time frame unit.\nThese are the four elements to any trade plan. In the trade examples in previous\nchapters, you have learned all you need to know to develop your own trade plan and\nmake decisions based on these four elements. The CD examples will demonstrate more\ntrades from entry to exit based on a trade plan following these four principles.\nDon’t be fooled into believing that you can buy success, that you can follow another\nperson’s trade plan step-by-step, or buy a trade system and be successful. You will only\nbe successful if you gain the knowledge and experience and develop your own trade plan\nthat includes these four elements just described.\nEvery successful trader has a written trade plan. Most unsuccessful traders do not.\n",

      "text": "The Business of Trading and Other Matters\n243\nRead this very carefully: If you can’t make money with unleveraged trades, you’ll\nnever make money with leveraged trades. If you are not a consistently proﬁtable trader\nin your leveraged futures, Forex, or stock account, why not learn to trade with unlever-\naged markets where the cost to gain the experience and to develop a trading plan should\nbe very minimal? There are ETFs and mutual funds that track most of the major ﬁnan-\ncial markets, including all the major stock indexes, bonds, gold and currencies, and even\nsome commodities. You can take small positions as you gain experience and develop a\ntrading plan. Once you develop a plan and gain experience and become proﬁtable with\nthe unleveraged trades, you can then apply your knowledge, experience, and trading plan\nto leveraged futures, Forex, and margined stocks.\nYou don’t have to have a large account or take large risks to learn how to trade\nand develop a trading plan. It’s true, you are not going to make a lot of money with a\nsmall account and unleveraged trades. You are also not going to lose a lot as you learn.\nThe learning process can be costly with leveraged trades. Until you have developed a\nconsistently successful trading plan that is proﬁtable on a regular basis, your objective is\nnot to make money but to learn to trade. That may sound odd, saying that your objective\nis not to make money, but that’s the way it is. Once you have learned to trade, the money\nfollows. There is absolutely no reason to take big risks until you have learned to trade\nsuccessfully.\nAre you interested in trading futures stock indexes like the ES Mini (S&P mini fu-\ntures contract)? Trade the SPY ETF until you are consistently proﬁtable, and then move\non to the leveraged futures contract. Want to trade Forex? Forget 100:1 leverage until\nyou have learned how to trade. Most of the major currency pairs have an ETF you can\ntrade until you have learned how to trade successfully. If you can’t make money trad-\ning unleveraged, you will never make money trading leveraged. It is that simple. This\nis a clear distinction between someone who is serious about learning how to trade and\nsomeone who thinks trading is a get rich quick activity.\nI realize that day-trading has become very appealing in recent years, with all the new\ninexpensive technology: Get in and out quickly. Take your proﬁt or loss quickly. Don’t\nhold a position overnight. Minimize your exposure. It sounds enticing, but I believe the\nodds of being successful are stacked much higher against the day trader than the swing or\nposition trader, at least until you have learned to trade. Something alters your discipline,\nbeliefs, organization, and decision-making ability when you are watching a screen all day\nwith the intraday bars building tick by tick. It is extremely difﬁcult to remain disciplined,\nstick to a trading plan, and make logical, sound decisions with very short-term day trades.\nI strongly encourage traders who are interested in day-trading to ﬁrst develop a trad-\ning plan and experience with swing and position trading, preferably with unleveraged\ntrades, before attempting to day-trade.\nIf you can’t make money with unleveraged intermediate-term trades using weekly\nand daily data, you are going to get cleaned out fast making short-term trades\nwith highly leveraged markets.\n",

      "text": "244\nTRADING THE PLAN\nTRADE FOR POINTS, NOT FOR TICKS\nOne of the big drawbacks to day-trading is the proﬁt potential is limited. Day traders trade\nfor ticks, not for points. There is only so much movement in one day which means there\nis only so much proﬁt potential. To make enough money to cover your trading expenses\n(software, data, education, etc.) by day-trading, you have to trade size. It is hardly worth\nyour time and expense day-trading just two or three futures contracts, even if you have\na very high win rate.\nI believe day-trading provides the least return for your time and investment of any\ntime frame of trading. At the least, even if you are a successful day trader, also consider\nlonger-term positions that last from a few days to a few weeks to capture the longer-term\ntrends with a potential for greater rewards. Put your knowledge and experience to work\nfor greater proﬁt potential. W. D. Gann taught, “The big money is made in the big trends.”\nNew traders should consider this truth carefully. Trade for points, not for ticks.\nYOU CAN’T BUY SUCCESS\nSometimes I’m almost ashamed to be associated with the business of educating traders\nand developing trading software because the business is rife with outright scammers\nmaking promises and insinuating you can quickly and easily learn to get rich fast trading.\nYou’ve seen the ads: Learn the “secrets” of Wall Street or the professional traders, and\nmake a killing. You’ve seen the charts in ads with the little buy and sell arrows where\nevery trade is a big proﬁt; or the ads that claim hundreds of percent return if only you\nfollow their system or subscribe to their advisory report; or the trading software (usually\nvery expensive) that will supposedly give you the buy and sell signals for consistently\nproﬁtable results. If you subscribe to any trading publication or surf some of the trading\nsites on the Web, I know you’ve seen a lot of these outlandish promises. You’ve probably\ntaken the bait on a few of them and spent a lot of money with little or no results. You’re\nnot the only one. I’ve been a sucker myself, especially in the early years. I guess it’s part of\nthe learning process we all go through when we’re learning something new and actually\nthink there are some secrets we can quickly learn to put us on the road to riches.\nBeware of any promoter making unrealistic claims. It’s just common sense, which\nunfortunately our fear and greed drives out of our consciousness now and then. There\nare a lot of good trading educators. Some have been around for years and have a lot\nof experience trading and teaching traders. The legitimate trading educators never make\nunrealistic claims. In fact, I don’t believe I’ve ever seen an ad or promotion by a legitimate\ntrading educator that make a results-based claim. They know the best they can do is\nteach you whatever they have become good at. How and if you apply the knowledge is\nup to you.\nThe more knowledge and experience you gain, the quicker you will be able to discern\nwhat should be legitimate and useful information as opposed to having your chain pulled.\n",

You’ve read the\nstatistics from many sources about how a very high percentage of traders drop out or go\nbust after just a few months. But you do not have to be one of them.\nIf you apply yourself to learn to trade, you can be successful. Go about it in a busi-\nnesslike manner.

Both sections include the same deﬁnitions.\nGLOSSARY—ALPHABETICALLY\nABC (simple) correction\nA frequent correction pattern of three swings where the third\nswing (Wave-C) exceeds the extreme of the ﬁrst swing (Wave-A). Also called a zigzag. A\nthree-swing correction may also be an irregular ABC where the Wave-C does not exceed\nthe extreme of the Wave-A. The time and price targets to complete a three-section ABC\ncorrection are very predictive. The assumption is always that a correction will make at\nleast three sections.\nalternate price projection (APP)\nCompares the price range of swings in the same direc-\ntion. The most frequently used percentage alternate price projections are 62 percent,\n100 percent, and 162 percent. Sometimes called price extensions by other authors and\nin some software programs. The principle is that the price range of a section is of-\nten one of the key APP ratios of recent sections. An APP is made from three pivot\npoints. The price range between two pivots is measured and projected from a third\npivot.\nalternate time projection (ATP)\nCompares the time range of swings in the same direc-\ntion. The most frequently used percentage alternate time projections are 62 percent,\n100 percent, and 162 percent. The principle is that the time range of a section is of-\nten one of the key ATP ratios of recent sections. An ATP is made from three pivot\npoints. The time range between two pivots is measured and projected from a third\npivot.\nbear, momentum\nWhen a momentum indicator is negative. In a two-line indicator, the\nfast line is below the slow line. A basic part of the high probability strategy is to trade in\nthe direction of the momentum. Only short trades would be considered if the momentum\nis bearish unless the momentum is bear OS.\nbear OS, momentum\nWhen an indicator is bearish and has reached the oversold (OS)\nzone. With a two-line indicator, the fast line is below the slow line and both lines\nhave reached the oversold zone. In most cases, bear OS momentum warns that\nthe downside should be limited before a momentum low and probable price low is\nmade.\n249\n",

A momentum\nbullish reversal is often a setup for a long trade or to exit a short trade.\ncapital exposure\nThe amount of capital (money) that may be lost if a trade moves against\nthe initial position. In other words, the potential cost to ﬁnd out if the trade decision\nwill be proﬁtable or not. Often called risk. The initial capital exposure per unit is the\ndifference between the entry price and the initial protective stop price.\ncomplex correction\nAny correction with more than three sections (waves). The form of\na complex correction cannot be predicted in advance. The time and price targets for a\ncomplex correction are not as easily identiﬁed in advance as for a simple ABC correction.\ncountertrend\nA correction against the main trend. The assumption is always that a cor-\nrection will make at least three sections. An important part of a trading plan is to identify\nthe possible end of a correction in order to place a trade in the direction of the trend.\nday trader\nA very short-term trader who is usually glued to the monitor during market\nhours and enters and exits a trade during one trading day. The odds of success are very\nsmall unless the day trader has ﬁrst perfected a consistently proﬁtable trading plan for\nswing or position trades.\nDual Time Frame Momentum Strategy\nSee Multiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy.\ndynamic ratios\nA series of geometric and harmonic ratios used for Dynamic Time and\nPrice Strategies, including .382, .50, .618, .786, 1.00, 1.272, 1.618, and 2.618. The unique-\nness of the Dynamic Time and Price Strategies as taught in this book is that different\nratios are used for time or price analysis. Plus the ratios are applied in unique ways de-\npending on whether the market is making a trend or a correction.\nE-wave\nElliott wave pattern analysis. See Elliott wave.\nElliott wave (E-wave)\nPattern analysis approach developed by R. N. Elliott. The idea is that\ntrends and corrections are usually made in a limited number of patterns that conform to\nrules and guidelines that help distinguish if the section is part of a trend or correction.\nOne of the most important values of Elliott wave pattern analysis is to help recognize if a\nmarket is in a position to complete a trend or correction. Trends are usually made in ﬁve\ndistinct sections. Corrections should be at least three sections but may evolve into much\nmore complex structures.\n",

In this book, the EOW targets for a simple ABC and a ﬁve-wave trend are\ntaught.\nentry strategy\nThe strategy to determine the entry conditions and speciﬁc entry and ini-\ntial stop-loss prices. The entry strategies recommended in this book are completely ob-\njective once the trade conditions have been met. The two recommended entry strate-\ngies in this book are the momentum reversal trailing one-bar-high (low) and the swing\nbreakout.\nexit strategy\nThe conditions to exit an open trade. The exit strategy must be determined\nbefore the trade is entered. The exit strategy may be completely objective, such as trailing\nthe stop at the one-bar-high/low following a momentum reversal. Or the exit strategy\nmay be more subjective and adjusted as a market progresses. Even if the exit strategy is\nmore subjective, the objective of the trade and general conditions to consider exiting the\ntrade should be deﬁned in advance. See trade examples in Chapters 7 and 8 for how exit\nstrategies are adjusted as a market progresses and provides new information.\nFibonnacci (Fib) ratios\nSee dynamic ratios.\nimpulse trend\nAn Elliott wave term for a ﬁve-section trend. Since many trends are com-\nplete with ﬁve waves, the trader should always be alert for the end of a trend if a market\nis making a ﬁfth wave.\nlookback period\nThe number of bars an indicator looks back to calculate the current indi-\ncator value. A relatively short lookback period will result in an indicator being relatively\nsensitive to recent price volatility and trends. A relatively long lookback period will result\nin the indicator being relatively slow to change.\nmomentum indicator\nMost price-based indicators are also called momentum indicators.\nIn most cases, the momentum indicator represents the rate-of-change over the lookback\nperiod. The rate-of-change may reﬂect whether the trend of the market is speeding up\nor slowing down compared with prior trends. Momentum does not always trend in the\nsame direction as the price trend.\nmomentum reversal trailing one-bar-high/low entry strategy\nFollowing a smaller time frame\nmomentum reversal in the direction of the larger time frame momentum, the entry price\nis trailed one tick above/below the last completed bar. The entry price is adjusted with\neach new bar if the trade has not been executed, as long as the smaller time frame mo-\nmentum has not made another reversal in the opposite direction. If the trade entry order\nis executed, the initial protective stop is placed one tick below/above the swing low/high\nmade prior to entry. The principle is that the trade is only entered if the market takes out\na bar high or low in the direction of the trade.\nMultiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy\nA strategy to place trades only when at least two\ntime frames of momentum are in the same direction, such as weekly and daily or daily\nand 60m. The basic strategy is to trade in the direction of the larger time frame and exe-\ncute the trade following a smaller time frame momentum reversal in the direction of the\nlarger time frame momentum. Can use more than two time frames of momentum. (See\nDual Time Frame Momentum Strategy Rules in text for bull OB and bear OS exceptions.)\n",

Warns that the\nlarger time frame trend may be reversing for either a higher time frame correction or a\nnew trend in the opposite direction.\noverbought (OB)\nAn indicator level, usually expressed as a percentage of the minimum\nto maximum range of possible indicator values, that represents when an indicator is at a\nrelatively high level, usually around 70 to 80 percent. For many indicators, if they reach\nan overbought level, the upside in price should be limited before a price high is made.\noverlap guideline\nIf a market trades back into the range of the previous section, it has\noverlapped that section. This important guideline warns that the market should be mak-\ning a correction and not a new trend.\noversold (OS)\nAn indicator level, usually expressed as a percentage of the minimum to\nmaximum range of possible indicator values, that represents when an indicator is at a\nrelatively low level, usually around 20 to 30 percent. For many indicators, if they reach\nan oversold level, the downside in price should be limited before a price low is made.\nposition size\nThe number of trading units (contracts, shares, lots) for the trade. The\nmaximum position size should represent capital exposure of no more than 3 percent\nof the account. (See Chapter 6 for how to calculate maximum position size.)\nposition trader\nTrades longer-term trends lasting from several days to several weeks.\nTrades for points, not for ticks.

A relatively short lookback period will result in an indicator being relatively\nsensitive to recent price volatility and trends. A relatively long lookback period will result\nin the indicator being relatively slow to change.\nMultiple Time Frame Momentum Strategy\nA strategy to place trades only when at least\ntwo time frames of momentum are in the same direction, such as weekly and daily, or\ndaily and 60-minute. The basic strategy is to trade in the direction of the larger time\nframe and execute the trade following a smaller time frame momentum reversal in the\ndirection of the larger time frame momentum. Can use more than two time frames of\nmomentum. (See Dual Time Frame Momentum Strategy Rules in text for bull OB and\nbear OS exceptions.)\nmomentum indicator\nMost price-based indicators are also called momentum indicators.\nIn most cases, the momentum indicator represents the rate-of-change over the lookback\nperiod. The rate-of-change may reﬂect whether the trend of the market is speeding up\nor slowing down compared with prior trends. Momentum does not always trend in the\nsame direction as the price trend.\noscillator indicators\nUsually used interchangeably with momentum indicator.\noverbought (OB)\nAn indicator level, usually expressed as a percentage of the minimum\nto maximum range of possible indicator values, that represents when an indicator is\nat a relatively high level, usually around 70 to 80 percent.

Also called a zigzag. A\nthree-swing correction may also be an irregular ABC where the Wave-C does not exceed\nthe extreme of the Wave-A.

The assumption is always that a correction will make at\nleast three sections.\ncomplex correction\nAny correction with more than three sections (waves). The form\nof a complex correction cannot be predicted in advance. The time and price targets\nfor a complex correction are not as easily identiﬁed in advance as for a simple ABC\ncorrection.\ncountertrend\nA correction against the main trend. The assumption is always that a cor-\nrection will make at least three sections. An important part of a trading plan is to iden-\ntify the possible end of a correction in order to place a trade in the direction of the\ntrend.\nE-wave\nElliott wave pattern analysis. See Elliott wave.\nElliott wave (E-wave)\nPattern analysis approach developed by R. N. Elliott. The idea is that\ntrends and corrections are usually made in a limited number of patterns that conform to\nrules and guidelines that help distinguish if the section is part of a trend or correction.\nOne of the most important values of Elliott wave pattern analysis is to help recognize if a\nmarket is in a position to complete a trend or correction. Trends are usually made in ﬁve\ndistinct sections. Corrections should be at least three sections but may evolve into much\nmore complex structures.\nimpulse trend\nAn Elliott wave term for a ﬁve-section trend. Since many trends are com-\nplete with ﬁve waves, the trader should always be alert for the end of a trend if a market\nis making a ﬁfth wave.\noverlap guideline\nIf a market trades back into the range of the last section, it has over-\nlapped that section. This is a important guideline that warns the market should be making\na correction and not a new trend.\ntrend\nThe main price direction. The side of the market you want to trade. Trends are\noften complete in ﬁve sections, also called an Elliott wave impulse trend.\n",

If the recent time cycle rhythm continues, the assumption is that\nthe next high will be made in the Time Band (overlap) range. Outliers may be eliminated\nwhen measuring the L-L or L-H ranges. In a bear trend, the Time Band is the overlap of\nthe recent low-low and high-low time ranges.\ntime retracement (TR)\nCompares the time range of a corrective section to the prior trend\nsection. The most frequently used TR ratios are 38.2 percent, 50 percent, 61.8 percent,\n100 percent, and 162 percent.

The entry price is adjusted with\neach new bar if the trade has not been executed, as long as the smaller time frame mo-\nmentum has not made another reversal in the opposite direction. If the trade entry order\nis executed, the initial protective stop is placed one tick below/above the swing low/high\nmade prior to entry. The principle is that the trade is only entered if the market takes out\na bar high or low in the direction of the trade.\nposition size\nThe number of trading units (contracts, shares, lots) for the trade. The\nmaximum position size should represent capital exposure of no more than 3 percent\nof the account. (See Chapter 6 for how to calculate maximum position size.)\nswing breakout entry strategy\nOnce the conditions for a trade are made, initiate a go-long\nor go-short entry at a price one tick above/below the recent swing high or low. Place\nthe initial protective stop-loss one tick below/above the swing high or low made prior to\nentry. The principle is that the conditions for a reversal or trend continuation have been\nmet and the trade is entered as the market moves above/below a swing high or low in the\nanticipated trend direction.\ntrailing one-bar-high/low\nOnce the conditions for entry have been met, including the\nsmaller time frame momentum reversal, a go-long or go-short entry is trailed one tick\nabove/below the high/low of the previous bar.

The exit strategy may be completely objective, such as trailing\nthe stop at the one-bar-high/low following a momentum reversal. Or the exit strategy\nmay be more subjective and adjusted as a market progresses. Even if the exit strategy is\nmore subjective, the objective of the trade and general conditions to consider exiting the\ntrade should be deﬁned in advance. See trade examples in Chapters 7 and 8 for how exit\nstrategies are adjusted as a market progresses and provides new information.\nmultiple-unit trading\nEvery trade should be taken with at least two units. The exit strategy\nis different for each unit. One unit is considered short-term and is exited if the market\nreaches a minor corrective target. The second unit is considered long-term and is exited\nat a trend target. A multiple-unit trade plan should increase net proﬁtability over time.\nrisk/reward\nThe amount of money at risk versus the potential reward. Usually shown as\na ratio such as 3:1, which is really the reward to risk or $3 potential proﬁt for $1 risk\n(capital exposure). The risk per unit can be deﬁned as the difference between the entry\nprice and the initial protective stop price. The reward is always just a best guess of the\nprobable minimum move the market is likely to make.\ntrade management\nThe general term for how each trade is managed from entry to exit.\ntrade plan\nThe plan as to how the business of trading will be conducted, including con-\nditions for entry, entry to exit strategies, maximum capital exposure, and trade manage-\nment.

Also called mechanical trading. “You can’t buy success.” To my\nknowledge, no trading system has been sold that has been consistently proﬁtable in real-\ntime trading over time. Instead of buying a system, give the system cost and your trading\naccount to the charity of your choice.
