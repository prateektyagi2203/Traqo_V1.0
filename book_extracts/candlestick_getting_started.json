      "text": "Preface\nI\nf the markets moved in a logical fashion, anyone could learn a few basics\nand make money trading. But that is not the case. It is the emotional crowd\nthat moves markets. Traders’ and investors’ greed and fear, imprinted on\ncharts, are like a road map to the markets. Those who learn to read and deci-\npher the underlying messages of that price movement can gain a much-needed\nedge in a competitive environment.\nThat’s where Getting Started in Candlestick Charting comes in. This book\nwill provide you with a solid foundation from which to begin using candlestick\ncharts. You’ll learn to recognize candlestick reversal patterns and embed them\nin your mind through an understanding of how they reﬂect the messages of\ncrowd sentiment. Candlesticks will help you gauge the strength of price moves\nand spot potential reversals early, before the crowd reacts.\nIf you have steered clear of candlestick charting until now because it\nseems like there is a mind-numbing number of patterns to learn, you can put\nthat concern to rest. It is not necessary to learn dozens of candlestick patterns.\nThis book narrows the focus to several commonly formed candlestick reversal\npatterns that you can learn to recognize in short order. You can start right away\nutilizing candlesticks to improve your chart analysis skills, and, of course, to in-\ncrease your proﬁtability.\nYou will ﬁnd this book very helpful if you desire to:\n• Learn candlestick charting but don’t want to get overwhelmed. \n• Learn to recognize high probability trade setups.\n• Improve your swing trading techniques. Candlestick charting is a stel-\nlar tool for ﬁne-tuning swing trading strategies.\n• Learn how to improve the timing of your entries and exits.\n• Develop a knowledge base in classic Western technical analysis and un-\nderstand the role of candlesticks within that broader framework.\nEvery effort was made to produce this important learning resource in a\nuser-friendly format. The chapters are organized in a manner in which they build\none upon the other. The content is written in layman’s terms with a level of\ndetail that ensures understanding by beginning and intermediate-level traders.\nvii\n",

      "text": "I make no apologies for deﬁning technical terms and describing concepts that\nadvanced level chartists might consider to be familiar territory. However, even\nadvanced chartists who choose this book with the intent of adding candlesticks\nto their technical skill set will ﬁnd that it suits their purpose. Since a picture is\nworth a thousand words, there are numerous illustrations and real-world chart-\ning examples included throughout the chapters. Through careful dissection of\nthe charts, and the commentary and analysis included with them, you’ll already\nbe recognizing the key Japanese candlestick patterns and Western technical\nevents before you ﬁnish the last page of this book.\nIn Part I of the book you’ll learn about candlestick charting.  Chapter 2\ndemonstrates how the candlestick lines are constructed.  In Chapter 3 you’ll be\nintroduced to several common candlestick reversal patterns.  You’ll learn their\ndeﬁnitions and the psychology behind each formation.  The patterns are well il-\nlustrated to help you train your eye to recognize them when analyzing charts.  A\nsummary of the candlestick patterns presented is included in Appendix A.\nOnce you have thoroughly studied the details of each pattern in Chapter 3, use\nthis guide for quick reference until you are so familiar with the patterns that\nyou no longer need it.  Chapter 4 will solidify your understanding of how the\nreversal patterns are formed and factors that may impact their signals.  Chapter\n5 wraps up Part I with a discussion of “tails” and how their presence sends a\nmessage about the current market sentiment.\nPart II of the book shows you how to put candlestick charting to work.\nYou’ll learn how to blend Eastern candlestick charting with classic Western\ntechnical analysis. Candlesticks are not a complete trading system. In order to\nrecognize their full potential you must understand how they ﬁt into the broader\npicture. It is crucial to realize the important roles played by volume, volatility,\ntrends, gaps, support, and resistance. These topics are covered in Chapters 6\nthrough 9. If you are new to chart analysis in general, you’ll ﬁnd these chapters\nto be invaluable. Even if you are already well versed in Western technical analy-\nsis, you’ll learn how to merge candlestick charting with Western techniques to\ngauge market movement and locate high probability setups. Chapter 10 shows\nyou how to ﬁnd the reversal signals and how to put them to work in your trad-\ning strategies.\nAfter gaining new knowledge, it is imperative that you immediately prac-\ntice applying what you have learned. To assess your newfound skills, several\npractice sets are included in Chapter 11. There is an old proverb that states: “I\nhear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” You’ll test your\nability to recognize the candlestick patterns and Western technical occurrences\nintroduced throughout the book. It will be time well spent. The answer keys\nand author’s commentary are provided for you to check your work.\nAs its title suggests, Getting Started in Candlestick Charting will provide\nyou enough detailed instruction to get right to work using candlestick charting\nviii\nPREFACE\n",

      "text": "Acknowledgments\nF\nirst I wish to thank Steve Nison for his perseverance in bringing candle-\nstick charting to the Western hemisphere. His groundbreaking books\nJapanese Candlestick Charting Techniques and Beyond Candlesticks con-\nvinced me to add candlestick charting to my repertoire of technical analysis\nskills. I’ve never looked at a chart the same since. Stephen Bigalow was also in-\nstrumental in my candlestick journey. His candlestick books are written based\non his experience using the candlesticks in the trading trenches. Mr. Bigalow\ngenerously invited me to contribute a chapter to his second book High Proﬁt\nCandlestick Patterns. Thanks also to authors Gregory Morris and John Person\nfor their ﬁne contributions on the subject of candlestick charting.\nSpecial recognition goes to two traders who, thankfully, arrived just at the\nright times in my trading career. First, Chris Manning who is responsible for\ngetting me hooked on technical analysis. He had a knack for taking a tough,\nand sometimes dry, subject and making it come alive. His teachings were in-\nstrumental in encouraging me to develop a strong knowledge base in Western\ntechnical analysis. Later I was introduced to Herbert Otto, a nearly 40-year vet-\neran of the markets. I continue to marvel at, and appreciate, how he generously\nshares his vast knowledge of both fundamental and technical analysis.\nWithout the support of my dear friends Michele Furlong and Jelaine\nWhipple, who believe in me and constantly encourage me, I may not have\nsurvived the writing of this book! Pat Johnson and Donna Love deserve praise for\nall they have done in assisting me in so many ways. They have a genuine interest\nin helping people and it does not go unnoticed. And thanks to my friends and\ncolleagues at the Anthony Robbins Companies. I am certain that I would not be\ntrading today had I not made that critical stop in my life’s journey.\nThanks to my family for not complaining as I indulge my obsession with\nthe markets. Although they may not share my enthusiasm for analyzing stock\ncharts for countless hours each week, they seem to have accepted that I will\ncontinue to do so.\nI would like to recognize three amazing women who were mentors at piv-\notal times in my life: Mrs. Muriel Gamble, Mrs. Roberta Cave, and Dr. Deborah\nBallard-Reisch. They all contributed greatly to pushing me forward and\nupward.\nxi\n",

      "text": "1\nIntroduction to\nCandlestick Charting\nW\nhen I ﬁrst began using technical analysis years ago, I used the stan-\ndard bar chart. Eventually, though, I discovered the candlestick chart\nwith its unique display of price action. Just switching from bar charts\nto candlestick lines alone helped my chart analysis tremendously. Candlesticks\nlight up the chart’s canvas, making it very quick and easy to see price trends\nand changes in the sentiment of market participants.\nThe next step was to learn the candlestick patterns with their unusual yet\ninteresting names. After I understood the psychology behind the various patterns,\nI never went back to using bar charts. Once you learn to put this powerful chart-\ning tool to work, I am conﬁdent that you, too, will get hooked on candlesticks.\nAs valuable as candlesticks are as a chart analysis tool, they are simply\nthat—one tool. They should not be viewed in isolation, but instead in the con-\ntext of the surrounding chart landscape. Japanese candlestick charting should\nbe blended with classic Western technical analysis methods rather than replac-\ning them. It is the synergy of the two methods—Eastern merged with West-\nern—that provides the means for superior technical analysis.\nGetting Started in Candlestick Charting will not only provide you with an\nintroduction to candlesticks, but will show you how to analyze them with the\naid of Western techniques. It will guide you down the path toward advancing\nyour charting skills and improving proﬁtability.\nEvolution of Candlesticks\nJapanese candlestick charting is a centuries old methodology that was a secret\nof the Far East for generations. Candlestick charting took root in Japan, where\n3\nChapter\n",

      "text": "the ﬁrst rice exchange was set up in the 1600s. Eventually the exchange was in-\nstitutionalized and the Dojima Rice Exchange in Osaka, Japan opened for busi-\nness. Initially, the merchants dealt only in the exchange of the actual product:\nrice. In the early 1700s, the exchange shifted to the use of rice coupons. Rice\ncoupons were sold against future rice deliveries resulting in the creation of fu-\ntures contracts. The Dojima Rice Exchange was Japan’s largest rice exchange,\nand the world’s ﬁrst futures market.\nThe legendary Japanese businessman Munehisa Homma made a consider-\nable contribution to the early development of what we know today as candle-\nstick charting. In 1750, Homma was granted control of his family’s business,\nwhich included a large rice farming estate. He began trading at the local rice ex-\nchange in Sakata, Japan, a busy port for the collection and distribution of rice,\nand still an important port city today.\nHomma accumulated a great fortune trading in the local and regional rice\nexchanges. It was said that he set up a network that stretched from Sakata to\nOsaka (a few hundred miles), which consisted of men using ﬂags to communi-\ncate from rooftops. Homma kept records of his observations of the psychology\nof rice traders, as well as a historical record of weather conditions and rice\nprices. The trading rules and principles that Homma developed were instru-\nmental to the evolution of candlestick analysis.\nIt wasn’t until a few centuries later that candlestick charting was intro-\nduced in the United States. Candlestick charts have become extremely popular\nsince ﬁrst being introduced in the West in 1989 by author Steve Nison. The\nﬁrst edition of his groundbreaking book Japanese Candlestick Charting Tech-\nniques was released in 1991 (New York Institute of Finance). Before that time,\ncandlesticks were virtually unknown in America. If not for Mr. Nison’s perse-\nverance and passion for the subject matter, the Western hemisphere may have\ncontinued to be unaware of this remarkable analysis tool.\nFortunately for us, Mr. Nison spent an immense amount of time and ef-\nfort researching this charting methodology. This was no easy task. He began his\nresearch and study of candlesticks before the advent of mainstream charting\nprograms, and as such, initially had to create the charts by hand. In addition, it\nalso involved the tedious and difﬁcult translation from Japanese to English. Add\nto that the challenge of interpretation, and some subjectivity that is an inherent\npart of technical analysis, and you can see the magnitude of this undertaking.\nAs with most great endeavors, he accomplished those tasks with the help of key\ncontacts he developed in the United States and abroad.\nTraders who are new to candlestick charting will enjoy the beneﬁts of\nNison’s persistent efforts, as well as the contributions by other authors who\nfollowed his lead. As candlesticks took hold in America, traders embraced\nthem and helped integrate this technology into the realm of Western techni-\ncal analysis.\n4\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\n",

      "text": "The use of candlestick charts has now become so common that nearly all\ncharting programs include them. With the widespread use of computerized\nchart analysis, the candlestick chart has become as well known as the bar chart.\nIn fact, almost every trader that I know uses candlesticks; so I’d surmise that the\ncandlestick chart has caught up with the bar chart in popularity, and perhaps\neven surpassed it.\nIf a technology is not effective it will not last. Experienced traders will\neventually abandon a methodology if it does not prove worthy as an analysis\ntool, which, directly or indirectly, enhances their proﬁts. The fact that candle-\nstick charting has been around for centuries is a testament to its effectiveness.\nStrengths of Candlesticks\nCandlestick charts are superior to bar charts. That is only my opinion, of\ncourse, but it is one that is shared by many skilled chartists. Compare a bar\nchart (Figure 1.1) to a candlestick chart (Figure 1.2) and you’ll see that they in-\nclude the same price data: the open, high, low and closing prices. The candle-\nstick line, however, provides insight into the current psychology of the investing\ncrowd, which is not as easily identiﬁed in a bar chart. Once you become com-\nfortable with the candlesticks, and understand their implications, you may ﬁnd\nthat a standard bar chart looks incomplete.\nSince the candlesticks include the same price data as bar charts, you can\nutilize any of the popular technical analysis tools and techniques that can be\nused with bar charts, such as moving averages and trendlines.\nIntroduction to Candlestick Charting\n5\nFIGURE 1.1\nBar chart\nSource: TeleChart 2007®\nFIGURE 1.2\nCandlestick chart\nSource: TeleChart 2007®\n",

      "text": "Candlesticks make analysis quicker and more efﬁcient. Since the area be-\ntween the opening and closing prices is boxed and colored, it is obvious\nwhether the bar is bearish (black) or bullish (white). In addition, the length of\nthe boxed area tells us how dominant the bears or bulls were during a trading\nsession. You don’t have to stop and “think it through.”\nCandlesticks are tremendous for signaling turning points. They help iden-\ntify the sentiment of investors as price becomes overextended or tests support\nand resistance levels. Their signals are often received earlier than those from tra-\nditional Western indicators or reversal patterns, which make them a strong tool\nfor timing entries and exits.\nAlthough the notion of candlesticks providing primarily short-term sig-\nnals may be seen as a weakness by some traders, that trait can actually be put to\ngood use by swing traders. Swing traders tend to take proﬁts after short-term\nprice moves. Precision entries and exits can make a substantial difference to\ntheir bottom line. Candlesticks provide short-term signals, so they are an excel-\nlent swing-trading tool. It is one of the primary ways in which I use them.\nLimitations of Candlesticks\nCandlesticks are not perfect. Like any technical analysis tool, they do have their\nlimitations and weaknesses as indicated below:\nBecause of their boxed construction, candlestick lines take up more space\non a chart. When a chart is tightly compressed, it may be difﬁcult to see the de-\ntail of each candlestick line. This is not usually a major hindrance for most\nchartists though. Modern charting programs offer the ability to quickly zoom\nout or zoom in to see more or less data on the chart.\nMost candlestick patterns provide only a short-term glance into investor\npsychology. Candlestick signals that form on daily charts may be more beneﬁ-\ncial for shorter-term trading than for longer-term investing. However, since\ncandlesticks can be employed on any time frame, investors may beneﬁt from\nutilizing them on weekly charts.\nCandlestick patterns do not provide price targets. However, Western tech-\nnical analysis does provide techniques for projecting targets, which is a strong\nargument for blending the two methodologies.\nCandlestick reversal patterns do not predict the duration, or magnitude, of a\nprice move. They simply alert chartists to a potential change in the direction of price.\nWith certain setups, by the time a candlestick signal is conﬁrmed price\nmay be well off its low (bullish pattern) or well off its high (bearish pattern).\nTherefore, an entry should not be initiated for a new long or short position\nbased solely on the pattern. The reward compared to the risk should always be\nconsidered when taking any trade.\n6\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\n",

Although numerous traders now pre-\nfer to view price action displayed as candlestick lines, there are still many users\nwho are not proﬁcient in their interpretation. In addition, many traders fail to\ntake advantage of the candlestick patterns.\nSome traders just feel overwhelmed by the number of patterns, along with\ntheir unusual names, that they must commit to memory and learn to recognize.\nOthers may not understand the message of the emotional crowd that is evident\nin the candlestick lines and patterns, and which makes them so valuable. And\nstill other users may not be well versed in Western technical analysis and, as a\nresult, fail to use candlesticks in the proper context.\nGetting Started in Candlestick Charting tackles those challenges. It will\nprovide you a strong foundation of the following:\n• The construction of the candlestick lines and how the candles can pro-\nvide insights into market behavior. By using candlesticks to display\ndata, you should see an immediate improvement in your chart analysis\nskills.\n• An understanding of the psychology of investors that underlies the for-\nmation of several common reversal patterns. You’ll learn how to iden-\ntify those patterns, which will help you to select higher probability\ntrading setups and also improve the timing of your entries and exits.\n• An introduction to several key Western technical analysis concepts.\nThis knowledge will give you a broader view of price action in contrast\nto the narrower view provided by candlesticks.\n• Blending candlestick charting with Western technical analysis in order\nto enhance their signals. By doing so, you’ll enjoy a higher level of suc-\ncess than using either Japanese candlesticks or Western technical analy-\nsis in isolation.\nA common complaint that I hear from traders is that they just get over-\nwhelmed by all there is to be learned in this business. I encourage them to re-\nmain steadfastly focused on the outcome of trading, which is to make money.\nThe outcome is not to ﬁll your mind with an exhaustive amount of data.

Once you have a\nstrong foundation of understanding in place, you’ll ﬁnd it easy to add more\ncandlestick patterns later if desired.\nAlthough there is no way around putting in the time needed to learn a\nnew subject, there are ways to learn that can expedite the process. Getting\nStarted in Candlestick Charting will save you an invaluable amount of time by\nputting your focus in the key areas that will have an immediate and signiﬁcant\nimpact on your trading.\nLearning a new subject, especially a technical one such as chart analysis,\ntakes time and practice. You may need to review this book more than once in\norder to become proﬁcient at utilizing candlestick charts. Remember that repe-\ntition is the mother of skill. The beneﬁts you’ll reap will far outweigh the initial\noutlay of time and effort.\nAdditional Introductory Comments\nThe term candlestick charting is often abbreviated to candlesticks or candles. The\nterms are interchangeable and are all used throughout this book.\nMention of Western technical analysis, bar charts, or chart patterns refers\nto techniques that have been used in America for many decades. Reference to\nJapanese or Eastern technical analysis refers to candlestick lines and candlestick\npatterns that have been used in the Far East for centuries. Whenever the term re-\nversal pattern is used, it should be construed to mean a candlestick reversal pat-\ntern. If a Western reversal pattern is referenced, it will be clearly stated as such.\nThe daily chart is the most commonly viewed time frame. Most of the\ndiscussion and chart examples in this book refer to daily charts; therefore, the\nterm day, session, or trading session is often used to reference a candlestick line.\n(A trading session is one day of trading from the opening bell to the closing\nbell.) Candlestick charting can be used on any time frame. If a time frame other\nthan daily is referenced, it will be clearly noted. The term bar, period, or trading\nperiod may be used in reference to a candlestick line in such cases.\nThe discussion and illustrations in this book focus on U.S. stocks. There-\nfore, the word price is used often; for instance, to describe a price advance or a\n8\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\n",

As long as the prices, or values, that are needed are available, a candlestick\nline can be constructed. For example, the opening, high, low, and closing prices\nare used to construct candle charts for stocks. Index charts, such as the Dow\nJones Industrial Average, do not have prices. Those four price points are repre-\nsented by numerical values for an index.\nIn most charting programs, the chart can be compressed horizontally and\nvertically. The level of compression may impact the look of the candlesticks. In\naddition, the chart adjusts to accommodate new higher, or lower, price points.\nTherefore, if you are looking back from the right edge at historical data, it may\nlook different than it did when it was at the right edge of the chart. Make sure\nto move the chart back when analyzing candlestick lines or patterns using his-\ntorical data. Most mainstream charting programs allow you to back up the\nchart; however, free online services may not offer this feature.\nAll chart examples in this book were produced with permission by TeleChart\n2007®, a registered trademark of Worden Brothers, Inc., Five Oaks Ofﬁce \nPark, 4905 Pine Cone Drive, Durham, NC 27707; phone (800) 776-4940 or\n(919) 408-0542, www.worden.com.\nFor ease of instruction, the terms trader and investor may be used inter-\nchangeably to refer to persons who execute trades, either short or long term.\nHowever, it should be noted that trading typically applies to holding short-\nterm positions and investing generally refers to a longer-term strategy that may\ninclude the analysis of a company’s fundamentals. The term bulls refers to bull-\nish market participants either holding, or considering, long positions. The\nterm bears refers to bearish market participants holding or considering short\npositions.\nThe term security or securities may be used generically to refer to either eq-\nuities, securities or both.

The difference is that, rather\nthan showing the opening and closing prices as small horizontal lines, the area\nbetween those two price points is boxed.\nThe candlestick line is so called because it actually resembles a candle. The\nboxed area is referred to as the real body, or body (Figure 2.3). The thin vertical\nlines drawn above and below the real body are called shadows. A shadow is\nsometimes called a wick because it looks like a wick that extends out either end\nof a candle.\nThe shadows represent the price extremes of the trading session. The verti-\ncal line above the real body, referred to as the upper shadow, represents the differ-\nence between the top of the real body and the highest price of the session. The\nvertical line below the real body, referred to as the lower shadow, represents the\ndifference between the bottom of the real body and the lowest price of the session.\nIf price closes higher than it opens, the session is bullish and the candle’s\nreal body is white (hollow), as shown in Figure 2.4. If price closes lower than it\nopens, the session is bearish and the candle’s real body is black (ﬁlled), as shown\nin Figure 2.5.

In Western technical analysis, the bar’s range is often\nemphasized, which is the distance from the high to the low. The difference be-\ntween the range and the real body is illustrated in Figure 2.6.\nIn Western technical analysis, a bar with a long range from high to low\nmay be referred to as  a wide range bar, regardless of the difference between the\nopening and closing prices. However, when the Japanese refer to a long or tall\ncandle, they are referring to the length (height) of the real body, not the range\nfrom high to low of the session. The Japanese have speciﬁc names for candlestick\nlines that include long shadows, for example, a hammer or a long-legged doji.\nConstructing Candlestick Lines\n13\nMany charting programs allow the option of changing the candlestick\ncolors.

The daily chart is the most com-\nmonly referenced time frame and represents a full day of\ntrading activity. Emotions tend to run high during the\nﬁrst hour of the trading day (after the market open) and\nthe last hour (before the market close). You’ll generally\nsee higher volume during those times than throughout\nthe remainder of the day.\nThere is usually a ﬂurry of activity during the ﬁrst\n30 to 60 minutes of trading each day. That is the time of\nday when the following occurs:\n• Traders respond to company or industry news, or\nglobal events that occurred between the prior trad-\ning day’s close and the current day’s open.\n• Various U.S. government economic reports are released\non certain days each month. Many of those reports are\nreleased prior to the market open.\n• Reactions to news, events, or economic reports often provoke a strong\nsurge, or a gap open to the up or down side, in individual stocks and/or\nmarket averages.\n• Queued-up market orders are ﬁlled, most of which are placed by ama-\nteurs after the close of the previous session.\n• Traders assess the opening activity to determine their intraday strategies.\n14\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\nOnly limit orders are ﬁlled outside of normal trading hours.

That is the time of day when the following occurs:\n• Many trading strategies, especially computerized trading systems, may\ncall for executing “on close” orders for entering or exiting trades.\n• Many breakout strategies require that price close above resistance for a\nlong position, or below support for a short position. This is referred to as\nwaiting for conﬁrmation. Those trades are executed late in the trading day.\n• Day traders close out their accounts to cash before the close of market.\nMuch of that activity occurs during the last half hour of trading.\n• In the futures market, margin calls are determined based on the closing\nprice.\n• A lot of “big money” moves in or out of the markets late in the day.\nThe close is a very important price. In fact, many traders believe it is the\nmost important price of the day. The close tells us the current market value of\nthe stock. The close is also the price most commonly used for chart analysis, to\ncalculate moving averages of price, and so on.\nThe opening and closing prices of candles on intraday charts are not as sig-\nniﬁcant as they are on the daily time frame. Intraday data, which is often called\nreal-time data, ﬂows in a steady stream over the Internet throughout the day.

However, if those higher\nhighs are no longer being made with strong bullish candles, and instead by\ndiminishing real bodies, or if long upper shadows are forming, the upswing may\nbe losing strength. The reverse is true for a downside move.\nIf you look across a chart’s canvas, you’ll see a variety of candle lines with\nreal bodies and shadows of differing lengths. Many of the candle lines will look\nto be about average length. Some of the candle lines will have noticeably longer\nor shorter real bodies than average, and some will have long or short shadows.\nThese are relative terms. What constitutes average, long, and short may vary\nwidely from one stock or index to another. As a general rule, you can look back\nfrom the right edge of a chart at the data for the past few weeks and get an idea\nof what these terms represent for that particular stock or index.\nBy themselves, the distinctive candle lines mentioned in the following\npages tell a story about the current psychology of investors. As you study the\nreversal patterns outlined in Chapter 3, you’ll recognize that certain of these\ndistinctive candle lines are also components of reversal patterns.\nLong Candles\nIf the real body of the candle line is extended, it is referred to as a long, or tall,\ncandle. It represents a signiﬁcant price move for the session and leaves no doubt\nof the bullish or bearish sentiment. Since extended is a subjective term, as a gen-\neral rule, in order to be considered long, the length of the candle’s real body\nshould be about two times the length (or longer) of an average real body for\nthat stock or index.\nA long white candle opens near the low of the session and closes near the\nhigh, leaving little or no upper and lower shadows (Figure 2.7). It is a clear indi-\ncation that the bulls were in control of the session.\nOne or more long bullish candles may form during an uptrend. Al-\nthough the candle line itself shows a strong bullish sentiment during that par-\nticular session, its location in context with the surrounding price action may\ndictate whether the uptrend continues or reverses. Consider the following two\nscenarios:\n1. A long white candle may form after a downtrend and signal a potential\nbullish reversal. One or more long bullish candles may form as a new\nuptrend emerges. It is a sign of bullish interest and strength and the\nuptrend may be just getting started (bullish reversal). \n2. A long white candle may form near the end of an uptrend, or after a\nswift upward move, and signal a potential exhaustion move (bearish re-\nversal). The long bullish candle may actually be the last surge of buyers\ninto the stock and may be followed by a sell-off.\n16\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\n",

One or\nmore long bearish candles may form as a new\ndowntrend emerges. It may be the start of a sell-\noff that corrects the prior uptrend.\n2. A long black candle may form near the end of a\ndowntrend, or after a sharp downside move, and\nsignal capitulation. A ﬁnal last blast of selling\npressure is often followed by a bullish reversal.\nIn Western analysis, the shadows would be in-\ncluded in a reference to a bar’s being long. A long bar\nwould be referred to as a wide-range bar, regardless of the\ndifference between the open and closing prices. In Japan-\nese candlestick charting, reference to a long candle\nshould be interpreted as a long real body. Therefore, a\nsmall-bodied candle with long shadows would qualify as\na wide-range bar in Western technical analysis; while to\nthe Japanese it would not qualify as a long candle be-\ncause its real body is small. Such a candle would be given\na different name, for example, a high-wave candle.\nMost long candles have short upper and lower\nshadows.

What qualiﬁes as short is subjective; it may vary from one\nstock or index to another. The real body of a short candle would be noticeably\nshorter than that of an average real body when looking back over the past few\nweeks of price data. A short candle will have small upper and lower shadows or,\nin some cases, no shadows. If the real body is small, but there are longer upper\nand/or lower shadows, it will be distinguished by a speciﬁc name, such as a\nspinning top or a high-wave candle.\nUnlike a long candle, which shows clear leadership for the session, a short\ncandle shows a lack of leadership. The stock trades in a narrow range all day\nwith neither the bulls nor the bears making much headway.\nA short candle is a component of several bullish and bearish reversal\npatterns. For example, if, after the formation of a long bullish candle, price\ngaps up during the next session and forms a short candle, it is called a bear-\nish star.\nIn Western technical analysis, a short candle may be referred to as a narrow-\nrange (NR) bar.\nShaven Candles\nIf there is no shadow extending from either the top or bottom of the candle’s\nreal body, the candle is referred to as shaven or shaved. Some traders may call\nthese candle lines ﬂat tops and ﬂat bottoms. The Japanese often refer to them as\nmarubozu, meaning “close cropped.”\nIf there is no upper shadow present, regardless of whether the real body is\nblack or white, the candle line is said to have a shaven head (Figure 2.10). If\nthere is no lower shadow present, regardless of color, it has a shaven bottom\n(Figure 2.11).

However, accord-\ning to Steve Nison in his book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques (New\nYork Institute of Finance, 2001, p. 26): “. . . the sizes of the shadows are not im-\nportant. It is the small size of the real body that makes these spinning tops.”\nBy Nison’s deﬁnition, a short candle (mentioned previously) would be a\nspinning top, as would a candlestick line with a small real body and shadows\nthat are longer than the real body (Figure 2.13).

By the end of the session, the candlestick line formed a spinning top.\nThe same concept of drilling down from the daily bar to intraday time\nframes to see the detail can be applied to higher time frames. For example, a\ntrader analyzing a weekly chart could shift down to the daily time frame to see\nthe intraweek price action. To see even more detail, he could shift down to the\nhourly time frame.\nTime Frames\nThe daily chart is the most widely viewed time frame. However, Japanese candle-\nstick charting is applicable to all time frames. Investors who hold their positions\nlong term may use candlestick charting on weekly and daily time frames. Swing\ntraders, who hold for shorter periods, may use candlesticks on daily and hourly\ntime frames. Day traders may employ them on the lower intraday time frames.\nIntraday Charts\nCandlestick lines can be constructed for intraday charts ranging from 1-minute\nto hourly. If you were to look at an hourly chart, for example, the opening price\nwould be the ﬁrst price of that hour. The highest and lowest prices reached dur-\ning that hour would deﬁne the high and low of the candlestick line. The close\nwould represent the ﬁnal price of the hourly trading period.\nCandlestick patterns may become less obvious on low intraday time\nframes, such as 1- or 5-minute charts. With the exception of the open of the ﬁrst\nintraday bar, there is usually not much difference between the closing price of\none bar and the opening price of the next. As such, certain candlestick patterns\nmay not be as prevalent and some may not be as well deﬁned on intraday charts,\nsuch as those that have a gap between the bodies of two consecutive bars.

      "text": "distinctive candle lines and patterns form on intraday charts, their interpretation\nis the same as when they form on daily and higher time frames.\nRecall from previous discussion the important events that occur during\nthe opening and closing hours of a trading day. Those same events will not be\napplicable near the opening and closing times for each intraday period. Be-\ntween the close of one day and the open of the next trading day, enough time\nlapses for traders to digest news and other events that happened overnight or\nover a weekend. Conversely, after the ﬁrst intraday bar on lower time frames has\nformed, there is no time lapse between the close of one bar and the open of the\nnext bar. The candlestick lines are formed from a steady stream of data. There is\nnot sufﬁcient time between each bar for traders to assimilate news or change\ntheir outlook. Therefore, there will not be as much emphasis on the opening\nand closing prices from one bar to the next on intraday charts.\nWeekly Charts\nIf you are analyzing candlestick lines on a weekly chart, the open will be the\nopening price of the ﬁrst trading day of the week. The high and low will be\nthe highest and lowest prices achieved during the trading week. The close will\nbe the closing price on the last trading day of the week.\nIt must be noted that some charting programs provide weekly data in the\nform of a “rolling” week. In other words, if you view a weekly chart on any\ngiven day, you are viewing the price action for the last ﬁve trading days. That\nmeans if you are viewing the weekly chart on a Wednesday, you are seeing the\nprice action from Wednesday of the prior week to Wednesday of the current\nweek. Some charting services may provide a standard week of Monday through\nFriday. In that case, if you view a weekly chart on a Wednesday, you are seeing\nprice action from Monday through Wednesday of the current week. In either\ncase, you won’t know until the close on the last trading day of the week how the\nweekly candlestick line will appear.\nThe rolling week can be problematic in some cases because the current\nweek’s price bar, as well as the historical weekly bars, will adjust daily as the\nweek unfolds. If your charting service utilizes a rolling week, be cautious about\nanalyzing historical weekly charts mid-week because the candlesticks may look\ndifferent than they would if you were to analyze them after Friday’s close.\n26\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\n",

      "text": "3\nCandlestick Reversal\nPatterns\nI\nn the previous chapter, you were shown how the candlestick line is constructed.\nThe term candlestick line is a nonspeciﬁc term used to refer to any single can-\ndlestick on a chart. There are certain candlestick lines, or combinations of lines,\nthat have speciﬁc names and criteria that identify them. They are referred to as\ncandlestick patterns. A candlestick pattern may consist of a unique single line, such\nas a doji; or it may include two, three, or more candlestick lines. For example, an\nevening star pattern includes three candlestick lines in its formation. Candlestick\npatterns that provide reversal signals are the focus of this chapter.\nSome traders may elect to simply make a shift to displaying data as can-\ndlestick lines instead of bar charts. That action alone should improve their\nchart analysis since candlesticks make it quicker and easier to interpret price ac-\ntion. However, most traders who are interested in adding candlestick charting\nto their technical arsenal will choose to delve deeper into the study of candle-\nsticks by learning some, or all, of the candlestick patterns.\nThere are texts available by other ﬁne authors on candlestick charting\n(some are listed in the bibliography at the back of the book). Depending on the\nresource you consult, anywhere from 55 to 68 candlestick patterns may be de-\nscribed. That includes reversal patterns, continuation patterns, and some dis-\ntinctive variations of those patterns. Some of the patterns occur frequently,\nwhile others are rare.\nI have found, through my own experience when I ﬁrst began learning the\ncandlestick patterns, and conﬁrmed through discussions with dozens of my stu-\ndents, that trying to learn too many patterns at once can be counterproductive. Af-\nter learning about half of those 55 to 68 patterns, it all starts to become sort of a\nblur. The result may be some knowledge of a lot of patterns, but a lack of thorough\nunderstanding and comprehension that allows you to put them all right to work.\n27\nChapter\n",

      "text": "In Getting Started in Candlestick Charting, the number of patterns, along\nwith distinctive variations of certain patterns, will be limited to approximately\n20 of the most common and best-known reversal patterns. The rare patterns are\nexcluded, with the exception of a few that are distinct variations of commonly\nformed patterns. For example, a pattern called a gravestone doji is mentioned;\nhowever, it is just a variation of a doji. In addition, continuation patterns are\nnot included. There is a reason the focus will be conﬁned to reversal patterns.\nAccording to Gregory L. Morris, in his book Candlestick Charting Explained\n(McGraw-Hill, 2006, p. 312): “Reversal patterns occur about 40 times more often\nthan continuation patterns.” He goes on to say: “In this analysis, there were 65\nreversal patterns and 23 continuation patterns, which make reversal patterns\naccount for about 74% of all patterns.”\nEqually important, if not more so, to learning candlestick patterns is an\nunderstanding of how to actually put them to work in the context of the\nbroader picture. That will be the primary focus of the chapters in Part II.\nI believe that those of you who are new to this ﬁeld of technical analysis will\nappreciate the “learn less, but better” approach presented in this book. And once\nyou have that strong foundation in place, it will be easy for you to learn additional\npatterns, should you choose to expand your study of candlestick charting.\nCommon Reversal Patterns\nThe candlestick patterns discussed in this chapter are listed in Table 3.1 As the\ntable illustrates, each bearish reversal pattern has a bullish counterpart. The pat-\nterns of the same name, for example, the engulﬁng pattern, can have either\nbearish or bullish implications, depending on whether the pattern forms after\nprice has been rising or falling, respectively. There are also variations of some of\nthe patterns presented along with the primary pattern descriptions.\n28\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\nTABLE 3.1\nCommon Candlestick Reversal Pattern\nBearish Pattern\nBullish Pattern\nHanging Man\nHammer\nShooting Star\nInverted hammer\nDoji (northen)\nDoji (southern)\nDark Cloud Cover\nPiercing Pattern\nBearish Engulﬁng\nBullish Engulﬁng\nBearish Harami\nBullish Harami\nEvening Star\nMorning Star\n",

      "text": "The reversal patterns all share one common trait:\nthey must follow a directional move. Bearish reversal\npatterns form after an upward move. They are consid-\nered to be bearish because they may be followed by a\nshift in price direction from up to down, or from up to\nlateral (sideways). Bullish patterns form after a price de-\ncline and may be followed by a change from down to up\nor from down to lateral.\nDon’t let the idea of having to learn several patterns\nwith their unusual names dissuade you. It is necessary to\nmove past that and instead focus on what is important—\nto really understand what the candle formations tell you about the current psy-\nchology of market participants. Once you understand the value of the patterns,\nI’m sure you’ll agree it is worth the time and effort.\nStocks and markets may vary in their price movement, as well as their\nvolatility. Therefore, you may discover that some patterns occur more or less\nfrequently in one market than another or from one stock to another.\nPattern Format\nA standard format is followed for each pattern whenever possible in order to\nmaintain consistency and ensure that each pattern is thoroughly explained.\nThat format includes the following:\n• The price action that precedes the pattern: either a price advance or a\nprice decline.\n• A description of the pattern and its criteria.\n• An illustration of the pattern. Rising or falling lines will be displayed in\nthe illustrations prior to the pattern example to indicate whether it\nforms after an advance (bearish pattern) or a decline (bullish pattern).\n• The psychology behind the pattern’s formation.\n• A chart that contains a real-world example of the pattern shown in the\ncontext of the surrounding chart landscape.\n• Variations of the pattern where applicable.\n• A helpful hint for remembering the pattern’s name where applicable.\nThe order in which the patterns are presented does not dictate their sig-\nniﬁcance as reversal patterns.\nFor your convenience, a brief summary and illustration of each pattern is\nincluded in Appendix A for quick reference.\nCandlestick Reversal Patterns\n29\ndirectional\nmove\nA price move\nthat is either\nup or down,\nbut not\nsideways.\n",

      "text": "Nonideal Patterns and Variations\nThe illustrations that accompany the reversal pattern descriptions were drawn in\norder to show ideal examples. The purpose of providing textbook examples is so\nthat you have a good benchmark from which to work. Although you will see\nsome ideal patterns when you begin analyzing charts, you should also expect to\nsee plenty of less-than-perfect formations. That does not mean they are not pow-\nerful. Even nonideal versions can provide important clues about shifts in investor\npsychology.\nIn the chart examples presented throughout the book, you’ll view the can-\ndlestick patterns in the context of the broader chart rather than in isolation.\nThat will give you a feel for their real-world applications.\nFor some patterns, an acceptable variation that differs slightly from the\nstandard criteria will be shown. For instance, the ideal dark cloud cover, which\nis a bearish reversal pattern, will gap up open above the prior candle’s high.\nHowever, if it only gaps open above the prior candle’s close, it is an acceptable\nvariation, although not quite as strong in some cases.\nJust like most anything in technical analysis, there is also some subjectiv-\nity involved. One trader may look at a shooting star pattern and dismiss it be-\ncause the upper shadow is only about one and a half times the length of the real\nbody rather than two or more times the length as dictated by the criteria. An-\nother trader may say that is trivial and it is long enough to generate a signal.\nSome of the nonideal patterns and variations are just as strong as ideal\npatterns when viewed in the context of the bigger picture. For instance, if a\nmediocre pattern forms at a strong support or resistance area, it is still likely to\nfollow through. That’s where blending candlesticks with Western technical\nanalysis can be especially helpful.\nIn summary, try not to be too rigid in your expectations or exclude valid\nsignals that are not perfect setups, or you may miss many good trading oppor-\ntunities and important warning signs.\nUmbrella Lines: Hanging Man \nand Hammer\nThe Japanese refer to this formation as an umbrella line because it resembles an\numbrella (see Figures 3.1 and 3.2). However, you’ll rarely hear the term umbrella\nline passed around in conversations among traders in the United States. These\npatterns are simply referred to as the hanging man and the hammer.\nThese two reversal patterns have the same shape. The factor that differen-\ntiates one pattern from the other is whether it forms after a price advance\n(a bearish hanging man) or a price decline (a bullish hammer).\n30\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\n",

They both\ninclude the following criteria:\n• A small real body forms at, or very near, the upper end (the high) of the\ncandlestick’s range.\n• The color of the small real body is not signiﬁcant; it can be either black\nor white.\n• The long lower shadow is typically two or more times the length of the\nreal body.\n• There should be no upper shadow (Figure 3.1) or a very small one\n(Figure 3.2). Price must close near the high of the range.\nThe long lower shadow indicates that the stock declined sharply during\nthe trading session. In fact, at the time price was at the low, the candle had a\nlong bearish real body with a shaven bottom. (Recall the discussion at the end\nof Chapter 2 about how the candlestick line changes\nshape throughout the session.) The bulls were able to\ngrab control from the bears and push price back up to\nclose near the high by the end of the session.\nThe smaller the real body, the shorter the upper\nshadow, and the longer the lower shadow, the more con-\nsequential the pattern.\nHanging Man\nIf an umbrella line forms after a price advance, it is called\na hanging man and it is a bearish signal.

However, that does not necessarily\nmean that a bearish close will result in a higher likeli-\nhood of a top reversal than a bullish close.\nPattern Psychology\nThe bulls have been beneﬁting\nfrom a price advance.

Some traders who already held long positions\nprior to the hanging man may use the intraday recovery\nto take proﬁts near the high.

The inverted hammer is the bullish counterpart of the shoot-\ning star.\nAlthough it does not matter if the small body is black (Figure 3.14) or\nwhite (Figure 3.15), a white body indicates that the bulls were able to rally the\nstock intraday and close the session slightly positive. However, that does not\nnecessarily mean that a bullish close will result in a higher likelihood of a bot-\ntom reversal than a bearish close.\nCandlestick Reversal Patterns\n39\nFIGURE 3.14\nInverted hammer\n(black body)\nFIGURE 3.15\nInverted hammer\n(white body)\n",

Even though the stock fell back and\nclosed near the low, it is now evident that the bulls are showing interest. Astute\ntraders may use the information the inverted hammer provides as motivation to\ncover their short positions. If price moves higher following the inverted\nhammer, a short-covering rally may develop.\nA long upper shadow after a decline may be viewed as a negative develop-\nment because the bulls were not able to sustain the strong rally that occurred in-\ntraday. Therefore, it may be best to wait for more bullish conﬁrmation before\nentering a long position based solely on a signal from an inverted hammer. To\nconﬁrm the signal, price should trade above the inverted hammer’s real body\nthe following session, and ideally it should close above it.\nChart Example\nFigure 3.16 shows a daily chart of Limited Brands Inc.\n(LTD). The long lower shadow that formed on May 15, 2007, was the ﬁrst sign\nthat the decline may be losing its force. The next morning price gapped down\nopen and then rallied, but closed the session back near the low, leaving a bullish\ninverted hammer. The hammer that formed during the following session held\nsupport at the inverted hammer’s low and closed above the inverted hammer’s\nreal body (conﬁrmation). It was followed the next session by a strong white\ncandle, which showed that the bulls had arrived in force.\n40\nCANDLESTICK CHARTING\nFIGURE 3.16\nBullish inverted hammer formed after a price decline\nSource: TeleChart 2007®\n",

      "text": "Doji\nEven though it is comprised of only a single candlestick line, the doji can be a\nvery signiﬁcant signal, especially if it forms at a top. The doji is probably the\nmost commonly referenced candlestick pattern. It gets so much attention that\nsome traders give it too much credit. Although its signal should not be ignored,\nits importance should not be overstated either. A doji should be considered a\nstrong warning, but not a guarantee, that price may change direction.\nPattern Description and Criteria\nThe doji includes the following criteria:\n• The pattern has no real body. The opening and closing prices are ex-\nactly the same, or nearly the same, and are plotted as a horizontal line\nthat intersects the vertical range, as shown in Figure 3.17.\n• The length of the upper and lower shadows can vary.\nAlthough an ideal doji is formed during a trading session in which the\nopening and closing prices are exactly the same, that scenario is not very com-\nmon. If the open and close are nearly the same, it is still considered a doji. If the\nreal body is very small, it is sometimes referred to as a near-doji (Figure 3.18). It\nis important to note that “nearly the same” in reference to the open and closing\nprices is a relative concept.\nCandlestick Reversal Patterns\n41\nIf the opening and closing prices are 5 cents apart, that would not be\nmuch difference for a stock trading at $50. However, it would result in a\nlarger real body on a stock trading at $5. A higher-priced stock, say one\ntrading at $150, may have a difference of 20 cents or more between the\nopen and close and still look like a doji, or a near-doji.\nExample\nFIGURE 3.17\nDoji (no body)\nFIGURE 3.18\nNear-doji (very small body)\n",

A doji\nthat forms after a price advance is more potent and reliable than one that forms\nin a declining market. Steve Nison refers to a doji that forms after a price ad-\nvance as a northern doji (Figure 3.19).\nA doji that appears after a downward move may also result in a change in\nprice direction; however, doji tend to lose some of their potency in a declining\nmarket. It is usually best to wait for more conﬁrmation when a doji forms in a\ndowntrend before entering a long position based solely on its signal. Nison refers\nto a doji that forms at the end of a price decline as a southern doji (Figure 3.20).\nPattern Psychology\nAfter a directional price move, a candlestick with no real body forms, represent-\ning equilibrium between the bulls and bears. The doji represents indecision,\nwhich is not likely to sustain a move. Its appearance should be considered a\nwarning that a change in the trend’s direction may occur.\nChart Example\nFigure 3.21 shows a daily chart of Marchex Inc. (MCHX).

It may also be referred to as a rickshaw man.\nPattern Psychology\nThe long upper shadow indicates that the stock rallied at\nsome point during the session when the high was established. The long lower\nshadow indicates that the stock also sold off sharply at some point during the\nsame session when the low was established. By the close of market, neither the\nbulls nor the bears could claim victory. According to Steve Nison, in his book\nJapanese Candlestick Charting Techniques (New York Institute of Finance, 2001,\np. 162): “These long shadows hint, as the Japanese say, ‘the market has lost its\nsense of direction.’”\nThe long-legged pattern illustrates a volatile struggle between the bulls and\nbears during the session. If you view an intraday chart of the day’s price action,\nit may look somewhat like a roller coaster ride. Refer back to Figure 2.16 in\nChapter 2 to see an example of how a long-legged candle might look intraday.\nChart Example\nFigure 3.23 shows a daily chart of Infosys Technologies\n(INFY).

The\nbearish engulﬁng pattern is generally a stronger reversal signal than the dark\ncloud cover pattern.\nChart Example\nFigure 3.38 shows a daily chart of Bolt Technology Corp.\n(BTJ). A bearish engulﬁng pattern formed on July 9, 2007. This engulﬁng\npattern was made stronger because: it followed a sharp upward move; the\nengulﬁng candle was signiﬁcantly longer than the prior candle; and it was\naccompanied by heavy volume. Price declined during the session following the\nengulﬁng day, and then rallied back up from July 11 to 13 and formed a dark\ncloud cover pattern at resistance provided by the top of the bearish engulﬁng\npattern. That test of resistance also set up a small bearish Western double top\npattern, which was conﬁrmed on July 25 when the stock broke down through\nsupport at the July 10 swing low (dotted line). Price gapped down the next day,\nthen curled back up for three days and tested the prior support (dotted line) as\nresistance before declining further.\nCandlestick Reversal Patterns\n57\nFIGURE 3.37\nAcceptable bearish engulﬁng patterns\n",

As a general rule, the bull-\nish engulﬁng pattern is a stronger signal than the piercing pattern.\nChart Example\nFigure 3.40 shows a daily chart of Biomarin Pharmaceuticals\n(BMRN). A strong bullish engulﬁng pattern formed on May 10, 2007. This\npattern was a major reversal signal for several reasons. First, it formed at prior\nsupport at the April low (dotted line), which set up the potential for a bullish\nWestern double bottom pattern.

Third, the prior day’s real body was very\nsmall (a spinning top). Finally, the engulﬁng session was a long candle with a\nshaven bottom. It not only enveloped the real body of the prior candle, but also\nthe real bodies of the three candles before it.\nThe Western Outside Day\nIn Western technical analysis there is a similar reversal bar pattern to the engulﬁng\npattern called an outside day (or outside bar on other time frames).

There are distinct differences, how-\never, between the Japanese engulﬁng pattern and the Western outside day:\n• The Japanese put the emphasis on the real bodies. The ﬁrst candle of an\nengulﬁng pattern must have a smaller real body than the second candle.\nThe upper and/or lower shadow of the ﬁrst session can extend beyond\nthe range of the second session.\n• The focus of the Western outside day is on the bar’s range from high to\nlow. The range of the ﬁrst bar must be within the range of the second\nbar. Therefore, the shadows of the ﬁrst bar cannot extend beyond the\nsecond bar’s range.\n• The Western outside day does not indicate that the second bar must be\nopposite in sentiment to the ﬁrst bar. The Japanese engulﬁng patterns\nmust have real bodies of opposite color.\nBecause of the differences mentioned above, not all engulﬁng patterns\nqualify as outside days, or vice versa. Figure 3.41 is an outside day because it\nmade a new high and its range surrounded the prior bar’s range. However, it\nwould not qualify as a bearish engulﬁng pattern because the smaller real body\nis not surrounded by the following session’s long black real body. Conversely,\nFigure 3.42 is a bearish engulﬁng pattern, but would not qualify as an outside\nday because it did not make a new high, and therefore the range of the second\nbar does not surround the previous bar’s entire range.\nLike the engulﬁng patterns, a Western outside day can be a negative or\npositive signal, depending on whether it is preceded by a price advance (bearish)\nor a decline (bullish). Figures 3.41 and 3.42 both represent bearish signals after\nupward moves.

The harami is one such pattern.\nThe harami can have bearish or bullish implications, depending on whether\nit forms following a price advance (bearish) or a decline (bullish). It is a two-\ncandle formation that is comprised of a small real body that forms within the\nprior candle’s long real body.\nPattern Description and Criteria\nThe harami pattern includes the following criteria:\n• The ﬁrst candle has a long real body. Its color reﬂects the direction of\nthe trend: black in a downtrend and white in an uptrend.\n• The real body of the second candle is signiﬁcantly smaller than the\nprior candle’s real body. In many instances it will be a spinning top.\n• The second candle’s small real body can be either black or white.\nHowever, in most instances, it is the opposite color of the prior real\nbody.\nThe following criteria will add strength to the harami pattern:\n• The smaller the body of the second candle, the stronger the signal. A\nvery small body shows hesitation.\n• If the second candle is a doji, it is interpreted as even more powerful\nand is called a harami cross.\n• If the small real body (or doji) forms after an unusually long candlestick\nline, it increases the probability of a change in direction.\nThe harami pattern is the opposite of the engulﬁng pattern. Rather than\nengulﬁng the ﬁrst candle’s real body, the harami’s second candle forms within\nthe prior candle’s real body. Another important distinction between these pat-\nterns is that the engulﬁng pattern criterion requires that the two candles be of\nopposite colors, whereas the second session of the harami can be either black or\nwhite.\nAlthough harami patterns may not typically be as strong as some other re-\nversal patterns, such as the engulﬁng patterns or the morning or evening stars,\nthe appearance of a harami is an indication that the market may be losing mo-\nmentum and should signal caution.\nCandlestick Reversal Patterns\n61\n",

Several such chart examples were provided\nin Chapter 3 and more discussion on support and resistance is included\nin Part II.\nBroad Market Environment\nIt is important to pay attention to the broader market. If a broad market rally or\nsell-off occurs, many stocks will rise or fall in kind, at least for the short term.\nThis can have an inﬂuence on the success or failure of reversal patterns. It can\nalso impact how stocks respond to support and resistance levels. When the\nbroad market rallies strongly, you’ll see many stocks break up through resis-\ntance. Conversely, when the broad market melts down, many stocks will break\ndown through previously strong support levels.\nThe market environment may also inﬂuence the\ntype and number of reversal patterns that form on the\ncharts of stocks. At the time of this writing (July–August\n2007), the broad market was experiencing a correction.\nOne of the primary drivers was the problems in the sub-\nprime mortgage market, which hit many ﬁnancial stocks\nhard. It sent a ripple through the markets. The result was\na dramatic increase in volatility. Day after day the Dow\nJones Industrial Average experienced triple-digit ad-\nvances or declines (see Figure 4.3). On many days, the\nintraday action resembled a roller coaster ride. The S&P\n500 Index fared even worse since its component list in-\ncludes many ﬁnancial stocks.\nDuring that volatile period, many candlestick lines\nand patterns formed on charts, which echoed the mar-\nket’s instability. Long shadows were common, highlight-\ning the wide price swings intraday. Although reversal\nformations were prevalent, their signals were very short\nterm and not always reliable given the unsettling envi-\nronment. It was an exasperating time for investors as\nthey worried over their portfolios; however, it was a proﬁtable time for experi-\nenced day traders and swing traders who understood how to beneﬁt from the\nvolatility.\nMore on Reversal Patterns\n83\nstock index\nAn indicator\nused to track\nthe composite\nvalue for a\nparticular \ngroup of\nstocks.

Although the candlestick pat-\nterns introduced in Chapter 3 are referred to as reversal patterns, and they do\nhave the tendency to be followed by a change in the direction of price, it does\nnot mean the patterns will be followed by a trend reversal. A trend reversal is a\nsigniﬁcant event. Price would have to retrace at least two thirds of the prior\ntrend before it technically would be deemed a trend reversal. Moreover, these\npatterns warn that price may reverse the current direction, at least temporarily.\nWhen a bearish reversal pattern forms after an upward move, it signals\nthat price may change direction from up to down, or sideways, and vice versa\nfor a bullish signal after a downward move. If a signiﬁcant reversal does not fol-\nlow a candlestick signal, it does not mean that the candlestick pattern failed.\nMore on Reversal Patterns\n85\nFigure 4.4 shows a daily chart of Morgan Stanley (MS), a brokerage\nstock.

If a pattern is followed only by a pullback\nor period of minor consolidation, the signal was still suc-\ncessful at calling a change in price direction.\nNo matter how strong a reversal signal, or how\nominous its name or appearance, it does not dictate how\nsigniﬁcant the change in price will be (the magnitude).\nCandlestick patterns do not provide price targets. Nor\ndo they predict how long a change in price direction will\nlast (the duration).\nAn entire chapter in Part II is devoted to the dis-\ncussion of trend analysis. Once you’ve completed that\nsegment, you’ll have a better understanding of the role of candlestick patterns\nwithin the bigger picture of price movement.\nFailed Reversal Patterns\nTraders should not expect that every reversal signal will be successful at calling a\nchange in price direction. Reversal patterns can and do fail. To my knowledge,\nnothing in technical analysis works 100 percent of the time. However, it is bet-\nter to respond to a signal that turns out to be false than to ignore a valid one.\nPrice should change direction shortly after the emergence of a reversal pat-\ntern. If, instead, price immediately moves again in the direction of the trend,\nthe signal has been negated. For example, if a bearish hanging man forms and\nprice fails to close below the hanging man’s real body, and instead moves higher,\nthe hanging man’s signal is no longer valid. If price is still overextended, though,\nthe stock is vulnerable and additional reversal signals may follow. Refer back to\nFigure 3.27 in Chapter 3 for an example. On that chart, a hammer formed dur-\ning a sharp decline, but price continued lower in the next session, negating its\nbullish signal. Two days after the hammer’s failed signal, a long-legged doji\nformed at support. Buyers stepped in at that level and many shorts covered\nstopping the stock’s fall.\nThe probability of follow-through can be enhanced by combining the\nreversal signals with classic Western technical analysis, which is the focus of\nPart II.\nReversal Pattern Psychology\nOne of the most important aspects to absorb when studying the reversal pat-\nterns is the psychology behind their formations.

Although the Japanese do put\na lot of emphasis on the candlestick’s real body, the shadows can also tell\nus a lot about the psychology of market participants. Therefore, shadows play an\nimportant role in chart analysis. The following discussion speciﬁcally addresses\nthe formation and implications of long shadows.\nLong shadows are often called tails. As you learned in Chapter 3, there are\nseveral reversal patterns that include tails in their formation, for example, the\nhanging man and the shooting star. Not every candlestick line that forms a\nlong shadow will meet the criteria of a speciﬁc candlestick pattern. Regardless\nof whether the formation has a name or not, it is important to understand the\nmessage behind a tail.\nLong upper shadows are bearish shadows (Figure 5.1). The presence of one\nor more bearish shadows after a price advance demonstrates that the market is\nreaching for a top. There is not enough demand at higher prices to continue to\npropel the stock upward, at least for the short term. This is especially evident\nnear a resistance area or in an overbought condition. The tail(s) indicates that\nthe bulls are taking proﬁts and bears are stepping into short positions.\nThe presence of long upper shadows on a standard bar chart can be de-\nceiving. They might come across as bullish since price may still be making\nhigher highs and, in some cases, higher closes. The candlestick line makes it\neasy to see, though, that price has closed well off its high. The inability of the\nbulls to sustain the intraday rally and close nearer the high is actually a bearish\nsign if it occurs after a price advance. \nLong lower shadows are bullish shadows (Figure 5.2). The formation of\none or more bullish shadows after a price decline, especially near support or\nin an oversold condition, shows us visually that the market is reaching for a\nbottom. In this case, the tail(s) indicates that lower prices are being rejected.\n91\nChapter\n",

Price\naction is a manifestation of the combined psychology of all market participants.\nIt tells us the perceived value of a security at a given time.\nPrice action provides the setups that we trade.\nThere are numerous price setups for traders to choose\nfrom. For example, candlestick patterns provide setups,\nas do classic Western bar and chart patterns such as key\nreversals and head-and-shoulders patterns.\nA setup by itself cannot make you money; however, a\nstrategy for trading it can. A trader may achieve consistent\nsuccess by learning to recognize one or more price setups\nand devising a proﬁtable strategy to trade the setup(s).\nA strategy should seek to enhance proﬁts while limiting\nrisk.\nMany novice traders get caught up in looking for the\nperfect technical indicator and neglect to put sufﬁcient em-\nphasis on price. It is more effective to learn how to evaluate\nthe price action and use indicators as complementary\nanalysis tools. When an aspiring trader points out an indi-\ncator signal to me, such as an overbought or oversold oscil-\nlator, and asks if I would execute a trade, I respond, “It\ndepends on what is happening with price.” I do not enter\nor exit a trade based solely on a signal from an indicator.\nThink of technical analysis as a big toolbox. Just as candle-\nstick charting is one tool, indicators are another type of\ntool. Successful trading results from employing a set of\ntools rather than using each one in isolation.\nMany technical indicators are derived from price.\nMoving averages are calculated by averaging the price of\na stock over a designated period of time, for example, 20 days. Oscillators are a\ngroup of indicators that measure the momentum of price. These indicators are\ndiscussed later in this book. Technical indicators can be very useful; however, it\nis still the price action itself that conﬁrms or invalidates an indicator’s signal.\nPart I of this book was devoted almost entirely to the discussion of price.\nThe candlestick lines and patterns are formed from the open, high, low, and\nclosing prices during a trading period. The candlestick reversal patterns must\nfollow a directional price move in order for their signals to have signiﬁcance.\nThere is still plenty more discussion to come on price movement as you’ll\nsee in chapters 7 through 9, which cover trend analysis, gaps, support, and resis-\ntance.

      "text": "Analyzing Volume Patterns and Trends\nThe amount of volume that transpires during one or more trading periods can\ntell a story about the force behind the price movement. Consider the following\nexamples:\n• If heavy volume accompanies the formation of a bullish candlestick\npattern, such as a hammer or a bullish engulﬁng pattern, it helps con-\nﬁrm that the stock may be putting in a bottom.\n• An upside breakout after a period of consolidation is usually accompa-\nnied by heavy volume. In fact, the breakout is suspect if not and may be\na false breakout. Volume attracts more buyers and is needed to propel\nthe stock higher. Heavy volume may also accompany a downside break;\nhowever, it is not as signiﬁcant because the market can continue to fall\nunder its own weight.\n• After an upward move, if price pulls back or consolidates on diminish-\ning volume, it is usually an indication that short-term traders are taking\nproﬁts after a directional move rather than a large number of market\nparticipants exiting the stock. Another upside move often follows in\nsuch cases.\nPrice, Volume, and Volatility\n103\nIt is a common practice to plot a moving average over an indicator in\norder to smooth the data. I was ﬁrst introduced to the idea of plotting\na moving average of volume in John Bollinger’s book Bollinger on\nBollinger Bands (McGraw-Hill, 2002). Mr. Bollinger referenced using a\n50-period simple moving average, but I prefer a shorter 30-period as\ndemonstrated in Figure 6.1. The moving average is overlaid on the\nvolume histogram in the panel below the chart window. This technique\nmakes it very easy to see when volume is above or below average\ncompared to the last 30 days. Experiment with different settings if\nyou’d like; however, I would not suggest using a length of fewer than\n20 periods for this purpose.\nSmart Investor Tip\nbars are colored red or green, which corresponds to the current time period’s\nclosing price. A red volume bar indicates a lower close than the prior trading\nperiod, and a green bar indicates a higher close. Figure 6.1 shows the volume\nbars plotted in the panel below the chart window.\n",

Incorporating volume in the ex-\namination of price movement can dramatically improve your stock selection\nand chart analysis skills.\nThe preceding examples are instances where fairly short-term events are\nanalyzed. It is important to distinguish between analyzing a short-term vol-\nume pattern and a longer-term volume pattern or trend. If you are examining\nthe volume pattern over the past several trading periods, volume can be ana-\nlyzed from one bar to the next, providing a short-term picture. For instance,\nif after an upward move price pulls back on diminishing volume, in such a\ncase you are looking at the price-volume relationship from one bar to the next\nas price pulls back. By my deﬁnition, diminishing volume occurs when most\nof the volume bars during the period being analyzed either drop below the\nmoving average of volume or decline in a downward stepping pattern (see\nFigure 6.2, left).\nThere may also be times when you wish to evaluate the volume pattern\nover a longer period of time. For example, you may need to gauge the\nstrength of the longer trend, or analyze the price-volume relationship of a\nlarge chart pattern.

The following discussion addresses\nsome technical tools and methods to help determine the direction of a trend.\nMoving Averages\nThe moving average is one of the oldest and most widely used technical indica-\ntors. Moving averages are trend-following indicators designed to catch major\nprice moves. They are most effective when used in trending markets and fairly\nineffective when price moves into a prolonged trading range. Moving averages\nare not precise timing indicators. While they do a good job of pointing out the\ndirection of the trend, moving averages “lag” price, so they will be late at calling\nthe turning points when a trend changes direction.\nThere are various ways to utilize moving averages.\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we’ll focus on the\nrole of moving averages in helping determine the direc-\ntion of the trend. In Chapter 9, you’ll learn how they\nalso play a role as support and resistance. Novice traders\nare encouraged to pursue additional study of moving av-\nerages, as well as other technical indicators that are be-\nyond the scope of this book.\nA trend does not develop in a straight line.

However, these technical events also occur in downtrending\nmarkets.\nLong-Term Trend\nThe long-term trend may also be referred to as the major or primary trend.\nSome sources state that a long-term trend is one that is in effect for at least a\nyear. However, many traders, myself included, consider a trend of six to eight\nmonths or longer to fall under the category of long term.\nA long-term trend may be strung together by a series of shorter, intermediate-\nterm trends. Price may move in the direction of the long-term trend for several\nweeks or months at a time, followed by an interruption of the trend that may\nalso last for weeks or months. Those interruptions may be in the form of con-\nsolidation (sideways movement) or a correction in which price moves against\nthe long-term trend.\nTrend Analysis\n127\nFigure 7.12 shows a daily chart of O2 Micro International Ltd.\n(OIIM).

Parallel, horizontal\ntrend lines can be drawn to deﬁne the consolidation area. The 20-\nperiod simple moving average (SMA) ﬂattened out during those\nmonths. Price broke out from the trading range on April 5, resuming\nthe long-term uptrend. The stock consolidated again from May\nthrough June. That consolidation was tighter than the prior\nconsolidation.

The tone of the broad market can have a strong im-\npact on individual stocks. In the United States, the three best-known averages\ninclude: the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq\nComposite Index.\nWhile the direction of short- and intermediate-term trends of the averages\ncan be inﬂuenced by rumor, news, and the sentiment of market participants,\nthe long-term trend of the market is driven primarily by fundamental factors.\nThe major trend reﬂects the condition of the U.S. economy and may also be\nimpacted by global markets.\nA long-term uptrend that occurs on an index chart is referred to as bull\nmarket and a long-term downtrend is called a bear market. As of this writing,\nthe broad market was still in a long-term uptrend (see Figure 7.16). During\nJuly–August 2007, however, the major averages experienced a bull market cor-\nrection (see Figure 7.17) of about 10 percent (many individual stocks declined\nmuch more).\nMultiple Time Frames\nWhether evaluating the charts of individual stocks or market averages, take ad-\nvantage of different time frames to analyze trends. The long-term trend is usu-\nally quite obvious on a weekly or monthly chart. The higher time frame\nprovides a bigger picture view and eliminates much of the “noise” of the lower\ntime frames.

What may appear to be a small move on the chart may actu-\nally be a signiﬁcant percentage move.\nTrend Analysis\n141\nFigure 7.22 shows a daily chart of Echelon Corp. (ELON). Price pulled\nback to the 20-period SMA in late July 2007. Price consolidated for a\nfew days followed by a strong swing up. At that point price had moved\naway from the average, leaving a pocket of air below and the stochastic\noscillator provided an overbought reading, indicating the move was\noverextended. (The stochastic oscillator is discussed later in this\nchapter.) Price then turned down for several days, ﬁnally stopping at the\n50-period SMA. Recall that you can quickly look at the logarithmic\nscale to get a gauge of the stock’s current volatility. To ﬁnd out exactly\nhow far this stock fell, calculate the distance from the high of the\nupswing ($32.49) to the low of the downswing ($19.92). The difference\nwas $12.57, or a  decline of approximately 39 percent from the swing\nhigh to the swing low. Notice that a long lower shadow formed the\nswing low indicating that bulls were willing to step into long positions\nat the 50-period moving average.\nExample\n(continues)\nprobability\nThe likelihood,\nbut not a\ncertainty, of\nsomething’s\nhappening or\nbeing true.\n",

When looking back\nfrom the right edge of the chart at a stock that trended for a long period of\ntime, you may think you could have just held on through all the pullbacks and\nperiods of consolidation. Looking at a past chart of a stock in which you held\nno position is a quite different situation than monitoring a live trade in which\nreal proﬁts are at stake. In some cases a trader can hold on for much of the trend\nusing a trailing stop. However, in many cases a trader may get stopped out one\nor more times as the trend evolves. And if a stock is volatile, what might look\nlike it was a minor pullback on the chart may have equated to a signiﬁcant per-\ncentage decline.\nAlthough holding through a decline may not sound like a big deal, that’s\nwhere experience, with real money invested, is needed in order to determine\npsychologically what you can handle. Short-term traders typically do not plan\nto hold through pullbacks. If a short-term trader ﬁnds himself holding\nthrough a lot of pullbacks, it may be an indication of poor trade selection and\nmanagement. Lack of discipline will lead to failure in this business. Plan your\ntrades in advance and know what justiﬁes an entry, where to exit with a proﬁt\nif the trade goes as expected, and where to exit with a protective stop in case it\ngoes against you.\nBeware of Chasing Overextended Stocks\nA common mistake made by inexperienced traders is to chase after a stock en-\ntering a position when price has become overextended. Unfortunately, new\ntraders often are not aware of the concept of reversion to the mean. Even those\nwho are aware may choose to take the gamble, hoping that price will continue\nto move unabated. They let their emotions get the best of them. Emotional de-\ncisions typically lead to sloppy trade execution and losses that could have been\navoided.\nExperienced traders do not generally buy the swing high (or sell the swing\nlow) and then hold on trying to ride out a pullback. More often, it is the expe-\nrienced traders who are gladly selling their shares near the swing highs to the\nnovice traders who shouldn’t be buying at such overextended levels. The traders\nwho buy the swing highs are sometimes called the “greater fools,” because there\nis no greater fool willing to pay higher prices, so they are left holding the bag, so\nto speak, as the stock turns against them.\nThe experienced traders are also the ones who are waiting to take the\nshares off the hands of the novices who bail out because the pain of entering\ntoo high, and then having to hold through the subsequent pullback, becomes\ntoo much for them. In other words, experienced traders look to enter on\nweakness (pullbacks or consolidation) and exit into strength as price gets\noverextended.\nTrend Analysis\n143\n",

In his book Technical Analysis of the Fi-\nnancial Markets (New York Institute of Finance, 1999, p. 228), John Murphy\ndeﬁnes momentum as follows: “Momentum measures the velocity of price\nchanges as opposed to the actual price levels themselves.”\nOscillators are a group of indicators that measure the momentum of price\n(the rate of its ascent or descent). Price often loses momentum before it actually\nchanges direction; thus, oscillators may act as “leading” indicators of price.\nWhile there are many different oscillators with different methods used to calcu-\nlate them, their interpretation doesn’t vary much. Be careful using too many os-\ncillators because they basically measure the same thing.\nThere are usually at least a few oscillators to\nchoose from in most charting programs. Stochastics and\nWilder’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) are among the\nbest known.\nUnlike moving averages, which tend to whipsaw\nwhen price moves sideways, oscillators are effective in a\nnontrending environment. They can help catch the turn-\ning points when price swings back and forth across a\ntrading range. The oscillator’s ﬂuctuations tend to corre-\nspond to the peaks and troughs in price. Oscillators are\nnot limited to nontrending environments. They can also\nbe helpful in a trending market. Oscillators have several\nuses in this regard:\n• Overextended conditions.

When higher peaks are forming in an uptrending\nmarket, but the peaks of the oscillator are declining, a negative (bear-\nish) divergence exists. In a downtrending market, if price is forming de-\nclining bottoms, but the oscillator bottoms are rising, it signals a\npositive (bullish) divergence. A divergence between price and the oscil-\nlator is a sign that the trend may be weakening.\n• Relationship to the midpoint. Many oscillators have a midpoint. For\nsome oscillators that point is zero; others that move along a scale of 0\nand 100 have midpoints of 50. When price turns up after a downtrend,\nthe oscillator will cross the midpoint and remain above it for most of\nthe uptrend, and vice versa when price reverses from up to down.\nTraders may use the crossing of the midpoint as a buy or sell signal.\nFor now, we’ll focus on using an oscillator, namely stochastics, to help de-\ntermine when price may be overextended.\nStochastic Oscillator\nThe stochastic oscillator is a very popular momentum indicator developed by\nGeorge Lane. It is based on the premise that when price is trending up, the clos-\ning prices will tend to be near the high of the price range. In a downtrend, the\nclosing prices will be nearer the low of the price range.\nThe indicator includes two lines: the faster %K line and the slower %D\nline. The %K line is the stochastic. The %D line is a moving average of %K,\nwhich smoothes the stochastic and acts as a signal line. The result is two lines\nthat oscillate between ﬁxed lower and upper boundaries of 0 and 100 percent,\nrespectively (Figure 7.23).\nTrend Analysis\n145\nFIGURE 7.23\nStochastic oscillator\nSource: TeleChart 2007®\n",

As is usually the case with technical indicators,\nif you opt for speed, you give up some accuracy, and vice versa. A\nstochastic length of 14 will produce slightly slower signals, but they may\nbe more accurate. A length of 12 will produce faster signals, although\nthere may be more false signals.\nExample\nWithin the boundaries of 0 and 100 lie the overbought line (80) and the\noversold line (20). A reading of over 80 is considered to be high; it indicates\nthat the current closing price is near the top of the designated range. Con-\nversely, a reading of below 20 is considered to be low; the current closing price\nis near the low end of the designated range.\nOverbought and Oversold Conditions\nThe stochastic oscillator can be used to alert traders of short-term price ex-\ntremes. At times, price moves for too long, or too far too quickly, in one direc-\ntion. The result is an overbought (uptrend) or oversold (downtrend) condition.\nThese conditions are generally short term in nature and can be alleviated by a\npullback, correction, or a period of consolidation. In a strong trending market,\nconﬁdent bulls (uptrend) or bears (downtrend) will often step back into trades\nonce the short-term overextended condition has been alleviated. There will cer-\ntainly be cases when the trend will reverse after such conditions arise; however,\nit takes a consensus by many market participants to reverse a strong trend.\nTherefore, overbought and oversold signals should generally be interpreted to\nbe short term in nature unless there is additional evidence that a trend reversal\nis in the making.\nIf a bearish candlestick reversal pattern forms while stochastic is in over-\nbought territory, or if a bullish reversal pattern forms while stochastic is in\noversold territory, it strengthens the candlestick signal.

For decades, gaps have been recognized in\nWestern technical analysis. However, the identiﬁcation and analysis of gaps did\nnot originate in the West. The Japanese utilized gaps in their analysis long be-\nfore they became known in the Western hemisphere. In Japanese candlestick\ncharting, price gaps are referred to as windows.\nIn this chapter, you will be introduced to price gaps and a very common\nevent called the morning gap. Since the term gap is so well known, for consis-\ntency, gap will be used throughout most of this discussion rather than the\nJapanese term windows.\nPrice Gaps\nA price gap is also called a true gap because it leaves a void on the chart. The\ngap is still open by the end of the daily trading session, leaving empty space\nwhere no trading took place. Neither the real bodies nor shadows of the two\nconsecutive bars that form the gap can overlap.\nIn order for an upside gap to form, the low of the\ncurrent bar must be above the high of the previous bar\n(Figure 8.1). The Japanese refer to an upside gap as a ris-\ning window. For a downside gap to occur, the high of the\ncurrent bar must be below the low of the prior bar (Figure\n8.2).

Rather than iden-\ntifying gaps based strictly on the direction of the gap, either upside or downside,\nthey are also deﬁned by the price action that precedes and follows the gap. There\nare several different types of gaps observed in Western technical analysis.\nAn area gap occurs when price gaps either up or down\nwithin a trading range. An area gap may also be called a\ncommon gap or a pattern gap. Figure 8.3 shows two area gaps\nthat formed while price was consolidating. These gaps have\nvery little technical signiﬁcance. They are usually ﬁlled\nquickly as price moves up and down between the bound-\naries of the trading range (the dotted lines in Figure 8.3).\nA breakaway gap is a technically signiﬁcant gap. It\noften marks the beginning of a strong price move. An\nupside breakaway gap is a bullish signal that occurs when\nprice gaps above and closes above resistance. It should be\naccompanied by heavy volume. A downside breakaway\ngap is a bearish signal that occurs when price gaps below\nand closes below support. A downside breakaway gap\nmay be accompanied by heavy volume, but if it is not, it\ndoes not take away from the signal like the upside gap. It\nusually takes more force to propel price higher than for a\nstock to decline.\nA continuation gap occurs when a stock is trending\nand price leaps forward, accelerating the move. A contin-\nuation gap may also be called a runaway gap.

In an uptrend, this price action is called a bearish island top.\nIf it occurs in a downtrend, it is a bullish island bottom.\nWhen Has a Price Gap Been Filled?\nThe market does not like voids on a chart so there is a strong tendency for gaps\nto be ﬁlled. Most gaps are eventually closed. Some gaps are ﬁlled quickly, for ex-\nample, most area gaps and exhaustion gaps. Others may take weeks, months, or\neven years to close. A breakaway gap, or a gap that occurs at the beginning of a\nlong trend, may not be ﬁlled for a long time. There are occasions, although they\nare infrequent, when a gap is never ﬁlled.\nAfter an upside gap forms on a chart, at some time in the future, price may\nfall back through that void. If price declines back to or near the bottom of the\nvoid, the gap has been closed (Figure 8.7). The reverse may occur with a down-\nside gap. In Western technical analysis, this price action is referred to as ﬁlling or\nclosing the gap. The Japanese would say, “The window has been closed.”\nPrice will not always ﬁll the gap entirely. In some instances, much of the\ngap will be ﬁlled, but price changes direction again before ﬁlling the entire gap.

Conversely, when a downside gap is ﬁlled, the top of the void\nshould act as resistance. If price closes above the gap, resistance has been bro-\nken, which is a bullish sign.\nInterpreting Price Gaps\nThe Japanese refer to a gap as a continuation pattern. An upside gap is inter-\npreted as bullish, and a downside gap is bearish. This is only a general concept,\nthough. Be careful about trying to employ a “one size ﬁts all” rule in technical\nanalysis. Just because an upside gap is considered bullish does not mean price\nmay not decline ﬁrst or move sideways before resuming the uptrend, and vice\nversa for a downside gap. In addition, don’t expect price to always move again in\nthe direction of the gap. Sometimes price reverses direction, trades back through\nthe gap, and just keeps going, resulting in a reversal rather than a continuation\nof the trend.\nThe context in which the gap forms should be considered. Each price gap\nshould be analyzed individually when determining how to respond to it. Fol-\nlowing are some factors to consider:\n• Size of the gap.\n• Price action that preceded the gap. Did the stock gap out of consolida-\ntion? How far had price already moved prior to the gap? Is price overex-\ntended and vulnerable to a change in direction?\n• Surrounding chart landscape. Is there resistance nearby that may cause\nan upward price move to stall or reverse (or support below that may\nstop a downside move)?\n• Style of trading utilized. Is this a short-term trade or a longer-term trade\nthat may be held for weeks or months?\n• Trader’s temperament. What is the trader’s risk tolerance and risk and\nmoney management rules?\n• Current volatility of the stock.\n• Current environment of the broader market.\nThe discussion that follows addresses these factors and is intended to pro-\nvoke thought on how you might interpret and react to an upside gap. The same\nthought processes should be considered when analyzing a bearish gap, except\nthat the gap is to the downside.\nFigure 8.8 shows a daily chart of Checkpoint Systems Inc. (CKP).

The swing trader would not wish to hold through such a decline.\nAnd, in fact, is the investor willing to allow the stock that much room to pull\nback? Even for longer-term trades the volatility should be considered. Say that\nTrader B has a risk management rule (recommended) that she will not allow a\nlong-term position to reverse more than 15 percent from the current price or\nthe stock will be exited. That is not to say that a stop should be placed an ar-\nbitrary 15 percent away from the current price, but rather it should be placed\nat a technical level not to exceed the maximum allowed reversal of 15 percent.\nIn that case, Trader B’s stop is likely to be triggered. If FMT pulls back and\nﬁlls the gap, the distance to the bottom of the void is almost 10 percent fur-\nther than Trader B’s maximum stop level would allow.\n160\nEAST MEETS WEST\nFIGURE 8.9\nHigh percentage decline back to the bottom of the gap\nSource: TeleChart 2007®\n",

Trading successfully\nmeans considering other factors that can impact your trades.\nThe Morning Gap\nA morning gap is also called an opening gap because it occurs at the open of a\ndaily trading session. Morning gaps are very common on daily charts; much\nmore so than true gaps. They occur due to order imbalances that are managed\nby market makers at the open. (Morning gaps occur on stocks but not on the\ncharts of continuous 24-hour futures.)\nAll gaps actually start out as opening gaps. A true\ngap must open beyond the prior day’s range: above the\nprior high for an upside gap and below the prior low for\na downside gap. By the close of market that gap has\nnot been ﬁlled, which leaves a void on the daily chart.\nA morning gap also gaps up or down at the open;\nhowever, it does not leave a void on the daily chart. The\ngap is closed during the trading session. Figure 8.10\nshows the contrast between a true gap and a morning\ngap.\nA morning gap is deﬁned by the opening and clos-\ning prices of two consecutive daily bars. In order to form\nan upside morning gap, price must open above the prior\nGaps\n161\nThe maximum stop level may vary from one trader to the next\ndepending on risk tolerance and trading style. For example, a\nmaximum of 10 percent may be employed for a swing trade versus 15\npercent for a longer-term trade. A day trader may have a much lower\nmaximum, such as 3 to 4 percent, or even less. Note: The maximum\nstop loss for an individual trade should not exceed 2 percent of the\ntotal account equity.

The prior day’s close is a natural support\nlevel so it is not unusual to see price stop falling there.\n• The current day’s lower shadow pierces the prior day’s real body (not\nshown, but if the lower shadow in Figure 8.11 was longer it would be\nan example).\n• The current day’s real body touches, protrudes into, or engulfs, the\nprior day’s real body (Figure 8.12).\nThe fact that there is an overlap between the real bodies, or their shadows,\nby the end of the session means it cannot be a true gap.\nVariations of the Morning Gap\nA variation of the morning gap occurs when price gaps up open above the prior\nbar’s high, trades back to the prior bar’s high or lower, but does not decline all\nthe way back to the prior bar’s close (Figure 8.15).

Will a void remain on the chart (a true gap), or will\nthe gap be closed, resulting in a morning gap? Remember, though, that morn-\ning gaps occur frequently; much more so than true gaps.

Again, the following should be considered:\n• The size of the gap\n• The price action that preceded the gap\n• The surrounding chart landscape\n• The style of trading utilized\n• The trader’s risk tolerance and risk and money management rules\n• The current volatility of the stock\n• The current environment of the broader market\nSince morning gaps are very common, traders who hold long-term posi-\ntions may choose to ignore many opening gaps. Otherwise, they may exit a po-\nsition prematurely. Even when holding longer term, though, situations may\narise in which an opening gap should not be ignored. Always consider the con-\ntext in which the gap formed.\nSwing traders are much less inclined to ignore an opening gap.

The remainder of this chapter is devoted to discussion of\nhow morning gaps can affect short-term positions and how swing traders may\nchoose to respond to such events. The discussion and examples refer to trading\nlong positions; however, the same concepts apply inversely for shorting. Even if\nmost of your trades are longer term, you should review the remaining pages, as\nyou may pick up some valuable information.\nThe Opening Gap’s Role in \nSwing Trading\nThe opening gap is an important concept to understand and is a component of\nmany day-trading and swing-trading techniques and strategies. Trading deci-\nsions should not be based on emotions; they should be based on logical conclu-\nsions. Knowing that most opening gaps will reverse direction intraday should\nbe a consideration when swing traders deﬁne their short-term strategies.\nLocation Matters\nJust as it matters where a candlestick reversal pattern forms on a chart (it must have\na move to reverse), it matters where an opening gap occurs. It is important to con-\nsider the price action that preceded the gap. If a trader holds a long position in a\nstock that has just started to move up, an opening gap, especially a small one, may\nnot be a signiﬁcant event. However, if price has already moved a good distance\naway from the average, an upside opening gap may be much more meaningful. It\nmay represent a signal to exit all, or at least part, of a swing position, particularly if\nprice gaps open substantially beyond the prior trading session’s close.\nRecall from Chapter 7 that price tends to revert to the mean. Thus, when\nprice has moved away from the average on the daily chart, it becomes vulnera-\nble to a pullback or at least a period of consolidation. Swing traders typically try\nto avoid getting caught in a pullback that may take back part of the gains\nachieved during a price advance (or sometimes all of the gains if proper risk\nmanagement is not employed). They should be on the alert for warning signs\nthat indicate a potential end of the short-term trend. In some cases, a warning\ncomes in the form of an opening gap.\nSince most opening gaps reverse direction intraday, that means it is common\nfor price to decline back to the prior trading session’s close, and potentially farther.\nWhen deciding whether to exit an opening gap, a trader should check the prior ses-\nsion’s close and determine if he would be willing to hold back to that point. If not,\nthe opening gap can be used to lock in additional proﬁts. A stock’s volatility should\nalso be considered. If a stock is volatile, an opening gap may be bigger than it\nappears on a percentage basis. Looks can be deceiving where volatility is concerned.\nGaps\n167\n",

But that is not the only concern. Often, an opening gap\nmarks the beginning of a pullback on the daily chart.

Morning gaps\nare very common. Even though most of them may reverse the opening direc-\ntion intraday, it does not necessarily mean the stock will continue to decline\nduring the following days. Sometimes opening gaps will occur day after day, ﬁll-\ning (or partially ﬁlling) each day, but price continues in the direction of the trend.\nAnd even if a stock has moved well away from the average prior to the gap-up\nopen, there will still be instances in which the stock will continue to rise instead\nof moving sideways or pulling back.

Traders\nshould do so cautiously, as the bid-ask spreads can be signiﬁcantly wider than\nduring regular trading hours. However, if a trader owns a stock that is trading\nactively in premarket—heavily enough that the spread is not prohibitive—exit-\ning in premarket is a viable option in many instances. Only limit orders will be\nﬁlled during premarket hours.

If it is trading at prices\nlower than the prior session’s close, it has already gapped\ndown.

When price approaches such an obvious ceiling or ﬂoor, the\ntrend is vulnerable once again to a change in direction. Those areas may be\ntested again and again.

Those are not just\nminor peaks and bottoms within an up or down trend that can be\nsurpassed easily.

Many novice traders are not aware of the correla-\ntion and simply adopt the use of the 50- and 200-period moving averages, as-\nsuming they will work on various time frames, and often they do.\nDebate over Simple versus Exponential\nThe simple method of calculating a\nmoving average was presented in Chapter 7 and is the most commonly used.\nThe simple method assigns equal weight to each day’s price that is included in\nthe average. There are other ways to calculate a moving average, including\nassigning a different weight to one or more of the prices in the set. One such\nmethod that is popular among traders is an exponentially smoothed moving\naverage that weights the most recent prices heavier than the older prices.\nWhether you use simple or exponential moving averages is a matter of personal\npreference. Fortunately, mainstream charting programs do the calculations for\nus, and users are given the option of selecting either simple or exponential.\nSMAs are used exclusively in the chart examples provided in this book for\nconsistency, and to avoid displaying a “busy” chart that may distract from the\ntechnical event(s) being emphasized. However, I do monitor both simple and ex-\nponential moving averages (EMAs). Many mainstream charting programs offer\nusers the ability to conﬁgure multiple chart templates. Different indicators can\nbe assigned to the various templates if desired to avoid indicator overload on one\ntemplate. One of my templates includes both the exponential and simple version\nof the 50- and 200-period moving averages. I can quickly jump to that template\nwhenever I need to determine which version of the average appears to be more\npowerful for the particular stock or index that I am evaluating. Some stocks may\nﬁnd support or resistance at the SMA, and some at the EMA, or both. There-\nfore, it certainly doesn’t hurt to plot both versions in the chart window.\nSupport and Resistance\n187\nIf plotting both an SMA and an EMA of the same length, I recommend\nassigning the same color for each but identifying one with a solid line\nand one with a dashed or dotted line. For instance, I use dark green for\na 50-period moving average (against a white chart background) and\npurple for a 200-period. The SMA is assigned a solid line because it is\neasy to remember that they both start with the letter “s” (simple equals\nsolid). The EMA is plotted as a dotted line.\nSmart Investor Tip\n",

The candlestick reversal patterns\nmay be used by traders in several ways, including the following:\n• Trading opportunities. Traders may initiate trades based solely on the\npresence of a candlestick pattern.\n• Reinforce another setup. Traders may look for candlestick signals that\nform in conjunction with larger price setups, or where price is testing\nsupport or resistance.\n• Warning to take proﬁts. Traders may interpret a reversal pattern as a\nwarning to exit an open position, or at least take a defensive stance.\nThis chapter will address these uses for the reversal signals, as well as provide\nsome suggestions for ﬁnding patterns and controlling risk to your capital. In-depth\ninstruction on risk management and trade management is beyond the scope of this\nbook.

If you\nare not sure what stocks to evaluate, select some symbols from the S&P 500 In-\ndex component list included in Appendix B. Focus primarily on the turning\npoints (peaks and bottoms) on a chart and you’ll locate reversal patterns. If a\nchart is messy and hard to decipher, just skip past it. When you locate a reversal\npattern, make note of the surrounding chart landscape. Did the pattern form at\na support or resistance area? Did the stochastic oscillator conﬁrm the signal?\nWas it an ideal reversal pattern, or was it a nonideal pattern or variation? Was a\nstrong reversal pattern, such as an engulﬁng pattern or a hammer, accompanied\nby heavy volume? Eventually, it will not only be very easy for you to recognize\nthe reversal patterns, but you’ll learn to look for supporting Western technical\noccurrences that assist you in determining which signals are most likely to fol-\nlow through. Once you are able to recognize the patterns, you can determine\nhow you’ll implement them in your trading.\nAs part of your analysis, don’t forget about the bigger picture.

      "text": "Reversal Patterns Provide Trading\nOpportunities\nThe candlestick reversal patterns can be utilized for trade setups. Recall that a\nsetup is an identiﬁable price formation that presents a potentially proﬁtable\ntrading opportunity. Among the numerous setups for traders to choose from are\ncandlestick patterns. A strategy is the method a trader uses to trade a setup.\nSome traders may wish to devise a strategy for trading one or more of the can-\ndlestick reversal patterns. Bullish reversal patterns can be used to initiate long\npositions, and bearish patterns for short positions.\nTraders cannot be certain that a candlestick pattern is present until the\nclose of the trading session. Therefore, if trading a candlestick signal, a position\nmay be entered very near the end of the session on the signal day, or after the\nopen of the following session. As indicated in Chapter 3, for some reversal pat-\nterns it is best to wait for conﬁrmation before entering a position. Make sure to\ncarefully review the criteria and psychology of each candlestick pattern you wish\nto trade.\nSearching for Reversal Patterns\nFor centuries, the Japanese did not have the aid of computers for chart analysis.\nThey fared quite well using a trained eye to ﬁnd the formations on charts that\nwere drawn by hand. Of course, that was before the days when there were thou-\nsands of stocks available to trade.\nIf you trade a single instrument, such as the S&P e-mini, or a limited\nnumber of stocks, you won’t need to run computerized scans to ﬁnd reversal\npatterns. Patterns can be located simply by evaluating the charts. In fact, it\nwould be beneﬁcial to recognize and understand all of the reversal patterns pre-\nsented in Chapter 3 in order to expand the trading opportunities rather than\nwaiting for just one speciﬁc pattern to form.\nSome traders may prefer to trade one or more speciﬁc candlestick pat-\nterns. In that case, they’ll need to ﬂush out the stocks that meet the pattern’s cri-\nteria so they can choose good-looking setups from among them. There are\ncurrently about 7,000 stocks traded on the three major U.S. exchanges: the\nNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the American Stock Exchange (AMEX),\nand the Nasdaq. Traders who wish to ﬁnd a particular reversal pattern among\nhundreds or thousands of stocks can save a tremendous amount of time by al-\nlowing the computer to do most of the work.\nComputerized Screening\nThe ever-increasing power and speed of personal\ncomputers has made searching for candlestick patterns easy.

For instance, TeleChart users\ncan create Personal Criteria Formulas (PCFs) for the patterns. The PCFs can\nthen be used to sort or scan for stocks that meet the pattern’s criteria.\nFortunately, the criteria of all the patterns have already been deﬁned by\ntraders who were generous enough to share that information with others.\nTeleChart users can access www.tradeon.com, a free web site, to obtain the for-\nmulas for candlesticks.

Therefore, no more than $10,000 could be used to purchase one\nstock and the trader could purchase up to ﬁve stocks in this account (or more if\nless than $10,000 is committed per stock). Personally, I don’t typically buy a\nstock that I cannot afford at least 200 shares of, but at a minimum, I’d recom-\nmend ﬁguring for no less than 100 shares (less than 100 shares is referred to as\nan odd lot). Divide $10,000 by 100 shares for a maximum price per share of\n$100, or divide $10,000 by 200 shares for a maximum of $50 per share. Next,\ndetermine the minimum share price. For instance, many traders elect to trade\nstocks that are $5 per share or higher because stocks below $5 may not be mar-\nginable. Using these parameters, the price range would be $5 to $50 if you wish\nto trade a minimum of 200 shares, or $5 to $100 for a minimum of 100 shares.\nThink of the model outlined above as trading within the means of your\naccount. Most aspiring traders who do not succeed in this business fail due to\npoor risk and money management methods. Diversiﬁcation and position sizing\nare two very important factors to consider.\n204\nEAST MEETS WEST\nGoogle (GOOG) is currently trading above $500 per share. Buying\nshares of Google could tie up a substantial amount of capital, which\nmay not be a challenge for a large account, but could be problematic for\na smaller account. Trader A would have to invest his entire account of\n$50,000 in Google just to buy 100 shares. That would be an error in\njudgment, as the account would be over-allocated to one stock. If\nGoogle got unexpected news one evening and dropped 10 percent the\nnext day, Trader A’s entire account would be drawn down by 10 percent.\nHowever, if Trader A limited the purchase of one stock to 20 percent of\nthe account, and the stock fell 10 percent, the trader’s account would be\ndrawn down by only 2 percent. In addition, implementing a rule for\ndiversiﬁcation will keep him focused on stocks that are priced\nappropriately for the account size.\nExample\nTrader B has a larger account of $250,000. Putting 20 percent, or\n$50,000, into one stock would mean lot more exposure in one company. Trader\nB should break her account down further, for example, into 10 blocks of\n$25,000 or 15 blocks of approximately $16,500. That means managing more\ntrades in order to get the account fully invested—that is a “quality problem”!\nThere are different schools of thought on the best way to determine posi-\ntion sizing and for diversifying one’s account.

A computer cannot look across the chart land-\nscape and see where areas of support and resistance lie that may help or hinder a\nstock’s movement. It cannot spot a divergence, nor can it tell you whether there\nis an adequate reward-to-risk ratio to justify a trade. A computer can only nar-\nrow down a large list of stocks to a much smaller list of potential trade opportu-\nnities. After that, it is up to you to review that list, making a visual inspection of\neach chart, and further reducing the number of stocks to only those that merit\nthe commitment of your funds.\nAnother challenge with computerized screening is that a nonideal pattern,\nor a slight variation of a pattern, may be excluded because it falls short of meet-\ning the requirements designated in the formula. Remember that nonideal pat-\nterns and variations can be just as strong as some ideal patterns when considered\nin the context of the surrounding price action.\nReward versus Risk\nIn Chapter 3, reference was made in regard to several of the reversal patterns that,\nby the time the signal is apparent, there may not be an adequate reward-to-risk ra-\ntio to justify a trade. The reward versus the risk should be considered before entering\na trade, regardless of whether it is a candlestick pattern or some other price setup. If\nthe potential reward does not outweigh the risk involved by a sufﬁcient amount, a\ntrader should pass on the trade or wait for a better entry opportunity to set up.\nThe reward is the potential proﬁt on the trade. It is the gain that a trader\nwill recognize if a trade moves from the entry price to an exit point he has de-\ntermined based on analysis of the chart. That exit point is referred to as the tar-\nget or price objective.\nThe risk for a trade is the amount of money that will be lost if the trade\ndoes not follow through as anticipated. It is the distance from the entry price to\nthe point where the trader has determined that the position will be exited be-\ncause it has failed. The failure point is where the initial protective stop-loss or-\nder would be placed.\nThe reward compared to the risk is often referenced as a ratio. To calculate\nthe reward-to-risk ratio, simply divide the amount of potential reward by the\namount of potential risk. For example, if the distance to the target is four\npoints, and the distance to the protective stop is two points, the reward-to-risk\nratio is 2. There is twice as much potential reward as risk. A ratio of 1 means\nthat the potential risk is as great as the potential gain—that is a poor ratio. The\nhigher the reward-to-risk ratio, the better the trading opportunity. I suggest al-\nways trying to select trade setups that will net at least twice as much potential\ngain as loss. And ideally, that ratio will be 3:1 or better on many trades.\nPutting Candlestick Reversal Patterns to Work\n207\n",

For example, a bullish candlestick reversal pattern may form the\nsecond bottom of a larger Western double bottom pattern as shown in several\nexamples throughout this book.  I refer to these setups as a “pattern within a\npattern.” This is one of the uses for candlestick patterns that I favor.\nThe presence of a candlestick pattern within a larger pattern, such as the\nhammer that formed the potential double bottom in the STJ example (Figure\n10.6), provides an opportunity for an assertive entry into a long position for\ntraders who prefer not to wait for the larger double bottom pattern to conﬁrm.\n(For a double bottom to conﬁrm, price must close above the peak between the\ntwo bottoms.) Bottoming patterns often form as a long downtrend is coming to\nan end, or at that completion of a correction of a long-term uptrend, and vice\nversa for topping patterns. Traders wishing to get aboard a new trend, or a re-\nsumption of the trend, as early as possible, may favor setups such as the STJ ex-\nample. Protective stops should be used to limit loss in the event the bottoming\npattern is not successful at reversing the trend.\nSupport and Resistance\nAnother application for the candlestick reversal patterns is to choose setups that\nform at support (bullish patterns) or resistance (bearish patterns). As discussed in\nChapter 9, price often ﬁnds support (or resistance) at prior price peaks and bot-\ntoms, strong moving averages, and at the beginning of a gap window. \nSome traders (myself included) may feel more comfortable entering bull-\nish patterns, such as those shown in the FLR example (Figure 10.7), where\nthere is support below rather than if they form during a decline in which there\nis no visible support that will attract the attention of market participants. This\napproach works well for swing trading strategies, but also can be employed for\nentry into longer-term positions.\n210\nEAST MEETS WEST\n",

This is especially helpful for swing traders\nwho hold positions for a few days to a few weeks. Rather than holding on as the\nmarket zigs and zigs like a longer-term investor may do, the swing trader ex-\nploits the short-term moves within a trend.\nCandlestick reversal signals can be used to exit a trade, or at least take a\ndefensive stance, for those who do not wish to hold through a potential pull-\nback or period of consolidation. Swing traders holding long positions should\nwatch for bearish reversal signals. Those holding short positions should watch\nfor bullish reversal signals.\nA challenge with utilizing the reversal signals in this manner is that you\nwon’t know until the close of the trading session that the pattern is present. As\ndiscussed in Chapters 2 and 4, the candlestick can change shape throughout the\nsession so a close is necessary in order to identify the pattern. For some reversal\npatterns, that means price may have moved signiﬁcantly against your position\nby the session’s end (for example, a dark cloud cover or an engulﬁng pattern) as\nyou wait to see how the candle looks by the end of the session.

By the end of the session, it won’t matter if a strong reversal\ncandlestick pattern has formed because you’ll have used the gap to exit early in\nthe day. Another option is to lighten up by selling part of the position on the\nopening gap (or in pre-market trading) and maintain a protective stop on the\nbalance of the position.\nShort Selling\nSeveral times in this book you’ve seen reference to “shorting” a stock.

Therefore, short selling is not allowed in tax-deferred\nretirement accounts because they are nonmargin accounts.\nUntil recently, there was an uptick rule for shorting\nstocks. That meant price must trade higher than the last\nprice before an order to sell short could be ﬁlled. The rule,\nwhich was implemented by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) back in the 1930s in order to curtail a\nbear raid on a stock, was eliminated in July 2007.\nNovice traders often shy away from shorting due\nto lack of understanding and a sense that it is a risky\npractice. Some traders cite the concern that there is\nno limit to how high the stock’s price could rise, thus\nsetting up the potential for unlimited loss. However,\ntraders should not ﬁnd themselves in this position if\nthey implement proper risk and money management\nrules. It is not the practice of shorting that is risky,\nbut rather the actions of the trader who fails to\nmargin\naccount\nA brokerage\naccount that\npermits an\ninvestor to buy\nor sell\nsecurities on\ncredit and to\nborrow against\nsecurities held\nin the account.\n",

A protective stop-loss order for a\nlong position is called a sell stop. It is placed below the current price at a level\nwhere the trader would no longer wish to hold a position in that stock. For\na short position, a buy stop (or buy-to-cover stop) is placed above the cur-\nrent price at a level where the trader would no longer wish to be short the\nstock.\nShort selling offers traders the opportunity to take advantage of a de-\nclining market. I once heard it said that “the bull walks up the stairway but\nthe bear jumps out the window.” This is a clever way of saying that prices\ntend to fall faster than they rise. Experienced traders can proﬁt handsomely in\na down market.

The ﬁrst inverse ETFs introduced correspond to\nthe major averages. Traders have a choice of short or ultra-\nshort ETFs. The ultra-short ETFs are designed to double\nthe performance of the index.

Volume bars\nwith a 30-day simple moving average of volume, and the stochastic oscillator\n(12-3-3 setting), are plotted in the panels below each chart example to assist\nwith your analysis. Once you have ﬁnished evaluating each chart, compare your\nanalysis to the commentary at the end of the chapter to see the author’s perspec-\ntive of the same set of charts.\nThe goal of this exercise is to guide you toward the signiﬁcant technical\noccurrences on the charts so that you can condition what you have learned. Nu-\nmerous technical incidents may occur on a daily chart over a period of a few\nmonths or more. Not every single event on every chart  (Figures 11.9 through\n11.11) was singled out, so you may observe some technical events that are not\nnumbered.

I am not trying to discourage you from\nlearning as much as you can about this industry—quite the contrary. Even af-\nter years of study and practice, I am amazed at how there is always something\nnew to be learned.

It has a small real body that forms at, or very\nnear, the upper end of the candlestick’s range. The small real body\nmay be either black or white. There should be no upper shadow or a\nvery small one. The long lower shadow is typically two or more\ntimes the length of the real body. A hanging man may appear after a\nshort-term upward move, but it is more signiﬁcant if it appears after a long or\nsharp rally or at an all-time high.\nShooting star: This bearish counterpart to the inverted ham-\nmer forms after a price advance. It has a small real body that forms\nat, or very near, the lower end of the candlestick’s range. The small\nreal body may be either black or white. There should be no lower\nshadow or a very small one. The long upper shadow is typically two\nor more times the length of the real body. An ideal pattern will have\na real body that gaps up open away from the prior real body. It is acceptable,\nthough, for the real body of the shooting star to overlap the prior candle’s real\nbody.\nDoji (northern): This bearish counterpart to the southern\ndoji forms after a price advance. The opening and closing prices are\nthe same, or very near the same, meaning it has no real body. The\nlength of its upper and lower shadows may vary.

      "text": "Bullish Reversal Patterns\nHammer: This bullish counterpart to the hanging man forms\nafter a price decline. It has a small real body that forms at, or very\nnear, the upper end of the candlestick’s range. The small real body\nmay be either black or white. There should be no upper shadow or a\nvery small one. The long lower shadow is typically two or more\ntimes the length of the real body. The hammer is a strong reversal\nsignal. It is meaningful whether it forms after a short-term downside\nmove or after a more signiﬁcant decline.\nInverted hammer: This bullish counterpart to the shooting\nstar forms after a price decline. It has a small real body that forms at,\nor very near, the lower end of the candlestick’s range. The small real\nbody may be either black or white. There should be no lower\nshadow or a very small one. The long upper shadow is typically two\nor more times the length of the real body.\nDoji (southern): This bullish counterpart to the northern doji\nforms after a price decline. The opening and closing prices are the\nsame, or very near the same, meaning it has no real body. The length\nof its upper and lower shadows may vary. A doji that appears after a\ndownward move may result in a change in price direction; however,\ndoji tend to lose some of their potency in a declining market. The\nsouthern doji is often a component of other bullish patterns, such as\nthe morning doji star and the bullish harami cross.\nPiercing pattern: This bullish counterpart to the\ndark cloud cover pattern forms after a price decline. It is\nformed from two candlestick lines of opposite color. The\nﬁrst candle has a strong black real body. The second candle\nhas a white real body. Price gaps down open below the prior\ncandle’s low and closes deeply (at least halfway) into the\nprior candle’s black real body. The deeper the second can-\ndle’s bullish real body penetrates the prior candle’s bearish\nreal body, the stronger the signal.\nBullish engulﬁng: This bullish counterpart to the\nbearish engulﬁng pattern forms after a price decline. It is\nformed from two candlestick lines of opposite color. The\nﬁrst candle has a black real body. The second candle has a\nlonger white real body that completely surrounds the prior\ncandle’s black real body.
