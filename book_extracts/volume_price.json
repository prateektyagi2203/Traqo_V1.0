      "text": "Table of Contents\nForeward\nAn introduction to Volume Price Analysis and how it all began for me. I was one of the lucky traders who began\nmy own journey in trading based on volume. It has been the cornerstone of my success and I want it to be yours\nas well. This is why I wrote the book. To help you, achieve your own personal ambitions through trading.\nVolume Price Analysis is the ONLY way to reveal the secrets of the market and in doing so, follow the ‘smart\nmoney’.\nChapter One : There’s Nothing New In Trading\nIf you thought that Volume Price Analysis was a new concept. Think again. This was the approach used by the\niconic traders of the past, such as Charles Dow, Jesse Livermore, and Richard Wyckoff. These traders built\nhuge fortunes using this technique, using nothing more than the ticker tape, pencil and paper. Here I explain\nhow they achieved their success, and how little the concepts have changed in over a 100 years.\nChapter Two : Why Volume\nNot an unreasonable question. In this chapter I explain why volume is the ONLY leading indicator, which when\ncombined with price, truly reveals the future direction of the market. In addition, volume reveals something\nEQUALLY important. Whether the price action is valid or false.\nChapter Three : The Right Price\nThe second component which then creates the explosive combination, of VPA. Price on its own simply reveals\nthe buying and the selling. What it never reveals is the extent of any future price move, and more importantly\nwhether that price move is a fake move.\nChapter Four : Volume Price Analysis - First Principles\nHere I introduce the basic building blocks of Volume Price Analysis. In simple terms we are really only looking\nfor one of two things in our analysis. Either a confirmation that volume and price are in agreement, or an\nanomaly, where volume and price do NOT agree. This is then our first warning signal of a possible change.\nChapter Five : Volume Price Analysis - Building The Picture\nIn this chapter I explain the concepts of accumulation and distribution which underpin Volume Price Analysis.\nThese occur in all time frames and in all markets and are rounded off with the firework display, which is the\nselling or buying climax. This marks the end of the campaign and the start of a new trend. All we have to do, is\nfollow the insiders, and buy and sell, when they are buying and selling. In this chapter you will discover how to\nsee this for yourself in any market.\nChapter Six : Volume Price Analysis - The Next Level\nHere we start to build on the concepts from the previous chapter and begin to look at VPA in action using the\nthree most powerful candles. In addition I explain stopping volume and topping out volume, as we start to build\nour VPA knowledge into a complete approach to market analysis.\nChapter Seven : Support And Resistance Explained\nSupport and resistance is one of the cornerstones of technical trading. Yet when combined with volume, this\nessential technique becomes even more powerful. Few traders ever discover how to identify when the markets\nare moving into a congestion phase, or equally important to validate when they are breaking out. In this chapter\nyou will discover both!\nChapter Eight : Dynamic Trends And Trend Lines\nForget traditional trend and trend lines. By the time these are developed you are just getting in when the smart\nmoney is getting out! In this chapter you will learn how to create dynamic trend lines, which when coupled with\nVPA get you in at the start of the trend, and NOT at the end. If you have ever struggled with the concept of\ntraditional trend theory, this is for you and will revolutionize your trading.\nChapter Nine : Volume At Price (VAP)\n",

Volume at price of VAP is something entirely different, and which\ngives you a visual and instant picture of the density of volumes at price levels on the chart. This is so powerful,\nit’s amazing more traders don’t use this approach. After all, a breakout from one of these regions means one\nthing - a new trend! And when confirmed with VPA - money!\nChapter Ten : Volume Price Analysis Examples\nHere we examine some ‘worked’ examples across various markets in detail. See VPA applied to stocks in the\ncash markets, currencies in the spot FX market, indices in the futures markets and commodities using tick\ncharts. In fact virtually every market and type of chart from tick to time based charts, all detailed and annotated\nfor you. If you still need to be convinced, I hope this chapter will do it for you!\nChapter Eleven : Putting It All Together\nNow it’s time to pull all the elements together. In addition I explain some of the most powerful congestion\npatterns which have worked consistently over 16 years of trading, and when combined with volume, give us\nsimple and clear trading opportunities - provided you can be patient!\nChapter Twelve : Volume And Price - The Next Generation\nIn the final chapter I introduce some of the latest developments in Volume Price Analysis, and where this\nmethodology may go in the future. Charles Dow and the other iconic traders of the past would love these\nextensions of their original work.\nAcknowledgments & Trader Resources\nList of the chart providers used in this book along with details of free resources for traders.\n",

      "text": "Foreward\nThis is the best of times for those willing to study, learn quickly, work hard … learn from the past to succeed in\nthe future.\nRobert Kiyosaki (1947-)\nThis is a very personal book for me, and one I have been planning to write for many years.\nFinally I have found the time to write it!\nI hope, that once you have read it, the single analytical trading technique I am going to share with you, will have\nas profound an effect on your trading, as it has had on mine. I stumbled on this methodology many years ago, in\nan almost surreal way, when I first became interested in trading. And I am eternally grateful that I did, even\nthough, as you will see, it cost me a great deal of money at the time. Learning this method, was a defining\nmoment in my life and trading career. I hope that this book will be equally life changing for you too.\nSo what is this trading technique and what makes it so special? Well, it's been around for over 100 years, and\nwas used by all the iconic traders of the past. Despite this heritage, many traders today, ignore (or are unaware)\nof this immensely effective analytical method. Why this is, I have no idea. It has been the cornerstone of my own\ntrading and investing for over 16 years, and remains so today. It is immensely powerful, and in many ways 'just\nmakes sense'. My purpose in writing this book is to convince you to embrace this for yourself.\nAll I ask is that you open your mind, and accept the simple logic and power of what I refer to as Volume Price\nAnalysis, or VPA for short.\nVolume Price Analysis is my own terminology. You will not find this description anywhere else. The reason I\nuse it, is that it precisely describes the methodology in three simple words. After all, as traders, there is only one\nquestion we want answered with some degree of certainty, every time we trade. The question is 'where is the\nprice going next.’\nVolume Price Analysis will answer this question for you.\nIt can be applied to all markets in all time frames, and can be used to trade all instruments. Using volume to\nvalidate and forecast future price action, has been at the heart of my trading success, and I hope that in reading\nthis book, it will change your approach to trading forever. As I said earlier, please just open your mind to the\nsimple logic that is VPA, and once you have read this book, you will be able to interpret charts, and forecast\nprice action, instantly.\nThe first time this happens will be a life changing moment for you, as you suddenly realise that you have the\nmost powerful trading technique at your finger tips.\nAs a trader you will become confident and calm, as your trading decisions will be based on logic, and on your\nown analysis of the price volume relationship. However, as I said earlier, there is nothing new or mystical here.\nThe methodology you will discover is grounded in the approach used by the iconic traders of the past. For them,\nthere were no computers or the internet. Everything was done manually, with hand drawn charts, and price\nreading from a paper tape. We are lucky. All this is now done for us, on an electronic chart. All we have to do is\ninterpret the price volume relationship, and to do that you need a good teacher.\nI hope to be that teacher, and deliver the lessons in this book.\nHowever, how did I stumble on volume, and its symbiotic and interdependent relationship price? Well, it is a\nrather odd story, and in relating it, I hope it will become apparent, that even though it was hugely expensive, in\nhindsight I know I have been lucky, because I started my trading journey with volume. Many traders spend\nyears trying different trading approaches, becoming increasingly disillusioned as each one fails to live up to the\nexpectations of the marketing hype, before arriving at the same conclusion.\nIt is only in hindsight I can appreciate how extremely fortunate I have been, and now I want to share this\nknowledge with you. So, if you are reading this book as a novice trader, then you too are lucky. You have\navoided the pain and expense of a long, fruitless journey. If you are a seasoned trader, welcome to this book\n",

      "text": "and I hope that it fulfils your expectations, and that you have enough enthusiasm left for reading just one more\nbook about trading!\nIn telling my story here, I have not changed any of the names, and many of these people are still involved in the\ntrading world.\nHow It All Started\nIn the late 1990’s I couldn’t understand why my pension and investments did not reflect what was happening in\nthe stock market, which was extremely bullish. In these dark days before the internet I could only rely on\nnewspapers, and it was in January 1998 that I read an article in the Sunday Times about a trader who had\nmade significant sums from trading, and was now looking for recruits to train in his methods. That trader’s name\nwas Albert Labos.\nTwo weeks later, on an early Sunday morning, I joined hundreds of other hopefuls in a packed room, on the\nHMS President. The President is a famous anti-submarine Q-ship completed in 1918 moored on the River\nThames close to Blackfriars Bridge. I arrived, cheque book in hand, ready to sign up to whatever was on offer.\nThe event was shrouded in mystery from the start. First, Albert exhorted the 'spies' in the room to leave. He\nknew who they were and why they were there, and as he told us later, these were spies from the major banks,\ncome to learn his secret trading techniques. These were trading techniques which could take on the cartel,\ncurrently enjoyed by these market makers.\nWe were then introduced to a Tom Williams. We were told that Tom was partially sighted, and I can’t quite\nremember if he had a white cane. We were also told that Tom was an ex ‘syndicate trader’. However, to this day\nI am not entirely certain what a ‘syndicate trader’ is or does. But at the time it sounded very impressive. Various\ncharts were presented during the pitch and all the while Albert explained he was searching for an elite group of\ntraders. However, spaces were limited and only a select few would be taken and trained.\nLike many others there I wanted to join, and happily paid my £5,000 for a two week course, grateful to have\nbeen accepted for this ‘once in a lifetime opportunity’.\nIf all the above sounds slightly bizarre, it was, but I felt confident because Albert had been endorsed by a very\nreputable newspaper, and I was anxious to learn.\nDuring the two week course we had to write an essay and we were encouraged to read Reminiscences of a\nStock Operator by Edwin Lefevre, which is a thinly disguised biography of Jesse Livermore. A book all traders\nand investors should read.\nThroughout the two weeks, the over-riding message was that all financial markets are manipulated in one way\nor another. And the only way to know whether a price move was genuine or false was by using volume. Volume\ncannot be hidden. It is there for everyone to see.\nI was so convinced by the volume story that I also persuaded my husband, David to take Albert’s course.\nWith hindsight the costs were outrageous as the course could have been condensed into a couple of days.\nHowever, David and I took the basic principles of price and volume and since then, have integrated them into\nour own trading and investing methodology. In the intervening years, we have successfully traded virtually\nevery market, and for the past five years have shared our knowledge and experience across our network of 70\nwebsites.\nThis book now gives us the opportunity to pass on this knowledge in more detail to the next generation of\ntraders and investors, of which I hope you will be one.\n",

      "text": "Chapter One\nThere's Nothing New in Trading\nNihil sub sole (there is nothing new under the sun)\nEcclesiastes 1:9\nLet me start if I may with a book I have read, many, many times, and was the 'course book' recommended to us\nby Albert as we sat, innocent and expectant on that first morning, clutching this book in our hands.\nThe book in question was Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, written by Edwin Lefevre and published in 1923.\nIt is an autobiography of one of the iconic traders of the past, Jesse Livermore, and is as relevant today, as it\nwas then. But one quote in particular stands out for me, and it is this:\n“there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever\nhappens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again”\nThis in essence sums up volume, and Volume Price Analysis. If you are expecting some new and exciting\napproach to trading, you will be disappointed. The foundations of Volume Price Analysis are so deeply rooted\nin the financial markets, that it is extraordinary to me how few traders accept the logic of what we see every day.\nIt is a technique which has been around for over 100 years. It was the foundation stone on which huge personal\nfortunes were created, and iconic institutions built.\nNow at this point you may be asking yourself three questions:\n \n1. Is volume still relevant today?\n2. Is it relevant to the market I trade?\n3. Can it be applied to all trading and investing strategies?\nLet me try to answer the first if I can with an extract from Stocks and Commodities magazine. The following\nquote was by David Penn, a staff writer at the time for the magazine, who wrote the following about Wykcoff in\nan article in 2002:\n“Many of Wyckoff’s basic tenets have become de facto standards of technical analysis: The concepts of\naccumulation/distribution and the supremacy of price and volume in determining stock price movement are\nexamples.”\nThe second question, I can only answer from a personal perspective.\nI began my own trading career in the futures market trading indices. From there I moved into the cash markets\nfor investing, commodities for speculating, and finally into the currency markets in both futures and spot. In all of\nthese, I have used volume and price as my primary analytical approach to each of these markets, even spot\nforex. And yes, there is volume in forex as well! Volume Price Analysis can be applied to each and every\nmarket. The approach is universal. Once learnt you will be able to apply this methodology to any time frame and\nto every instrument.\nFinally, the best way to answer the third question of whether Volume Price Analysis can be applied to all\ntrading and investing strategies, is with a quotation from Richard Wyckoff who, as you will find out shortly, is the\nfounding father of Volume Price Analysis. He wrote the following in his book 'Studies in Tape Reading'\n“In judging the market by its own actions, it is unimportant whether you are endeavouring to forecast the next\nsmall half hourly swing, or the trend for the next two or three weeks. The same indications as to price, volume,\nactivity, support, and pressure are exhibited in the preparation for both. The same elements will be found in a\ndrop of water as in the ocean, and vice versa”\nSo the simple truth is this. Regardless of whether you are scalping as a speculator in stocks, bonds, currencies\n",

      "text": "and equities, or you are trend, swing, or position trader in these markets, or even investing for the longer term,\nthe techniques you will discover here are as valid today as they were almost 100 years ago. The only proviso is\nthat we have price and volume on the same chart.\nFor this powerful technique we have to thank the great traders of the last century, who laid the foundations of\nwhat we call technical analysis today. Iconic names such as Charles Dow, founder of the Dow Jones, Dow\nTheory and the Wall Street Journal, and generally referred to as the grandfather of technical analysis.\nOne of Dow's principle beliefs was that volume confirmed trends in price. He maintained that if a price was\nmoving on low volume, then there could be many different reasons. However, when a price move was\nassociated with high or rising volume, then he believed this was a valid move. If the price continued moving in\none direction, and with associated supporting volume, then this was the signal of the start of a trend.\nFrom this basic principle, Charles Dow then extended and developed this idea to the three principle stages of a\ntrend. He defined the first stage of a bullish trend as, ‘the accumulation phase’, the starting point for any trend\nhigher. He called the second stage ‘the public participation phase’ which could be considered the technical\ntrend following stage. This was usually the longest of the three phases. Finally, he identified the third stage,\nwhich he called ‘the distribution phase’. This would typically see investors rushing into the market, terrified that\nthey were missing out on a golden opportunity.\nWhilst the public were happily buying, what Charles Dow called ‘the smart money’, were doing the exact\nopposite, and selling. The smart money was taking its profits and selling to an increasingly eager public. And all\nof this buying and selling activity could all be seen through the prism of volume.\nCharles Dow himself, never published any formal works on his approach to trading and investing, preferring to\npublish his thoughts and ideas in the embryonic Wall Street Journal. It was only after his death in 1902, that his\nwork was collated and published, first by close friend and colleague Sam Nelson, and later by William\nHamilton. The book published in 1903, entitled The ABC of Stock Speculation was the first to use the term 'Dow\nTheory', a hook on which to hang the great man's ideas.\nWhilst volume was one of the central tenets of his approach to the market, and consequent validation of the\nassociated price action, it was the development of the idea of trends, which was one of the driving principle for\nCharles Dow. The other was the concept of indices to give investors an alternative view of the fundamentals of\nmarket behaviour with which to validate price. This was the reason he developed the various indices such as\nthe Dow Jones Transportation Index, to provide a benchmark against which ‘related industrial sectors’ could\nprovide a view of the broader economy.\nAfter all, if the economy were strong, then this would be reflected in the performance of companies in different\nsectors of the market. An early exponent of cross market analysis if you like!\nIf Charles Dow was the founding father of technical analysis, it was a contemporary of his, Richard Wyckoff,\nwho could be considered to be the founding father of volume and price analysis, and who created the building\nblocks of the methodology that we use today.\nWyckoff was a contemporary of Dow, and started work on Wall Street as a stock runner at the age of 15 in 1888,\nat much the same time as Dow was launching his first edition of the Wall Street Journal. By the time he was 25\nhe had made enough money from his trading to open his own brokerage office. Unusually, not with the primary\ngoal of making more money for himself (which he did), but as an educator and source of unbiased information\nfor the small investor. This was a tenet throughout this life, and unlike Charles Dow, Wyckoff was a prolific\nwriter and publisher.\nHis seminal work, The Richard Wyckoff Method of Trading and Investing in Stocks, first published in the early\n1930’s, as a correspondence course, remains the blueprint which all Wall Street investment banks still use\ntoday. It is essentially a course of instruction, and although hard to find, is still available in a hard copy version\nfrom vintage booksellers.\nThroughout his life, Wyckoff was always keen to ensure that the self directed investor was given an insight into\nhow the markets actually worked, and in 1907 launched a hugely successful monthly magazine called The\nTicker, later merged into The Magazine of Wall Street, which became even more popular. One of the many\nreasons for this was his view of the market and market behaviour. First, he firmly believed that to be successful\n",

      "text": "you needed to do you own technical analysis, and ignore the views of the ‘so called’ experts and the financial\nmedia. Second, he believed that this approach was an art, and not a science.\nThe message that Wyckoff relayed to his readers, and to those who attended his courses and seminars was a\nsimple one. Through his years of studying the markets and in working on Wall Street he believed that prices\nmoved on the basic economic principle of supply and demand, and that by observing the price volume\nrelationship, it was possible to forecast future market direction.\nLike Charles Dow and Jesse Livermore, who Wyckoff interviewed many times and subsequently published in\nthe Magazine of Wall Street, all these greats from the past, had one thing in common. They all used the the\nticker tape, as the source of their inspiration, revealing as it did, the basic laws of supply and demand with price,\nvolume, time and trend at its heart.\nFrom his work, Wyckoff detailed three basic laws.\n1.The Law of Supply and Demand\nThis was his first and basic law, borne out of his experience as a broker with a detailed inside knowledge of\nhow the markets react to the ongoing battle of price action, minute by minute and bar by bar. When demand is\ngreater than supply, then prices will rise to meet this demand, and conversely when supply is greater then\ndemand then prices will fall, with the over supply being absorbed as a result.\nConsider the winter sales! Prices fall and the buyers come in to absorb over supply.\n2.The Law of Cause and Effect\nThe second law states that in order to have an effect, you must first have a cause, and furthermore, the effect\nwill be in direct proportion to the cause. In other words, a small amount of volume activity will only result in a\nsmall amount of price action. This law is applied to a number of price bars and will dictate the extent of any\nsubsequent trend. If the cause is large, then the effect will be large as well. If the cause is small, then the effect\nwill also be small.\nThe simplest analogy here is of a wave at sea. A large wave hitting a vessel will see the ship roll violently,\nwhereas a small wave would have little or no effect.\n3.The Law of Effort vs Result\nThis is Wyckoff's third law which is similar to Newton's third law of physics. Every action must have an equal\nand opposite reaction. In other words, the price action on the chart must reflect the volume action below. The\ntwo should always be in harmony with one another, with the effort ( which is the volume ) seen as the result (\nwhich is the consequent price action ). This is where, as Wyckoff taught, we start to analyse each price bar,\nusing a ‘forensic approach’, to discover whether this law has been maintained. If it has, then the market is\nbehaving as it should, and we can continue our analysis on the following bar. If not, and there is an anomaly,\nthen we need to discover why, and just like a crime scene investigator, establish the reasons.\nThe Ticker described Wycoff's approach perfectly. Throughout his twenty years of studying the markets, and\ntalking to other great traders such as Jesse Livermore and J P Morgan, he had become one of the leading\nexponents of tape reading, and which subsequently formed the basis of his methodology and analysis. In 1910,\nhe wrote what is still considered to be the most authoritative book on tape reading entitled, Studies in Tape\nReading, not published under his own name, but using the pseudonym Rollo Tape!\nLivermore too was an arch exponent of tape reading, and is another of the all time legends of Wall Street. He\nbegan his trading career when he was 15, working as a quotation board boy, calling out the latest prices from\nthe ticker tape. These were then posted on the boards in the brokerage office of Paine and Webber where he\nworked. Whilst the job itself was boring, the young Jesse soon began to realise that the constant stream of\nprices, coupled with buy and sell orders was actually revealing a story. The tape was talking to him, and\nrevealing the inner most secrets of the market.\nHe began to notice that when a stock price behaved in a certain way with the buying and selling, then a\nsignificant price move was on the way. Armed with this knowledge, Livermore left the brokerage office and\nbegan to trade full time, using his intimate knowledge of the ticker tape. Within 2 years he had turned $1000 into\n$20,000, a huge sum in those days, and by the time he was 21, this had become, $200,000, earning him the\n",

      "text": "nickname of the 'Boy Plunger'\nFrom stocks he moved into commodities, where even larger sums followed, and despite a roller coaster ride,\nwhere he made and lost several million dollars, his fame was cemented in history with his short selling in two\nmajor market crashes. The first was in 1907, where he made over $3 million dollars. However, this gain was\ndwarfed in the Wall Street crash of 1929, where conservative estimates suggest he made around $100 million\ndollars. Whilst others suffered and lost everything, Jesse Livermore prospered, and at the time was vilified in the\npress and made a public scapegoat. No surprise given the tragedies that befell many.\nLivermore's own wife assumed that they had lost everything again, and had removed all the furniture and her\njewellery from their 23 bedroom house, fearing the arrival of the bailiffs at any moment. It was only when he\narrived home from his office that evening, he calmly announced to her that in fact this had been his most\nprofitable day of trading, ever.\nFor these iconic traders, the ticker tape was their window on the world of the financial markets. Wyckoff himself\nreferred to the ticker tape as a :-\n“method for forecasting from what appears on the tape now, what is likely to happen in the future”\nHe then went on to say later in ‘Studies in Tape Reading’ :-\n“ Tape Reading is rapid-fire horse sense. Its object is to determine whether stocks are being accumulated or\ndistributed, marked up or down, or whether they are neglected by the large interests. The Tape Reader aims to\nmake deductions from each succeeding transaction – every shift of the market kaleidoscope; to grasp a new\nsituation, force it, lightning-like, through the weighing machine of the brain, and to reach a decision which can\nbe acted upon with coolness and precision. It is gauging the momentary supply and demand in particular stocks\nand in the whole market, comparing the forces behind each and their relationship, each to the other and to all.\nA Tape Reader is like the manager of a department store; into his office are poured hundreds of reports of sales\nmade by various departments. He notes the general trend of business – whether demand is heavy or light\nthroughout the store – but lends special attention to the lines in which demand is abnormally strong or weak.\nWhen he finds difficulty in keeping his shelves full in a certain department, he instructs his buyers, and they\nincrease their buying orders; when certain goods do not move he knows there is little demand ( market ) for\nthen, therefore he lowers his prices as an inducement to possible purchasers.\nAs traders, surely this is all we need to know!\nOriginally developed in the mid 1860's as a telegraphic system for communicating using Morse code, the\ntechnology was adapted to provide a system for communicating stock prices and order flow.\nThese then appeared on a narrow paper tape which punched out the numbers throughout the trading day.\nBelow is an original example of what these great traders would have used to make their fortunes.\nHard to believe perhaps, but what appears here is virtually all you need to know as a trader to succeed, once\nyou understand the volume, price, trend and time relationship.\n",

      "text": "Fig 1.11 Ticker Tape Of Wall Street Crash\nThe image from Fig 1.11 is kindly provided from the resources of the Museum of American Finance where you\ncan see the original.\nOn the top line is the stock ticker, with companies such as Goodyear Tyre (GT), United States Steel (X), Radio\nCorporation (R) and Westinghouse Electric (WX), with the notation PR alongside to show where the stock\nbeing sold was Preferred, rather than Common stock.\nBelow on the second line were printed all the prices and trading volumes, all in a short hand form to try to speed\nup the process. The character ‘S’ was often used in the prices quoted, to show a break between the number of\nshares being traded and the price quoted, but having the same meaning as a dot on the tape. Where ‘SS’\nappeared, then this referred to an odd number of shares, generally less than 100. Finally, zeros were frequently\nleft off quotes, once again for speed. So if we take US Steel (X) as an example from the above we can see on\nthe first line of the ticker tape 10,000 shares at 185 ¾ and by the time we reach the end of the tape, the stock is\nbeing quoted as 2.5 ½. So 200 shares, but on such a day, was the price still 185, or had it fallen to 175 or even\n165, as many shares did.\nThis then was the tape, that all these iconic traders came to know and understand intimately. Once they had\nlearnt the language of the ticker, the tape had a story to tell, and one simply based on price and volume. For\ntheir longer term analysis, they would then transfer all this information across to a chart.\nWhat has changed since? Well, the honest answer is actually very little.\nWe are fortunate in that our charts are electronic. All the price action and volume is delivered to us second by\nsecond, tick by tick, but just to prove that the ticker and its significance still remain, below is a more modern\nversion of the same thing. The only difference is that this is electronic, but the information this portrays is the\nsame.\n",

What\nwe don't know at this stage is the time between these price changes, and whether the volumes for this\ninstrument are low, above average or high.

In this respect he was similar to Wyckoff, and as an educator saw his role of trying to help the small\ninvestor understand how the game was rigged on the inside.\nHis first book, The Wall Street Jungle was a New York Times best seller in 1970, and he followed this up with\n",

      "text": "two others, The Wall Street Gang and Making It In The Market. All had the same underlying theme, and to give\nyou a flavour let me quote from the forward by Senator Lee Metcalf to The Wall Street Gang\n“In his chapter on the SEC Mr Ney demonstrates an understanding of the esoteric operations of the Stock\nExchange. Operations are controlled for the benefits of the insiders who have the special information and the\nclout to profit from all sorts of transactions, regardless of the actual value of the stock traded. The investor is left\nout or is an extraneous factor. The actual value of the listed stock is irrelevant. The name of the game is\nmanipulation.”\nRemember, this is a Senator of the day, writing a forward to this book. No wonder Richard Ney was considered\na champion of the people.\nHis books are still available today and just as relevant. Why? Because everything that Richard Ney exposed in\nhis books, still goes on today, in every market, and let me say here and now, I am not writing from the standpoint\nof a conspiracy theorist. I am merely stating a fact of trading life. Every market that we either trade or invest in is\nmanipulated in one way or another. Whether covertly by the market makers in equities, or in forex by the central\nbanks who intervene regularly and in some cases very publicly.\nHowever, there is one activity that the insiders cannot hide and that is volume, which is why you are reading\nthis book. Volume reveals activity. Volume reveals the truth behind the price action. Volume validates price.\nLet me give you one final quote from The Wall Street Gang, which I hope will make the point, and also lead us\nneatly into the next chapter. From the chapter entitled “The Specialist's Use of the Short Sale”, Richard Ney\nsays the following :\n“To understand the specialists' practices, the investor must learn to think of specialists as merchants who want\nto sell an inventory of stock at retail price levels. When they clear their shelves of their inventory they will seek\nto employ their profits to buy more merchandise at wholesale price levels. Once we grasp this concept we are\nready to posit eight laws:\n \n1. As merchants, specialists will expect to sell at retail what they have bought at wholesale.\n2. The longer the specialists remain in business, the more money they will accumulate to buy stock at\nwholesale, which they will then want to sell at retail.\n3. The expansion of communications media will bring more people into the market, tending to increase\nvolatility of stock prices as they increase elements of demand-supply.\n4. In order to buy and sell huge quantities of stock, Exchange members will seek new ways to enhance their\nsales techniques through use of the mass media.\n5. In order to employ ever increasing financial resources, specialists will have to effect price declines of ever\nincreasing dimensions in order to shake out enough stock.\n6. Advances will have to be more dramatic on the upside to attract public interest in order to distribute the\never increasing accumulated inventories.\n7. The most active stocks will require longer periods of time for their distribution.\n8. The economy will be subjected to increasingly dramatic breakdowns causing inflation, unemployment,\nhigh interest rates and shortages of raw materials.\nSo wrote Richard Ney, who correctly called consecutive market tops and bottoms throughout the 1960’s 70’s\nand 80’s. He was the scourge of the SEC, and the champion of the small speculator and investor.\nTherefore, volume reveals the truth behind the numbers. Whether you are trading in manipulated markets such\nas stocks or forex, or ones such as futures where we are dealing with the major operators, volume reveals that\nmanipulation and order flow in stark detail.\nThe market makers in stocks cannot hide, the major banks who set exchange rates for the foreign exchange\n",

      "text": "as the NYSE, AMEX and the NASDAQ have specialists who act as market makers. These include firms such\nas Barclays plc (BARC) and Getco LLC that oversee the trading in shares and what is often referred to as The\nBig Board (shades of Jesse Livermore, perhaps). According to Bloomberg Business in 2012 ‘exchanges are\nexperimenting with ways of inducing market makers to quote more aggressively to attract volume’. In addition,\nin the same article the US exchanges are very keen to increase the number of companies who can act as\nmarket makers. But, other than this, not much has changed since the days of Richard Ney.\nDo these companies then work together? Of course they do! It goes without saying. Do they work in an overt\nway? No. What they will all see, is the balance of supply and demand in general across the markets and\nspecifically in their own stocks. If the specialists are all in a general state of over supply, and a news story\nprovides the opportunity to sell, then the market markers will all act pretty much in unison, as their warehouses\nwill all be in much the same state. It really is common sense once you start to think about the markets in this\nway.\nOn the London Stock Exchange there are official market makers for many securities (but not for shares in the\nlargest and most heavily traded companies, which instead use an electronic automated system called SETS).\nHowever, you might ask why I have spent so much time explaining what these companies do, when actually\nyou never see them at all. The answer is very simple. As the 'licensed insiders', they sit in the middle of the\nmarket, looking at both sides of the market. They will know precisely the balance of supply and demand at any\none time. Naturally this information will never be available to you, and if you were in their position, you would\nprobably take advantage in the same way.\nThe only tool we have at our disposal to fight back, is volume. We can argue about the rights and wrongs of the\nsituation, but when you are trading and investing in stocks, market makers are a fact of life. Just accept it, and\nmove on.\nVolume is far from perfect. The market makers have even learnt over the decades how to avoid reporting large\nmovements in stock, which are often reported in after hours trading. However, it is the best tool we have with\nwhich to see ' inside the market'\nVolume applies to all markets and is equally valuable, whether there is market manipulation or not. Volume in\nthe futures market, which is the purest form of buying and selling reveals when the market is running out of\nsteam. It reveals whether buying interest is rising or falling on a daily basis. It reveals all the subtleties of pull\nbacks and reversals on tick charts and time charts from minutes to hours. Volume is the fuel that drives the\nmarket. Volume reveals when the major operators are moving in and out of the market. Without volume, nothing\nmoves, and if it does move and the volume is not in agreement, then there is something wrong, and an alarm\nbell rings!\nFor example, if the market is bullish and the futures price is rising on strong and rising volume, then this is\ninstantly telling us that the price action is being validated by the associated volume. The major operators are\nbuying into the move. Equally, if the market is falling and the volume is rising, then once again volume is\nvalidating price. It really is that simple. These principles apply whatever the market, whether it is bonds, interest\nrates, indices, commodities or currencies. What you will discover in this book is that the analysis of price and\nvolume applies to every market, manipulated or otherwise. In the manipulated cash markets of stocks, it\nprovides you with the ultimate weapon to avoid being suckered in by the market makers.\nIn the futures markets, it gives you the ultimate weapon to validate price, and to reveal the true market sentiment\nof buyers and sellers and to take action as the reversals in trend are signalled using volume. Here, we are\nfollowing the major operators who will have the inside view of the market.\nIn the spot forex market we have a different problem. There is no true volume reported. Even if there were,\nwould this be shown as trade size, or 'amounts of currency' being exchanged. Fortunately however, we do have\nan answer to volume in the world's largest financial market, and it’s called tick volume.\nHowever, tick volume is not perfect, nothing is in trading. First, the tick volumes on one platform will vary from\nthe tick volumes on another, since tick data will be provided through the platform of an online broker. Second,\nthe quality of the data will depend on several factors, not least whether the broker is subscribed directly to the\ninterbank liquidity pool directly using one of the expensive wholesale feeds. Nevertheless, a quality FX broker\n",

      "text": "will normally provide a quality feed.\nBut, is tick data valid as a proxy for volume?\nThe short answer is yes, and various studies over the years have shown that tick data as a proxy for 'volume' is\n90% representative in terms of the true 'activity' in the market. After all, volume is really activity, and in this\nsense can be reflected in price, since tick data is simply changes in price. So, if the price is changing fast, then\ndoes this mean that we have significant activity in the market? In my opinion the answer is yes. To prove this\npoint, we only need to watch a tick chart prior to, and just after a significant news release.\nTake the monthly Non Farm Payroll, which every forex trader knows and loves! Assume we are watching a 233\ntick chart. Prior to the release each 233 tick bar may be taking a few minutes to form. During the release and\nimmediately after, each bar is forming in seconds, appearing as if being fired onto the screen using a machine\ngun! A chart that has taken an hour to fill with bars, is now a full frame within minutes.\nThis is activity, pure and simple, which in turn we can assume is representative of volume. There will always be\nmarket manipulation in the spot forex market. In many ways it is the most widely manipulated of all. We only\nhave to consider the currency wars as evidence of this, but as traders, tick volume is what we have, and tick\nvolume is what we use. Whilst it isn't perfect, I can guarantee you one thing. You will be considerably more\nsuccessful using it, than not, and you will see why, once we start to look at the charts themselves across all the\nvarious markets.\nIf you are still not convinced? Let me give you an analogy, not perfect I accept, but which I hope will help.\nImagine that you are at auction, and suppose for argument’s sake that it’s an auction for furniture. It is a cold,\nwet and miserable day in the middle of winter, and the auction room is in a small provincial town. The auction\nroom is almost empty, with few buyers in the room. The auctioneer details the next item, an antique piece of\nfurniture and starts the bidding with his opening price. After a short pause, a bid is made from the room, but\ndespite further efforts to raise the bidding, the auctioneer finally brings the hammer down, selling the item at the\nopening bid.\nNow imagine the same item being sold in a different scenario. This time, the same item is being sold, but the\nauction house is in a large capital city, it is the middle of summer and the auction room is full. The auctioneer\ndetails the next piece which is our antique furniture, and opens the bidding with a price. The price moves\nquickly higher, with bidders signalling interest in the auction room, and phone bidders also joining in.\nEventually the bidding slows and the item is sold.\nIn the first example, the price changed only once, representing a lack of interest, and in our terms a lack of\nbidders in the room, in other words volume. In the second example the price changed several times and quickly\nwith the price action reflecting interest, activity and bidders in the room. In other words volume.\nIn other words, the linkage between activity and price is perfectly valid. Therefore, as far as I’m concerned,\nusing tick data as a proxy for volume data in the forex market is equally valid. Activity and volume go hand in\nhand, and I hope that the above analogy, simple and imperfect as it is, will convince you too.\nThe above simple analogy also highlights three other important points about volume.\nThe first is this. All volume is relative. Suppose for example this had been our first visit to this particular auction\nroom. Is the activity witnessed average, above average or below average. We would not be able to say, since\nwe have no yardstick by which to judge. If we were a regular visitor, then we could judge instantly whether there\nwere more or less attendees than usual, and make a judgement on likely bidding, as a result.\nThis is what makes volume such a powerful indicator. As humans we have the ability to judge relative sizes and\nheights extremely quickly, and it is the relative aspect of volume which gives it such power. Unlike the tape\nreaders we have a chart, which gives us an instant picture of the relative volume bars, whether on an ultra fast\ntick chart, an intra day time chart, or longer term investing chart. It is the relationship in relative terms which is\nimportant.\nThe second point is that volume without price is meaningless. Imagine an auction room with no bidding.\nRemove the price from the chart, and we simply have volume bars. Volume on its own simply reveals interest,\n",

      "text": "but that interest is just that, without the associated price action. It is only when volume and price combine that\nwe have the chemical reaction which creates the explosive power of Volume Price Analysis.\nThird and last, time is a key component. Suppose in our auction room, instead of the bidding lasting a few\nminutes, it had lasted a few hours ( if allowed!). What would this tell us then? That the interest in the item was\nsubdued to say the least. Hardly the frenetic interest of a bidding war.\nTo use a water analogy. Imagine that we have a hosepipe with a sprinkler attached. The water is the price\naction and the sprinkler is our 'volume' control. If the sprinkler is left open, the water will continue to leave the\npipe with no great force, simply falling from the end of the pipe. However, as soon as we start to close our\nsprinkler valve, pressure increases and the water travels further. We have the same amount of water leaving the\npipe, but through a reduced aperture. Time has now become a factor, as the same amount of water is\nattempting to leave the pipe in the same amount of time, but pressure has increased.\nIt is the same with the market.\nHowever, let me be provocative for a moment, and borrow a quote from Richard Wyckoff himself who famously\nsaid :\n“….trading and investing is like any other pursuit—the longer you stay at it the more technique you acquire, and\nanybody who thinks he knows of a short cut that will not involve “sweat of the brow” is sadly mistaken”\nWhilst this sentiment could be applied to almost any endeavour in life, it is particularly relevant in the study of\nprice and volume.\nAs you are probably aware, or will not doubt find out when you begin trading, there are several free 'volume'\nindicators, and many proprietary systems you can buy. Whether free or paid, all have one thing in common.\nThey have neither the capacity nor intellect to analyse the price volume relationship correctly in my view, for the\nsimple reason, that trading is an art, not a science.\nWhen I finished my two weeks with Albert, I then spent the next 6 months just studying charts, and learning to\ninterpret the price and volume relationship. I would sit with my live feed and my two monitors, one for the cash\nmarket and the other for the equivalent futures market, watching every price bar and the associated volume and\nusing my knowledge to interpret future market behaviour. This may not be what you want to read. And some of\nyou may be horrified at how labour intensive this all sounds.\nHowever, just like Wyckoff, I also believe there are no short cuts to success. Technical analysis, in all its\naspects is an art, and interpreting the volume price relationship is no different. It takes time to learn, and time to\nbe quick in your analysis. However, just like the tape readers of the past, once mastered is a powerful skill.\nThe technique is a subjective one, requiring discretionary decision making. It is not, and never will be, one that\nlends itself to automation. If it were, then this book would simply be more fuel for the fire.\nFinally, (and I hope you are still reading and have not been put off by the above statements), one further aspect\nof volume is whose perspective are we using when we talk about buying and selling. Are we talking from a\nwholesalers perspective or from the retail perspective. So, let me explain.\nAs investors or speculators the whole raison d'etre for studying volume is to see what the insiders, the\nspecialists are doing. For the simple reason that whatever they are doing, we want to follow and do as well! The\nassumption being, implied or otherwise, is that they are likely to have a much better idea of where the market is\nheading. This is not an unreasonable assumption to make.\nSo, when the market has moved sharply lower in a price waterfall and a bearish trend, supported by masses of\nvolume, this is a buying climax. It is the wholesalers who are buying and the retail traders who are panic selling.\nA buying climax for us represents an opportunity.\nLikewise, at the top of a bull trend, where we see sustained high volumes, then this is a selling climax. The\nwholesalers are selling to the retail traders and investors who are buying on the expectation of the market going\nto the moon!\nSo remember, when I write about volume throughout the remainder of this book, buying and selling is always\n",

      "text": "Chapter Three\nThe Right Price\nNo price is too low for a bear or too high for a bull.\nUnknown\nNow we turn to the counter balance of volume which is price, and forgive me for a moment if we return to Jesse\nLivermore and one of his many quotes which I mentioned at the start of this book:\n“there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever\nhappens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again”\nNow to use and paraphrase this famous quote, I would say that there is nothing new in trading. As I said in\nchapter one, Volume Price Analysis has been around for over 100 years. The same is true when we consider\nthe analysis of price, and the only representation of price which truly changed how traders studied and\nanalysed charts was in the introduction of candlestick charts in the early 1990's.\nFads come and go in trading. Something that was in 'vogue' a few years ago, is no longer considered valid, and\nsome 'new' approach is then promoted. One approach which is being marketed heavily at the moment is 'price\naction trading' or PAT. This is as it sounds. Trading using an analysis of price, with no (or very few) indicators,\nwhich I find strange. And my reasons are as follows.\nImagine suggesting to Jesse Livermore, Charles Dow, Richard Wyckoff, and Richard Ney, that we had devised\na new and exciting way to analyse the markets. The ticker tape print out would now ONLY show the price, but\nNO volume. I'm sure Jesse and the others would have been struck dumb at such a suggestion. But don't worry.\nIn this book I explain price action trading, which is then validated with volume. So you get two approaches for\nthe price of one here! Now that's what I call value for money!!\nHowever, I digress. Living close to London as I do, and just a stone's throw away from The President, is the old\nLIFFE building, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. As a frequent visitor to this\npart of London, I would often drive past this exchange, and at any time during the day, would see the traders in\ntheir different brightly coloured jackets, dashing out to grab coffees and sandwiches before rushing back to the\nfloor of the exchange. Without exception these were generally young men, loud and brash, and in fact on the\ncorner of Walbrook and Cannon Street there now stands a bronze statue of a floor trader, mobile phone in hand.\nThese were the days of fast cars, and aggressive trading, and it was ironic that this was the world where I\nstarted my own trading career, with FTSE 100 futures orders filled on the floor of the exchange.\nThis was the world of adrenaline pumped traders, yelling and screaming using unintelligible hand signals,\nbuying and selling in a frenetic atmosphere of noise and sweat. It was positively primordial where the overriding\nemotion emanating from the floor was fear, and obvious to anyone who cared to view it from the public gallery.\nHowever, the advent of electronic trading changed all of this, and the LIFFE exchange was one of many\ncasualties. All the traders left trading and moved away from the pit, and onto electronic platforms. The irony is,\nthat most of the traders, and I have spoken to many over the years, failed to make the transition from pit trading,\nto electronic trading, for one very simple reason.\nA pit trader, could sense not only the fear and greed, but also judge the flow of the market from the buying and\nselling in the pit. In other words, to a pit trader, this was volume or order flow. This is what a pit trader saw and\nsensed every day of the week, the flow of money, the weight of market sentiment, and the trading opportunities\nthat followed as a result. In other words, they could 'see' the volume, they could see when the big buyers were\ncoming into the market and ride on their coat tails. This is the equivalent of volume on the screen.\nHowever, without being able to see, judge, and feel the flow in the pit, most of these traders failed to make a\nsuccessful transition to screen trading. Some succeeded, but most were never able to make that move, from an\nenvironment where price action was supported by something tangible. Whether they would call it activity, order\nflow, sentiment, or just the 'smell of the market' this is what brought the price action to life for them, and why they\nstruggled to succeed with the advent of the electronic era.\n",

      "text": "Pit trading still continues today, and if you do get the chance to view it in action, I would urge you to go. Once\nyou have seen it for real, you will understand why volume is so powerful in supporting price, and why I believe\nthe exponents of PAT are simply promulgating something different for the sake of it.\nWhilst it is undoubtedly true to say that price action encapsulates all the news, views and decisions from traders\nand investors around the world, and that with detailed analysis we can arrive at a conclusion of future market\ndirection, without volume we have no way of validating that price analysis. Volume gives us our bearings, it\nallows us to triangulate the price action and to check the validity of our analysis. This is what the pit traders of\nold were doing – they would see a price move, validate it by considering the order flow in the pit, and act\naccordingly. For us, it is the same. We simply use an electronic version of order flow which is the volume on our\nscreens.\nBut, let me give you another example.\nReturning to our auction again, only this time there is no physical sale room. Instead we are joining an online\nauction, and perhaps now you can begin to imagine the problems that the ex pit traders encountered. We have\nmoved from the physical sale room, where we can see all the buyers, the number of people in the room, the\nphone bids and the speed of the bidding. In a physical sale room we also get a sense of where the price starts\nto pause. We see bidders become fearful as the price approaches their limit and they hesitate with the next bid,\njust fractionally, but enough to tell you they are near their limit. This is what the pit traders missed.\nIn an online auction we are logged in and waiting for the auction to start. An item we want to buy appears and\nwe start bidding. We have no idea how many other bidders are there, we have no idea if we are playing on a\nlevel playing field. All we see is the price being quoted. The auctioneer, for all we know, could be taking bids\n'off the wall' (fake bids in other words) which happens more often than many people think. The reason is that all\ngood auctioneers like to encourage auction fever – it’s good for business, so they use every trick in the book.\nMeanwhile back to our online auction. We continue bidding and eventually win the item.\nBut, have we got our item at a good price? And, in this scenario we are only referring to price and not value,\nwhich is a very different concept. Besides, I hope by now, you are beginning to get the picture. In the online\nauction all we see is price.\nTherefore, in a real online ‘auction’ of trading, do we really want to base our trading decisions solely on price?\nFurthermore, the great iconic traders of the past would have given us their answer, and it would have been a\nvery emphatic NO.\nOnce again I accept it is an imperfect example, but one which I hope makes the point.\nTo me, a price chart with no volume is only part of the story. Price does encapsulate market sentiment at a given\nand precise moment in time, but with so much market manipulation prevalent in so many markets, why ignore\nsuch a valuable tool which is generally provided free.\nWhilst price is a leading indicator, in itself, it only reveals what has gone before, from which we then interpret\nwhat is likely to happen next. Whilst we may be correct in our analysis, it is volume which can complete the\npicture.\nIn a manipulated market, volume reveals the truth behind the price action. In a pure market, volume reveals the\ntruth behind market sentiment and order flow.\nSo, let's take a closer look at price, and in particular the effect that changes in technology have had on the four\nprinciple elements of a price bar, the open, the high, the low and the close. And the most significant change in\nthe last few years has been the move to electronic trading, which has had the most profound effect on two\nelements of the four, namely the opening and closing prices.\nScroll back to the days of Ney and earlier, and the markets in those days only traded during a physical session.\nThe market would open when the exchange opened, and close when the exchange closed at a prescribed time.\nTrading was executed on the floor of the exchange, and everyone knew when the market was about to open or\nclose. This gave the opening and closing prices great significance, particularly on the open and close of the\nday. The opening price would be eagerly awaited by traders and investors and, as the closing bell approached,\n",

      "text": "frenetic trading activity would be taking place as traders closed out their end of day positions. This is now\ngenerally referred to as regular trading hours (RTH), and is the time the exchange is physically open. Whilst this\nprinciple still applies to stock markets around the world, with the NYSE trading from 9.30am to 4.00pm, and the\nLSE open from 8.00 am until 4.30 pm, what has revolutionised the trading world is the advent of electronic\ntrading.\nThe platform that really changed the game was Globex, introduced by the CME in 1992, since when virtually\nevery futures contract can now be traded 24 hours a day. Whilst the cash markets, such as stocks, are restricted\nto the physical time set by the exchange, what has changed, certainly with regard to this market, has been the\nintroduction of electronic index futures, which now trade around the clock. What this means, in effect, is that the\nopening and closing prices of the cash market are now far less important than they once were.\nThe reason is simply the introduction of Globex, as electronic trading has become the standard for index\nfutures, which are derivatives of the cash market indices. The ES E-mini (S&P 500) was the first to be\nintroduced in 1997, followed shortly afterwards by the NQ E-mini (Nasdaq 100) in 1999, and the YM E-mini\n(Dow Jones 30) in 2002. With these index futures now trading overnight through the Far East and Asian\nsession, the open of the cash index is no longer a surprise with the futures signalling overnight market\nsentiment well in advance. By contrast, in the days before the advent of electronic trading, a gapped open, up or\ndown, would have given traders a very strong signal of market intent. Whereas today, the open for the major\nindices is no longer a great surprise as it is forecast by the overnight futures markets.\nWhilst it is certainly true to say that individual stocks may well react for a variety of reasons to sentiment in the\nbroad index, generally all boats tend to rise on a rising tide, and therefore likely to follow suit. The open and the\nclose for individual stocks is still significant, but the point is that the index which reflects market sentiment will\nbe broadly known in advance, making the open less relevant than it once was.\nThe same could be said of the closing price. When the physical exchange closes, stocks are closed for the day\nin the cash markets, but electronic trading continues on the index future and moves on into the Far East session\nand beyond.\nThis facet of electronic trading also applies to all commodities, which are now traded virtually 24 hours a day on\nthe Globex platform, and both currency futures, and currency spot markets also trade 24 hours a day.\nThe electronic nature of trading is reflected in the price chart. Twenty years ago, gap up or gap down price\naction would have been the norm, with the open of a subsequent bar closing well above or below the close of\nthe previous bar. These were often excellent signals of a break out in the instrument, particularly where this was\nconfirmed with volume. Such price action is now rare, and generally restricted to the equity markets, which then\ncatch up when the physical exchange opens the next day. Virtually every other market is now electronic such\nas the spot forex market, and as we have just seen, indices catch up with the overnight futures as do\ncommodities and other futures contracts.\nThe open of one bar will generally be at exactly the same price as the close of the previous bar, which reveals\nlittle. This is one of the many effects that electronic trading is now having on price action on the charts, and is\nlikely to continue to have in the future. Electronic trading is here to stay, and the significance of these elements\nof price action in various markets will change as a result.\nIf the market is running 24 hours a day, then the open of one bar will simply follow the close of the previous bar,\nuntil the market closes for the weekend. From a price action trading perspective, this gives us little in the way of\nany valid 'sentiment' signals, which makes volume even more relevant in today's electronic world – in my\nhumble opinion at any rate!\nHowever, let's take a look at an individual bar in more detail, and the four elements which create it, namely the\nopen, the high, the low and the close, and the importance of these from a Volume Price Analysis perspective. At\nthis point I would like to say that the only price bars I use in the remainder of this book, and in my own trading\nare candlesticks. This is what Albert taught all those years ago, and it is how I learnt.\nI have tried bar charts and thought I could dispense with candles. However, I have returned to candles and do\nnot plan to use any other system, for the foreseeable future. I do understand that some traders prefer to use\nbars, line charts, Heikin Ashi, and many other. However, my apprenticeship in Volume Price Analysis was with\n",

I hope, by the end of this book\nyou too will agree.\nTherefore, I want to start by dissecting a typical candle and explain how much we can learn from it. In any\ncandle, there are seven key elements. The open, high, low and close, the upper and lower wicks and the\nspread as shown in Fig 3.10. Whilst each of these plays a part in defining the price action within the time frame\nunder consideration, it is the wicks and the spread which are the most revealing in terms of market sentiment,\nwhen validated with volume.\nFig 3.10 A Typical Candle\nPerhaps the simplest way to visualise the price action contained within a candle, and is applicable regardless\nof timeframe (from a tick chart to a monthly chart), is to display the price action, as a sine wave, with the market\noscillating back and forth, as buyers and sellers battle for supremacy.\nThe image in Fig 3.11 is a visual representation of this price action and in this case it is the buyers who are\ntriumphant. However, the price action could have taken a different journey in creating this candle. It is the\ncompleted candle which is important.\n",

      "text": "Fig 3.11 Price Action As A Sine Wave\nLet's start with the spread which reveals the sentiment for that session.\nA wide spread between the open and the close indicates strong market sentiment, either bullish or bearish,\ndepending on whether the closing price finished above the opening price or below it.\nA narrow spread between the open and the close indicates sentiment which is weak. There is no strong view\none way or the other. The wicks to the top and bottom are indicative of change. A change in sentiment during\nthe session. After all, if the sentiment had remained firm throughout, then we would have no wicks at all. This is\nthe equivalent of our online auction, or physical auction, where the price opens at one level, and closes at a\nhigher level once sold. The price action would simply create a solid candle with no wick to the top or the bottom,\nand in the context of trading, suggesting strong and continued sentiment in the direction of the candle.\nThis is the power of the wicks and why, when used in combination with the spread, reveal so much about true\nmarket sentiment. It forms the basis of price action trading, which is perfectly valid in it's own right.\nHowever, why stop at this point and refuse to validate that price action with volume? This is something I simply\ncannot understand and perhaps any PAT traders reading this book can convince me otherwise. Just drop me\nan email as I am always happy to learn.\nSo, as you can see, the length and context of the wick, whether to the upside or the downside is paramount in\nVolume Price Analysis, and the easiest way to explain this is to consider some further visualisation examples,\nwhich will help to make the point.\nLet’s take two examples and the first is in Fig 13.12. Here we have a wick where the price has opened, the\nmarket has moved lower, and then recovered to close back at the open price. In the second example in Fig\n13.13 we have a wick where the price has opened, the market has moved higher and then moved lower to\nclose back at the open.\n",

      "text": "Let's analyse what's happening here with the price action and market sentiment. In both cases we can be\ncertain that this is the profile of the price action, since the closing price has returned to the original opening\nprice. So there is no guesswork. It is true that within the price action, there may have been ups and downs, pull\nbacks and reversals, but at some point in the session, the price action hit a low, or a high and then returned to\nthe original starting point.\nLower Wick Example\nFig 3.12 Lower Wick Example\nTaking the lower wick example first, the price bar opened and almost immediately sellers were in the market\nforcing the price lower, and overwhelming the buyers. Perhaps within the move lower, there were pauses and\nbrief attempts to rally, which would have been seen perhaps in faster time frames, and a key part of trading.\nHowever, in this session, as far as we are concerned, the sellers remained in control throughout the first part of\nthe candle’s creation.\nAt some point during the course of the session, the buyers started to come back into the market, wrestling\ncontrol from the sellers as the market price had now become an attractive buying proposition. Gradually near\nthe bottom of the price bar, the sellers finally give up, having been overwhelmed by the buyers who gradually\ntake control. Now it's the turn of the sellers to be under pressure, as more and more buyers flood into the market,\noverwhelming the sellers and taking the price back higher once again, to finally close at the opening price.\nBut, what does this price action reveal? And the answer is two very important things.\nFirst, that in this session, whatever the time frame may have been, there has been a complete reversal in market\nsentiment. Why? Because the selling pressure that was in evidence during the first part of the candle’s creation,\nhas been completely overwhelmed and absorbed in the second half.\nSecond, that the sentiment on the close of the bar is bullish – it has to be, since we know that the price action\nclosed at the open, so at the instant of closure, the price must have been rising, supported by all the buying\npressure underneath.\n",

      "text": "Does this mean that this is signalling a reversal in any trend? The short answer is no, and you will discover why\nonce we start looking at volume, which will then give us the complete picture. At the moment we are simply\nconsidering price action which is only half the picture, but the point I want to make, is that the wick on a candle\nis EXTREMELY important, and a vital part of Volume Price Analysis, as is the spread. In this case the spread\nwas zero, which is JUST as significant as any large spread of the candle.\nI hope that the above example has helped to explain what is happening 'inside' the candle with the associated\nprice action. This is a very simple example, with the price action split symmetrically into a 50/50 window.\nNevertheless, the principle holds good. The price action may have been split into a 25/75 or even a 15/85, but\nthe point is this – the sellers were overwhelmed by the buyers during the course of the session that the candle\nis representing.\nThis now brings me on to another area of volume analysis which we are also going to consider later in the\nbook. I've already mentioned Volume Price Analysis or VPA several times so far, which is the relationship\nbetween volume and price over the entire life of the candle, but what happens within the life of the candle for\nexample. Where is the buying and selling actually taking place, and this is called Volume At Price, or VAP for\nshort.\nWhilst VPA focuses on the 'linear relationship' between volume and price once the candle has closed, VAP\nfocuses on the volume profile during the creation of the price bar. In other words, 'where' has the volume been\nconcentrated within the associated price action.\nWe could say that VPA is our big picture of the volume price relationship on the outside of the candle, whilst\nVAP gives us the detail of the volume profile, 'inside' the candle. This helps to give us an additional perspective\non our 'outside' view – two views of the same thing, but from different perspectives, with one validating the\nother. A further triangulation of the volume and price relationship.\nNow let's look at our other example, which was the upper wick example.\nUpper Wick Example\n",

However, as the session\ndevelops the price action reaches a point at which the buyers are beginning to struggle, the market is becoming\nresistant to higher prices and gradually the sellers begin to regain control.\nFinally, at the high of the session, the buyers run out of steam and as the sellers come into the market, the\nbuyers close out their profits. This selling pressure then forces prices lower, as waves of sellers hit the price\naction.\nThe candle closes back at the open price and the session closes. Once again, there are two key points with this\nprice behaviour which are fundamental.\nFirst, we have a complete reversal in market sentiment, this time from bullish to bearish. Second, the sentiment\nat the close is bearish, as the open and closing price are the same.\nAgain, this is a stylised view of the price behaviour. Nevertheless, this is what has happened over the session\nof the candle, and it makes no difference as to what time frame we are considering.\nThis could be a candle on a tick chart, a 5 minute chart, a daily chart or a weekly chart, and this is where the\nconcept of time comes into play. This type of price action, accompanied with the correct volume profiles, is\ngoing to have a significantly greater effect when seen on a daily or weekly chart, then when seen on a 1 minute\nor 5 minute chart.\nThis is something we will cover in more detail in the next few chapters.\nBut, what does this price action look like on a price chart in candle form?\nLower Wick Example\n",

      "text": "Chapter Four\nVolume Price Analysis – First Principles\n[On the continual learning in share investing] Wherever learning curves begin in this mercurial business, they\nnever seem to end.\nJohn Neff (1931-)\nIn this chapter I want to start with some basic tenets for Volume Price Analysis VPA, but first of all, let me set out\nwhat I believe are the guiding principles in order to be consistently successful as a trader using this approach. I\nmust stress, these are the principles I use every day, and have been developed over 16 years, since I first\nstarted using this technique based on Albert's teaching. Despite the cost and surreal experience, I am eternally\ngrateful to Albert for setting me (and my husband David) on the right trading road. And I hope this book will do\nthe same for you.\nNow, these are not rules, but simply guiding principles to help to put the rest of what you are about to learn into\ncontext. And just as an aside, for the remainder of the book I will be referring to Volume Price Analysis as VPA\n– it's quicker and easier for you, and for me!\nPrinciple No 1: Art Not Science\nThe first principle to understand is that learning to read charts using VPA is an art, it is not a NOT a science.\nMoreover, it is not a technique that lends itself easily to automation or software. Although it does take a little\nwhile to become proficient, you will be rewarded for your effort and time. It can then be applied to any instrument\nin any market in any time frame. The reason software does not work with VPA, is simply that most of the\nanalysis is subjective. You are comparing and analysing price behaviour against the associated volume,\nlooking for confirmations or anomalies, whilst at the same time, comparing volume to judge its strength or\nweakness in the context of volume history.\nA software program, does not have any subjectivity in its decision making. Hence it can never work.\nThe other advantage is that once you have learnt this technique, it is effectively free to use for life! The only cost\nis any data feed you may need for the live volume, and your investment in this book!\nPrinciple No 2 : Patience\nThis principle took me some time to learn, so I hope that I can save you a huge amount of wasted effort here.\nThe financial market is like a super tanker. It does not just stop and turn on a dime or sixpence. The market\nalways has momentum and will almost always continue beyond the candle or candle pattern which is signalling\na potential reversal or an anomaly. When I first started, I always became very excited whenever I saw a trading\nsignal, and would enter a position immediately, only to see the market continue on for a while before the signal\nwas validated with the market duly changing course.\nThe reason for this is very simple to understand once you begin to think about what is happening in each price\nbar, and in terms of the reality of the market. So, let me use an analogy here to help illustrate this point.\nThe analogy is of a summer shower of rain. The sun is shining, then there is a change, the clouds blow in, and\nin a few minutes the rain begins to fall, lightly at first, then heavier, before slowing again, and finally stopping.\nAfter a few minutes the sun comes out again, and starts drying up the rain.\nThis analogy gives us a visual picture of what actually happens when a price reversal occurs. Let's take an\nexample of a down trend where the market has been selling off over a period of several down candles. At this\npoint we begin to see signs of potential buying coming into the market. The sellers are being overwhelmed by\nthe buyers. However, they are NOT all overwhelmed immediately within the price action of the candle. Some\nsellers continue to hang on, believing that the market is going to move lower. The market does move a little\nlower, but then starts to tick higher and some more sellers are frightened out of the market. The market then\ndrops back lower once again, before recovering, and in doing so shakes out the more obstinate sellers. Finally,\nthe market is ready to move higher having 'mopped up' the last dregs of selling.\n",

      "text": "As I said before, the market never stops dead and reverses. It always takes time for all the sellers or all the\nbuyers to be 'mopped up', and it is this constant whipsawing which creates the sideways congestion price\nzones that we often see after an extended trend move, higher or lower. This is where price support and\nresistance become so powerful, and which are also a key element of VPA.\nThe moral here is not to act immediately as soon as a signal appears. Any signal is merely a warning sign of an\nimpending change and we do have to be patient. When a shower of rain stops, it doesn't stop suddenly, it\ngradually peters out, then stops. When you spill something, and have to mop it up with some absorbent paper,\nthe 'first pass' collects most of the spill, but it takes a 'second pass' to complete the job. This is the market. It is a\nsponge. It takes time to complete the mopping up operation, before it is ready to turn.\nI hope I have made the point! Please be patient and wait. The reversal will come, but not instantly from one\nsignal on one candle.\nPrinciple No 3 : It’s All Relative\nThe analysis of volume is all relative and I only came to this conclusion once I stopped obsessing about my\nvolume feed. When I first started I became obsessed with trying to understand every aspect of my volume feed.\nWhere did it come from? How was the data collected? Was it accurate? How did it compare to other feeds? And\nwas there something better that would give me more accurate signals, and so on. This debate continues to this\nday in the many trading forums with discussions centred around the provenance of the data.\nAfter spending many months trying to compare feeds and back test, I soon realised that there was NOTHING to\nbe gained from worrying about minor imperfections or discrepancies. As I wrote earlier, trading and VPA is an\nart, not a science. Data feeds will vary from broker to broker and platform to platform thereby creating slightly\ndifferent candle patterns. If you compare a chart from one broker with another of the same instrument and time\nframe, then the chances are you will have two different candlesticks. And the reason for this is very\nstraightforward. It is because the close of the candle will depend on a variety of things, not least the clock speed\non your computer, where you are in the world, and at what time during the session the closing price is triggered.\nThey all vary.\nData feeds are complex in how they calculate and present the data to you on the screen. They all come from\ndifferent sources, and are managed in different ways. Even those from the cash markets will vary, spot forex\nfeeds even more so. But, it’s really not a big issue for one simple reason.\nVolume is all relative, so it makes no difference as long as you are using the same feed all the time. This is\nwhat months of work proved to me.\nThis is why I lose patience with traders who say that tick data as a proxy for volume is only 90% accurate. So\nwhat? For all I care, it can be 70% accurate or 80% accurate. I am not interested in the 'accuracy'. All I am\ninterested in is consistency. As long as the feed is consistent, then that's fine, because I am comparing my\nvolume bar on my feed with previous volume bars, on my feed ! I am not comparing it with someone else's\nfeed. I admit it did take time before it dawned on me that this common sense approach was perfectly valid.\nTherefore, please don't waste as much time as I did. Volume is all relative because we are constantly\ncomparing one volume bar with another, and judging whether this is high, low or average with what has gone\nbefore. If the data is imperfect, then it makes no difference whatsoever, as I am comparing imperfect data with\nimperfect data.\nThe same argument applies to tick data in the spot forex market. I do accept it is imperfect again, but we are\nonly comparing one bar with another, and provided it is displaying activity, that's fine. It's an imperfect world and\none we have to live and trade in. The free tick volume feed on a simple MT4 platform works perfectly – trust me.\nI've used it for years and make money every day using it. Furthermore it is provided, for free, by the broker.\nPrinciple No 4 : Practise Makes Perfect\nIt takes time to become proficient in any skill, but once learnt is never forgotten. The trading techniques you will\nlearn in this book work in all time frames, and are equally valid, whether you are a speculator or investor. As an\ninvestor you may be looking for a buy and hold over months, so will be considering the longer term charts of\ndays and weeks, much like Richard Ney for example. Alternatively, you may be an intra day scalping trader\nusing VPA on tick charts or fast time charts. So, take your time and don't be impatient. It is worth the time and\n",

We always use a variety of other techniques to confirm the picture and provide\nadditional validation. The most important of these are support and resistance, for the reasons that I outlined in\nPrinciple No 2. This is where the market is pausing and executing its 'mopping up' operations, before reversing.\nAlternatively, it may simply be a pause point in a longer term trend, which will then be validated by our volume\nanalysis. A breakout from one of these regions of consolidation, coupled with volume, is always a strong signal.\nTrends are equally important, as are price pattern analysis, all part of the art form which is technical analysis.\nPrinciple No 6 : Validation or Anomaly\nIn using VPA as our analytical approach, we are only ever looking for two things.\nWhether the price has been validated by the volume, or whether there is an anomaly with the price. If the price\nis validated then that confirms a continuation of the price behaviour. By contrast if there is an anomaly, then this\nis sending a signal of a potential change. These are the only things we are constantly searching for in VPA.\nValidation or anomaly. Nothing else. And here are some examples of validation based on single bars, before\nmoving onto multiple bars and actual chart examples.\nExamples Of Validation\nFig 4.10 Wide Spread Candle, High Volume\nIn the example in Fig 4.10 of a wide spread up candle with small wicks to top and bottom, the associated\nvolume is well above average, so the volume is validating the price action.\nIn this case we have a market which is bullish, and has risen strongly in the trading session closing just below\nthe high of the session. If this is a valid move then we would expect to see the effort required to push the market\n",

It takes effort for the market to rise and also takes\neffort for the market to fall, so if there has been a large change in price in the session, then we expect to see this\nvalidated by a well above average volume bar. Which we have. Therefore, in this case the volume validates the\nprice. And from this we can assume two things. First, that the price move is genuine, and has not been\nmanipulated by the market makers, and second, that for the time being, the market is bullish, and until we see\nan anomaly signalled, then we can continue to maintain any long position that we may have in the market.\nFig 4.11 Narrow Spread Candle, Low Volume\nFig 4.11 is an example of a narrow spread candle accompanied by low volume. In this case the price has risen,\nbut only marginally higher, and the spread of the candle is therefore very narrow. The wicks to the top and\nbottom are once again small. The associated volume is well below average, and again the question that we\nhave to ask ourselves is simple. Is the volume validating the price action, and the answer once again is yes.\nAnd the reason is again because of effort and result. In this case the market has only risen in price by a small\namount, and therefore we would expect to see this reflected in the volume, which should also be low. After all, if\neffort and result validate one another, the effort required to move the market a few points higher (the result),\nshould only warrant a small amount of effort (the volume). So once again, we have a true picture with the\nvolume validating the price. Now let's look at these two examples again, but this time as anomalies.\nExamples Of Anomalies\n",

      "text": "Fig 4.12 Wide Spread Candle, Low Volume\nIn Fig 4.12 we have our first anomaly which can be explained as follows. It is clear we have a wide spread up\ncandle, and if we follow Wyckoff's third rule then this result, should be matched by an equal amount of effort.\nWhat we have instead is a big result, from little effort. This is an anomaly. After all for a wide spread up candle,\nwe would expect to see a high volume bar, but here we have a low volume bar. Immediately the alarm bells\nstart ringing, since something is not right here.\nOne question to ask is why do we have low volume when we should expect to see high volume. Is this a trap up\nmove by the markets, or the market makers? Quite possibly, and this is where you can begin to see the power of\nsuch simple analysis. In one price bar, we can immediately see that something is wrong. There is an anomaly,\nbecause if this were a genuine move higher, then the buyers would be supporting the move higher with a high\nvolume bar. Instead there is a low volume bar.\nIf we were in a long position in the market and this appeared, we would immediately start to question what is\nhappening. For example, why has this anomaly appeared? Is it an early warning of a possible trap? This is a\npattern which often occurs at the start of trading in equity markets. What is happening here is that the market\nmakers are trying to 'feel out' the sentiment in the market. The above could be from a one minute chart for\nexample. The market opens, then the price is pushed higher to test interest in the market from the buyers. If\nthere is little or no buying interest, as here, then the price will be marked back down, with further price testing.\nRemember from earlier in the book, that the futures index markets will have already been trading overnight on\nGlobex, giving the market makers a clear idea of bullish or bearish sentiment. All that is needed is to test out the\nprice level at which to pitch the price for the opening few minutes. Not only is this done for the main index, but\nalso for each individual stock. It is extraordinary how easy this is to see, and is instantly visible with volume.\nThis is why I cannot understand the attraction of price action trading. Without volume a PAT trader would have\nno idea. All they would see is a wide spread up candle and assume the market was bullish.\nThis is very easy to prove and all we need to do is to watch a couple of charts from the opening bell. Choose\n",

      "text": "the main index, and a couple of stocks. The anomaly will appear time and time again. The market makers are\ntesting the levels of buying and selling interest, before setting the tone for the session, with an eye on any news\nreleases due in the morning, which can always be used to further manipulate the markets, and never allowing\n‘a serious crisis go to waste’ (Rahm Emanuel). After all, if they were buying into the market, then this would be\nreflected in a high volume bar.\nThe volume bar is signalling that the market is NOT joining in this price action, and there is a reason. In this\ncase it's the market makers in equities testing the levels of buying and selling, and therefore not committing into\nthe move, until they are sure buyers will come into the market at this price level.\nThe same scenario could equally apply in the forex market.\nA fundamental item of news is released, and the market makers see an opportunity to take stops out of the\nmarket. The price jumps on the news, but the associated volume is low. Now let’s look at another example of an\nanomaly.\nFig 4.13 Narrow Spread Candle, Low Volume\nOnce again this is a clear signal of a potential trap. The move higher is NOT a genuine move but a fake move,\ndesigned to suck traders into weak positions, and also take out stops, before reversing sharply and moving in\nthe opposite direction.

      "text": "volume (effort), but this is not the case here.\nThe small price increase has been generated by a huge amount of volume, so clearly something is wrong.\nGenerally, we would expect to see this height of volume bar, accompany a wide spread candle with the volume\ndriving the price higher. But, in this case the high volume has only resulted in a very small rise in the price.\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw. The market is starting to look weak, and is typical of a candle\npattern that starts to develop at the top of a bullish trend, or the bottom of a bearish trend.\nFor example in an established bullish trend the market opens, and starts to rise a little, but the buyers (longs)\nare now starting to take their profits, as they have been in this trend for while and feel that this is the right time to\nclose out. However, as these positions are closed out, more eager buyers come in, (as most traders and\ninvestors always buy at the top of markets), but the price never rises as the longs continue to liquidate and take\ntheir profits, before more buyers come in, and the cycle repeats throughout the session.\nWhat is actually happening is that the market has reached a price at which further effort does not result in higher\nprices, as each wave of new buyers is met with longs selling out at this level and taking their profits, 'off the\ntable'. So there is no sustained move higher in price.\nIn other words, what this combination of price and volume is revealing is weakness in the market. If we were to\nimagine a profile of the volume bar in terms of selling and buying volumes, the buyers would just outweigh the\nsellers, reflecting the narrow price spread.\nThis is akin to driving up an icy hill which is gradually increasing in steepness. At the start we can still move\nhigher, but gradually as we try to move up the hill we have to increase the power, eventually getting to a stage\nwhere we are on full power and standing still, as the wheels spin on the ice. Perhaps not a perfect analogy, but\none which I hope makes the point and cements this idea in place. In our car analogy, we are now stationary,\nhalfway up the hill, engine on full power, wheels spinning and going nowhere! What happens next is we start\nsliding backwards, gaining momentum as we go and mirrors what happened in the price action described. The\nmarket reached a point where no matter how much more effort is applied, is now resistant to higher prices, and\nthe sellers are knocking back the buying.\nThe reverse, also happens after a trend run lower. In this case, it is the selling which is absorbed by the buying,\nand once again signals a potential reversal point as the market runs out of steam. After all, if the selling had\nfollowed through, then we would have seen a wide spread down candle, and not a narrow spread candle.\nNow this candle and volume relationship also raises another much deeper question, and here we go back to\nthe insiders, and the market makers.\nIf we return to our bullish example again, with the narrow spread candle and the high volume, the question we\nmight reasonably ask, is 'who is actually selling here?' Is it the investors and speculators, exiting the market\nafter the trend run higher, or is it another group perhaps? Maybe it is the insiders and the market makers ? Who\nis it more likely to be? After all, we know that most investors and traders tend to buy at the top when in fact they\nshould be selling, and sell at the bottom when they should be buying. Something which the specialists and\nmarket makers are well aware of in the psychology and make up of most traders and investors.\nThey also know this group is easy to frighten out of the market. Generally, they get in far too late after a bullish\ntrend has been in place for some time, and only jump in when they feel it is safe, having watched the market\nmove higher and higher, regretting the decision not to enter much earlier. As the late Christopher Browne once\nsaid ‘The time to buy stocks is when they are on sale, and not when they are high priced because everyone\nwants to own them. This sentiment applies to any instrument or market. Buying when ‘on sale’ is always at the\nbottom of a trend, and not at a top!\n'Missing an opportunity' is a classic trader (and investor) fear. The trader waits and waits before finally jumping\nin, just at the point when the market is turning and they should be thinking of getting out. This is what the\ninsiders, specialists, market makers and big operators bank on, trader fear. Remember, they see both sides of\nthe market from their unique and privileged positions.\nBack to the question! The specialists have driven prices higher, but the market is now struggling at this level.\nThey are selling to the market to clear their warehouse, but the buyers are not there in sufficient numbers to\n",

      "text": "move the price higher, as it is constantly knocked back by longer term traders, selling out and taking their profits\noff the table. The specialists continue selling into the buying, but the volume of buyers is too small, in contrast to\nthe number of sellers, to move the price significantly higher, as each attempt to push the market higher is hit\nwith more selling, which in turn is replenished with more buyers.\nWhat is actually taking place here is a battle. The first sign of a real struggle, with the specialists struggling to\nclear their warehouse before moving the market lower, and fast. The market is not receptive to higher prices, but\nthe specialists cannot move the market lower until they are ready, and so the battle continues. I explain this in\nmuch greater detail later in the book. They maintain the price at the current level attracting more buyers in, who\nare hoping to jump into the trend and take some easy profits, but the sellers keep selling, preventing any real\nrise in price.\nThis is one of the many classic relationships to look for on your charts. As I have said many times before, this\ncould be on a fast tick chart, or a slow time chart. The signal is the same. It is an early warning that the market is\nweak and struggling at this level, and therefore you should either be taking any profit off the table, if you have an\nexisting position, or, preparing to take a position on any reversal in trend.\nMoreover, it is important to remember that just as a candle can have a different significance, depending on\nwhere it appears in the trend, the same is true with VPA.\nWhen an anomaly occurs, and we will start looking at actual chart examples, the first point of reference is\nalways where we are in the trend, which will also depend on the time frame. However, this is one of the many\nbeauties of this type of trading analysis. For example, on a 5 minute chart, a trend might be considered as one\nlasting an hour, or perhaps even two hours. Whereas on a daily chart, a trend could last for weeks or even\nmonths. Therefore, when we talk about a trend, it is important to understand the context of a trend. A trend is\nalways relative to the time frame we are are trading. Some traders only consider a trend to be valid if it is over\ndays, weeks and months, the super cycles if you like.\nHowever, I don’t subscribe to this view. To me a trend on a 1 minute or a 5 minute chart is just as valid. It is a\nprice trend, which may be a short term pull back in a longer term trend, or it may be confirming the longer term\ntrend. It makes no difference. All that matters is that the trend, is a trend in price. The price has moved the same\nway for some period of time, in that time frame.\nJust remember. VPA applied to a 5 minute chart will yield just as many profitable and low risk trades as on a\nlonger term daily or weekly chart. The analysis is the same.\nThe point I am making here is this – whenever we see an anomaly which sets the alarm bell ringing, the first\nstep is to establish were we are in any trend. In other words, we get our bearings first. For example, are we at a\npossible bottom, where perhaps the market has been selling off for some time, but is now looking at a major\nreversal?\nOr perhaps we are half way up or down a trend, and we are merely observing a minor pull back or reversal in\nthe longer term trend. Deciding where we are in the trend, is where we bring in some of our other analytical\ntools which then help to complement VPA and gives us the 'triangulation' we need.\nIn judging where we are in the trend, and potential reversal points, we will always be looking at support and\nresistance, candle patterns, individual candles, and trend lines. All of this will help to give us our 'bearings' and\nhelp to identify where we are in the price action on the chart. A perspective if you like, and a framework against\nwhich to judge the significance of our analysis of volume and price.\nMultiple Candle Examples\nI now want to explain how we use VPA with multiple candles and volume, as opposed to single candles. The\napproach is identical as we are only ever looking for two things. Is the volume confirming the price action, or is\nthis an anomaly?\n",

      "text": "Fig 4.14 Multiple Bar Validation In Up Trend\nIn the first example in Fig 4.14 we have a bullish trend developing in a rising market, and what is obvious is that\nrising prices are accompanied by rising volume.\nThis is exactly what we would expect to see and furthermore having multiple volume bars also gives us a\nbenchmark history, against which to judge future volume bars.\nIf we were watching this price action live, this is what we would see happening on our chart. The first candle\nforms, a narrow spread up candle with low volume, which is fine. The volume validates the price, no anomaly\nhere. The second candle then begins to form, and on close inspection we note that the spread of this is wider\nthan the first, and based on Wyckoff's rule, we expect to see greater volume that on the first bar, which is indeed\nthe case. So the up trend is valid, the volume has validated the price on both candles.\nBy the time the third candle starts to form, and closes with a spread which is wider than both the first and the\nsecond, we should expect a volume bar which reflects Wyckoff's third law of effort vs result. The third law which\nstates we have increased the result (price spread is wider than before) which should be matched by increased\neffort (volume should be higher than on the previous candle) – and so it is. Therefore, once again, the price\naction on the candle has been validated by the volume. But, in addition to that simple observation, the three\ncandles themselves are now validating the price trend.\nIn other words, the price over the three bars has moved higher, developed into a trend, and the volume is rising\nand NOW validating the trend itself. After all, just as effort vs result applies to one candle, it also applies to a\n'trend' which in this case consists of three candles. Therefore, if the price is moving higher in the trend, then\naccording to Wyckoff's third law, we should expect to see rising volume as well. And this is the case.\nThe point is this. Effort vs result, applies not only to the individual candles we looked at earlier, but also to the\ntrends which start to build once we put the candles together. In other words we have two levels of validation (or\nanomaly).\n",

      "text": "The first level is based on the price/volume relationship on the candle itself. The second level is based on the\ncollective price/volume relationship of a group of candles, which then start to define the trend. It is in the latter\nwhere Wyckoff's second law of ‘cause and effect’ can be applied. Here the extent of the effect (price changes in\ntrend) will be related to the size of the cause (the volume and period over which it is applied - the time element).\nIn this simple example, we have a very neat picture. The price action on each candle has been validated with\nthe associated volume, and the overall price action has been validated by the overall volume action. This can\nall be summed as rising prices = rising volume. If the market is rising, and we see rising volume associated with\nthe move, then this is a valid move higher, supported by market sentiment and the specialists. In other words,\nthe specialists and insiders are joining in the move, and we see this reflected in the volume.\nFig 4.15 Multiple Bar Validation In Down Trend\nI now want to examine the opposite, and look at an example where we have a market which is falling as shown\nin Fig 4.15.\nIn this case the market is moving lower, and perhaps this is where some of the confusion starts for new VPA\nstudents. As humans, we are all familiar with gravity and the concept that it takes effort for something to move\nhigher. The rocket into space, a ball thrown into the air, all require effort to overcome the force of gravity. As\ntraders, these examples of gravity are fine in principle when the market is moving higher, as in our first example.\nWhere these examples using gravity fail, is when we look at markets which are falling, because here too we\nneed rising effort (volume) for the market to fall.\nThe market requires effort to both rise AND fall, and it is easier to think of in these terms.\nIf the specialists are joining in the move, whether higher or lower, then this will be reflected in the volume bars. If\nthey are joining a move higher, then the volume will be rising, and equally if they are joining a move lower, then\nthe volume bars will ALSO be rising in the same way.\nThis is Wyckoff's third rule again – effort vs result, and whether the price action is higher or lower, then this rule\napplies.\n",

      "text": "Looking at the four candles in the example in Fig 4.15, the first down candle opens and closes with a narrow\nspread. The associated volume is small, and therefore validates the price action. The next bar opens and\ncloses with a wider spread, but with higher volume than on the previous candle, so once again the price action\nis valid.\nThe third candle opens and closes with higher volume, as we expect, and finally we come to our last candle\nwhich is wider still, but the associated volume is also higher than all the previous candles. Once again, not only\nhas volume validated each individual candle, it has also validated the group of four candles as a whole.\nAgain we have two levels of validation. First, we check the individual candle and the associated volume for\nvalidation or anomaly. Second, we check to see a validation or anomaly in the trend itself.\nOne of the questions that hasn’t been answered in either of the above examples is this – is the volume buying\nor selling? And, this is the next question we ALWAYS ask ourselves as the market moves along.\nIn the first example in Fig 4.14, we had a market that was rising nicely with the volume also rising to support the\nprice action, so the volume here must all be buying volume, after all, if there were any selling volume, then this\nwould be reflected somewhere in the price action.\nWe know this because there are no wicks on the candles, as the price moves steadily higher, with the volume\nrising to support the price action and validating the price. It can only be buying volume and a genuine move.\nTherefore, we can happily join in, knowing that this is a genuine move in the market. We join the insiders and\nbuy!\nBut perhaps much more importantly – it is also a low risk trading opportunity. We can enter the market with\nconfidence. We have completed our own analysis, based on volume and price. No indicators, no EAs, just price\nand volume analysis. It's simple, powerful and effective, and reveals the true activity within the market. Market\nsentiment is revealed, market tricks are revealed and the extent of market moves are also revealed.\nRemember, there are only two risks in trading. The financial risk on the trade itself. This is easy to quantify and\nmanage using simple money management rules, such as the 1% rule. The second risk is far more difficult to\nquantify, and this is the risk on the trade itself. This is what VPA is all about. It allows you to quantify the risk on\nthe trade using this analytical technique, and when combined with all the other techniques you will learn in this\nbook, is immensely powerful, and even more so when combined with analysis in multiple time frames.\nAs a result, you will become much more confident as a trader. Your trading decisions will be based on your own\nanalysis, using common sense and logic, based on two leading indicators, namely price and volume.\nTo return to our second example in Fig 4.15 and the questions we ask ourselves here. Is the volume buying or\nselling, and should we join the move?\nHere we have a market which is moving firmly lower, with the volume validating the candles and the overall\nprice action. We have no wicks to any candles, and the market is falling with rising volume. Therefore, this must\nbe a valid move and all the volume must be selling volume, as the specialists are joining in the move and\nselling. Market sentiment is firmly bearish.\nAgain, another low risk opportunity to enter the market, based on common sense, logic and an understanding of\nthe price and volume relationship.\nI now want to round off this chapter on the first principles of VPA by considering multiple candles with an\nanomaly. In the examples that follow, there is more than one anomaly, as we are considering the concept of\nVPA on two levels. The first level is that applied to each candle, the second level is to the overall trend.\n",

This is also signalling\nclearly that the previous volume is also an anomaly, (if any further evidence were required).\nCandle 4 Two Anomalies Again!\nAgain, we have two anomalies in one, and is adding further confirmation that the volume and price on this trend\nare no longer in agreement. Here we have a wide spread up candle and even lower volume than on previous\ncandles in the trend. Following the effort vs result rule, we would expect to see significantly higher volume, but\ninstead we have low volume.\nSecond, the falling volume is confirming that we have an anomaly on the trend, as we expect to see rising\nvolume with a rising trend, whereas here we have falling volumes on a rising trend. The alarm bells would be\nringing loud and clear now.\nWhat are the conclusions we can draw from these four candles? The problems start with candle two. Here we\nhave effort, but not an equivalent result in terms of the associated price action. This is therefore the first sign of\npossible weakness. The market is what is known as 'over bought'. The market makers and specialists are\nstarting to struggle here. The sellers are moving into the market sensing an opportunity to short the market. This\ncreates the resistance to higher prices at this level, which is then confirmed on the third and fourth candles,\nwhere volume is falling away.\nThe specialists and market makers have seen this weakness, and are selling out themselves at this level,\npreparing for a move lower, but continue to mark prices higher, to give the appearance of a market that is still\nbullish. It is not. This may only be a temporary pause, and not a major change in trend, but nevertheless, it is a\nwarning of potential weakness in the market.\nThe high volume is as a result of an increasing number of sellers closing out their positions, and taking their\nprofits, whilst the remaining buyers do not have sufficient momentum to take the market higher. The specialists\nand market makers are also selling out at this level adding to the volumes, as they have seen the weakness in\nthe market. This is the reason that volumes fall on the next two candles, as they continue to mark the market\nhigher, but are no longer involved in the move themselves. They have withdrawn and are trapping traders into\nweak positions.\nThe initial weakness appeared on candle two, which was then FURTHER confirmed by candles three and four.\nThis is often the sequence of events that unfolds.\nInitially we see an anomaly appear using the single candle analysis. We then wait for subsequent candles to\nappear, and analyse them against the initial anomaly. In this case, the anomaly was confirmed, with prices\ncontinuing to rise on falling volumes.\nNow we have a market which is apparently weak, and confirmed as such. The next step is to move to the final\nlevel in our analysis which is to consider the analysis in the broader context of the chart. This will determine\nwhether what we are seeing is a minor pull back, or the pre-cursor to a change in trend.\nThis is where Wyckoff's second rule comes into effect, the law of cause and effect. If this is simply a minor pull\nback or reversal, then the cause will be small, and the effect will be small.\nIn point of fact, the anomaly we have seen here, might be enough to result in minor short term weakness, a pull\nback due to one weak candle. The cause is weak, so the effect is weak. Before expanding further on this latter\nin the book, let us look at one more example of multiple bar anomalies.\n",

What this is signalling is that the market is clearly resistant to any move lower. After all, it this was NOT the\ncase, then the price spread would he been much wider, to reflect the high volume. But, this is not the case, and\nis therefore an anomaly. And, just as in the previous example, the alarm bells are now ringing.

This is the reason that volumes fall on the next\ntwo candles, as they continue to mark the market lower, but are no longer involved in the move themselves.\nThey have bought their stock on candle 2, and are now simply trapping additional traders into weak short\npositions in candles 3 and 4.\nThe initial signal appeared on candle two, as in the previous example, which was then FURTHER confirmed in\ncandles three and four. The insiders have shown their hand on candle two in both of the above examples, and\nall from the volume and associated price action!\nIn both of these examples we would now be ready and waiting for any further signals, to give us clues as to the\nlikely extent of any reversal in trend, or whether this might simply be a minor pull back. Even if it were merely a\nminor change in a longer term trend, this would still offer a low risk trade that we could enter in the knowledge\nthat the position would only be open for a short time.\nThis brings me neatly to the point I mentioned earlier, namely the framework of Wyckoff's second law, the law of\ncause and effect.\nIn learning to base our trading decisions using VPA, the analytical process that we go through on each chart is\nidentical. The description of this process may sound complicated, but in reality once mastered only takes a few\nminutes to execute. In fact, it becomes second nature. It took me around 6 months to reach this level by chart\nwatching every day. You may be quicker or a little slower – it doesn't matter, as long as you follow the principles\nexplained in the book. The process can be broken down into three simple steps:\nStep 1 – Micro\nAnalyse each price candle as it arrives, and look for validation or anomaly using volume. You will quickly\ndevelop a view on what is low, average, high or very high volume, just by considering the current bar against\nprevious bars in the same time frame.\nStep 2 - Macro\nAnalyse each price candle as it arrives against the context of the last few candles, and look for validation of\nminor trends or possible minor reversals.\nStep 3 - Global\nAnalyse the complete chart. Have a picture of where the price action is in terms of any longer term trend. Is the\nprice action at the possible top or bottom of a longer term trend, or just in the middle? This is where support and\nresistance, trend lines, candle patterns, and chart patterns all come into play, and which we will cover in more\ndetail shortly.\nIn other words, we focus on one candle first, followed by the adjacent candles close by, and finally the entire\nchart. It's rather like the zoom lens on a camera in reverse – we start close in on our subject, and then gradually\nzoom out for the complete picture.\nI now want to put this into the context of Wyckoff's second law, namely the law of cause and effect, as this is\nwhere the elements of time come into our VPA analysis.\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, one of the classic mistakes I made time and time again when first starting all\nthose years ago was to assume that as soon as I saw a signal, then the market would turn. I was caught out\n",

      "text": "repeatedly, getting in too early, and being stopped out. The market is like the proverbial oil tanker – it takes time\nto turn and for all the buying or selling to be absorbed before the insiders, specialists and market makers are\nready. Remember, they want to be sure that when they make their move, then the market will not be resistant. In\nthe simple examples above, we just looked at four candles, with the insiders moving in on just one. In reality,\nand as you will see shortly, there is a great deal more to it than this, but this sets the basic principle in place,\nwhich is what this chapter is all about.\nTherefore, on a daily chart this ‘mopping up’ phase could go on for days, weeks and sometimes even months,\nwith the market continuing to move sideways. Several consecutive signals of a reversal could appear, and\nwhilst it is clear that the market will turn, it is not clear when this will occur. The longer this period of\nconsolidation, then the more extended any reversal in trend is likely to be. And, this is the point that Wyckoff\nwas making in his second law, the law of cause and effect. If the cause is large, in other words the period over\nwhich the market is preparing to reverse, then the more dramatic and long lasting will be the consequent trend.\nLet's try to put this concept into context as this will also explain the power of using VPA combined with multiple\ntime frames.\nIf we take one of the simple examples above, where we were looking at four candles, and the associated\nvolume bars. This is really step two in our three step process. Here we are at the macro level, and this could be\non any chart from a tick chart to a daily chart. All we know is that over this four bar period there is a possible\nchange being signalled. However, given the fact that this is only over a handful of candles, any reversal is\nunlikely to last long as any potential change is only based on a few candles. In other words, what we are\nprobably looking at here in the micro stage, is a minor pull back or reversal. Nothing wrong with that, and\nperfectly acceptable as a low risk trading opportunity.\nHowever, step back to the global view on the same chart, and we see this in the context of the overall trend, and\nimmediately see that this four bar price action is in fact being replicated time and time again at this level, as the\nmarket prepares to reverse. In other words, the cause is actually much greater than a simple reversal and we\nare therefore likely to see a much greater effect as a result. Therefore, patience is now required and we must\nwait. But, wait for what? Well, this is where the power of support and resistance comes into play, and which I\ncover in detail in a later chapter.\nReturning to Wyckoff’s second law of cause and effect and how this principle can be applied to multiple time\nframes, the strategy I would like to share with you is one I use in my own trading. It is based on a typical set of\ncharts on MT4 and uses the 5, 15 and 30 minute charts. This trio of charts is for intra day forex scalping and\ntrades are taken on the 15 minute chart. The 5 minute chart gives me a perspective closer to the market, whilst\nthe 30 minute chart, gives me a longer term view on a slower chart. The analogy I always use in my trading\nrooms is that of a three lane highway. The 5 minute chart is in the middle while the two charts either side acting\nas 'wing mirrors' on the market. The faster time frame, the 5 minute chart, tells us what is happening in the 'fast\nlane', whilst the 30 minute reveals what is happening in the 'slow lane', the slower time frame.\nAs the sentiment in the fast time frame changes, if it ripples through to the slower time frames, then this will\ndevelop into a longer term trend. For example, if a change occurs on the 5 minute chart, which then ripples\nthrough to the 15 minute chart, and ultimately through to the 30 minute chart, then this change has now\ndeveloped into a longer term trend.\nReturning to our VPA analysis. Imagine that on the 5 minute chart we see an anomaly of a possible change in\ntrend which is then confirmed. This change in trend is also reflected in the 15 minute chart. If we take a trade on\nthe analysis seen here, and the trend ultimately ripples through to the 30 minute chart, this reversal is likely to\nbe more developed as a result, as it has taken longer to build, and is therefore likely to have further to run. The\nanalogy I use here is of a clockwork model car.\nIf we only wind the mechanism by a few turns which takes a few seconds, then the car only runs a small\ndistance before stopping. If we spend a little longer and add a few more turns to the mechanism then the car\nruns further. Finally, if we take a few minutes and wind the mechanism to the maximum, the car will now run the\nfarthest distance possible. In other words, the time and effort we put in to define the strength of the cause, will be\noutput in terms of the strength of the effect.\nThis is the power of VPA when used in multiple time frames and in conjunction with Wyckoff's second rule. It is\n",

      "text": "Chapter Five\nVolume Price Analysis: Building The Picture\nMistakes are the best teachers. One does not learn from success.\nMohnish Pabrai ( 1964 -)\nIn the previous chapter we looked at some of the basic building blocks of VPA, and how to apply our analysis\nfirst to single candles, and then to use this knowledge in relation to small groups of candles. This really took us\nthrough the first two steps of VPA in our three step process. The three step process which begins with a close\nup look at one candle, then gradually zooms out, to step 2 which is the candles in close proximity to the latest\ncandle. Finally, we zoom out to bring the complete chart into focus, which is what we are going to focus on in\nthis chapter, and in doing so, I hope will also help to reinforce the basic skills we learnt in the previous chapter.\nIn addition in this chapter, I'm also going to introduce some new concepts which I hope will help to put\neverything into context, and pull the various strands of VPA together. I think this is probably the best place to\nstart, and then we can begin to look at a variety of examples, and I can walk you through each chart as the price\naction unfolds.\nSo let me start with five concepts which lie at the heart of VPA, and these are as follows:\n \n1. Accumulation\n2. Distribution\n3. Testing\n4. Selling Climax\n5. Buying Climax\nThe simplest way to understand these terms, and for me to explain them to you, is to go back to our analogy of\nthe warehouse, which was also used by Richard Ney in his books to explain this concept. This is what he said:\n“To understand the specialists' practices, the investor must learn to think of specialists as merchants who want\nto sell an inventory of stock at retail price levels. When they clear their shelves of their inventory they will\nseek to employ their profits to buy more merchandise at wholesale price levels.”\nI used the same analogy in my article for Working Money magazine many years later, which was the Parable of\nUncle Joe.\nThe easiest way to think of volume in terms of the market price action, and this applies to all markets, is to use\nthe wholesaling analogy. However, in order to keep things simple, let's just refer to the specialists, the market\nmakers, the large operators, the professional money, as the insiders from now on. So, the insiders are the\nmerchants who own the warehouses of stock and their primary goal is to make money buy buying at wholesale\nprices and then selling at retail prices.\nRemember also, in the following explanations, that in my VPA Principle No 2, the market always takes time to\nturn in a dramatic way, and this is also borne out in Wyckoff's second law of cause and effect. We are always\ngoing to see small changes up and down, as the market pulls back or reverses in a longer term trend. But, for\nthe major changes in trend to occur, (and remember, a 'major change' can appear on a 5 minute chart or a 1 day\nchart) this takes time. The longer the time taken, (the cause), the greater the change (the effect). However, this\ndoes vary from market to market. Some markets may take days, weeks or even months, before they are ready to\nturn dramatically, whilst other markets may take just a few days. I will be covering this later in the book, once we\nstart to look at the various nuances which apply to specific markets, as they all behave slightly differently.\nThe key principles described here still apply. It's just the time frames and speed at which events occur that\nchanges dramatically, and is due to the different structure of each market, the role of the insiders in that market,\nand the role that each capital market plays as an investment or speculative vehicle.\n",

Our simple examples in the previous\nchapter, were just to introduce the basic principles.\nWhat happens next is that anyone who survived the first wave of selling is relieved, believing the market will\nrecover and they continue to hold. After a period of calm, more bad news arrives, and the insiders take prices\nlower once again, shaking more holders out of the market. As they buy again there is a consequent recovery in\nthe price.\nThis price action is then repeated several times, each time the insiders accumulating more and more stock for\ntheir warehouse, until finally the last stock holders give up, and admit defeat. What does this look like on the\nprice chart?\nFig 5.10 The Accumulation Phase\nWhilst Fig 5.10 is a graphical representation of the price action, nevertheless I hope it gives a sense of what this\nlooks like on a real chart. The repeated buying by the insiders is highlighted in blue.\nI have deliberately avoided using a scale on the chart, either in terms of price or time, as I believe it is the\n'shape' of the price and associated volume bars which is important. This is the price action which creates the\nclassic price congestion which we see in all time frames, and which is why this ‘shape’ is so powerful, when\nassociated with volume. This is what gives price action, the three dimensional perspective using VPA.\nOnce the campaign has begun, the price action then follows this typical pattern, where the market is repeatedly\nmoved higher and lower. This type of price action is essential to 'shake' sellers out of the market. We can think\nof this as shaking fruit from a tree, or as we do in Italy, harvesting the olives! The tree has to be shaken\nrepeatedly in order for all the crop to fall. Some of the crop is more firmly attached and takes effort to release.\nThis is the same in the financial markets. Some holders will refuse to sell, despite this constant whipsaw action,\nbut eventually they give up after several 'false dawns', generally on the point when the campaign is almost over,\n",

      "text": "with the insiders preparing to take the market higher with fully stocked warehouses. So the campaign comes to\nan end. It is all over, until the next time!\nThis is repeated over and over again, in all time frames and in all markets. If we take the cause and effect rule of\nWyckoff, the above price action could be a 'secondary' phase in a much longer term cycle, which is something I\ncover in more detail once we start to look at multiple time frames.\nEverything, as Einstein said, is relative.\nIf we took a 50 year chart of an instrument, there would be hundreds of accumulation phases within the 50 year\ntrend. By contrast an accumulation phase in a currency pair, might last a few hours, or perhaps only a few days.\nAnd the reason for this difference is to do with the nature and structure of market. The equity market is a very\ndifferent market to bonds and commodities. In equities for example, this phase might last days, weeks or\nmonths, and I cover this in detail when we look at the characteristics of each market and its internal and external\ninfluences, which create the nuances for us as VPA traders.\nThe key point is this. Just recognise the price action and associated volume for what it is. This is the insiders\nmanipulating the market in preparation for an extended price move higher. It may be a small move (cause and\neffect) based on a short time period, or a more significant move based on a longer phase. And if you think that\nperhaps this is a fantasy, let me just quote from Richard Ney again, and this time from his second book, The\nWall Street Gang.\n“On November 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was assassinated, specialists used the alibi provided by\nthe tragedy to clean out their books down to wholesale price levels. After they had accumulated large\ninventories of stock, they closed shop for the day and walked off the floor. This prevented public buy orders from\nbeing executed at the day's lows. The specialist in Telephone, for example, dropped his stock on November 22\nfrom $138 to $130. He opened it on the 25th at $140! Sacrificing accuracy for expediency, he admitted to\nmaking $25,000 for his trading account.”\nAny news, provides the perfect excuse to manipulate the market, and nothing is exempt. In US equities it is the\nquarterly earnings season reports which provide the perfect opportunity. Economic data is also a rich source,\nwhilst natural disasters can be used for longer term triggers. On an intra day basis, accumulation is made very\neasy with the constant round of comments from politicians, central banks, coupled with the daily stream of\neconomic data. Life is very easy for the insiders, and to be honest, if we had the opportunity, we would probably\ndo the same thing as well!\nThe Distribution Phase\nThe distribution phase is the exact opposite of the accumulation phase. In the accumulation phase, the insiders\nwere filling their warehouses, in preparation for the next phase of the operation, and as I said earlier, the word\ncampaign is perfect. This is a military campaign with nothing left to chance, as we will see shortly when I\nexplain about testing.\nWith a full warehouse, the insiders now need to start moving the price higher, to encourage the somewhat\nnervous and jaundiced buyers back into the market. This is one reason why the insiders dare not frighten\neveryone too much, as they simply cannot afford to kill the goose that lays the golden egg!\nWhilst the key emotional driver in 'shaking the trees' in the accumulation phase was fear, the fear of a loss, the\nkey driver that is used in the distribution phase is also fear, but this time the fear of missing out on a good trade.\nThe timing here is critical, as the insiders know that most investors and speculators are nervous, and like to wait\nfor as many confirming signals as possible, before jumping into a market, fearing they will miss out on a big\nmove higher. This is the reason most traders and investors buy at a top and sell at a bottom.\nAt the top of a bullish trend, traders and investors have seen the market move higher slowly, then gather\nmomentum, before rising fast, and it is at this point that they buy, fearful of missing out on any 'quick profits'. This\nis precisely the point at which the insiders are preparing to pause and reverse. The same happens at the bottom\nof the accumulation phase. The investors and speculators can take no more pain and uncertainty, they have\nseen the market move lower slowly, then gather pace before dropping fast, which triggers waves of panic sales.\nCalm is then restored and the market starts to move into the accumulation phase.

This is the way that the insiders manipulate\ntrader fear, and in many ways we could argue that it is not the markets they manipulate at all, but trader\nemotions, which are much easier.\nSo what is the typical pattern for our distribution phase, and how is it managed?\nFirst, the market breaks out from the end of the accumulation phase, moving higher steadily, with average\nvolume. There is no rush as the insiders have bought at wholesale prices and now want to maximise profits by\nbuilding bullish momentum slowly, as the bulk of the distribution phase will be done at the top of the trend, and\nat the highest prices possible.

Panic selling follows with high volumes\nin this area. The insiders then begin to shake the trees for the more obstinate 'fruit' before they slowly begin to\npush the market out from this region and to start the gentle upwards trend, which will ultimately develop into the\ndistribution phase at the top of the bull trend.\nAt this point the insiders are moving the market back through an area of recent heavy selling, and the worst\nthing that could happen, is for this selling pressure to return, bringing the campaign to a shuddering halt. The\nanswer is to execute a test in the rising market which is shown in the schematic in Fig 5.12.\nThe market is marked lower, possibly on the back of a minor item of bad news, to test to see if this is likely to\nflush out any remaining sellers. If the volume remains low, this instantly tells the insiders that there are few\nsellers left, and that virtually all the selling has been absorbed in the accumulation phase of the campaign. After\nall, if the sellers were still in the market in any number, then the candle would have closed lower on above\naverage volume. The volume is low, as the insiders move the candle back near the opening price with a 'good\nnews' story, before continuing higher, happy with this positive result.\nThese so called 'low volume' tests occur in all time frames and in all markets, and is a simple way for the\ninsiders to gauge the balance of supply in the market. They are, after all, trying to create demand here, but if\nthere is an over supply in the market then this will bring the bull campaign to a halt.\nIn this case the test was successful and confirms that any selling pressure has been removed. The precise\nformation of the candle is not critical, but the body must be a narrow spread, with a deep lower wick. The colour\nof the body can be either bullish or bearish.\nWith the test now confirmed the insiders can move the market higher to the target distribution level, confident\nthat all the old selling has now been absorbed.\n",

In\nstarting to move the market away from the accumulation area, and executing the first part of the test by marking\nprices lower, this has resulted in sellers returning in large numbers and forcing the price lower.\nClearly on this occasion, the selling from the old trading range has not been absorbed in the accumulation\nphase, so any further attempt to take the market higher may struggle or fail.\nA failed test means only one thing. The insiders will have to take the market back lower once again, and\nquickly, to shake these sellers out. The market is not ready to rise further, and the insiders therefore have more\nwork to do, before the campaign can be re-started. This is equivalent to a failed test in an advertising campaign.\nPerhaps the pricing of the product is not quite right, or the marketing message is not clear. Either way, the test\nhas shown that something isn’t right and needs to be addressed. For the insiders it's the presence of too many\nsellers still in the market.\nThe original 'mopping up' campaign needs to be restarted, to absorb these old positions. The insiders will then\nrelaunch their campaign again, and re-test the supply as the market begins to rise. On a failed test we can\nexpect to see the insiders take the market back into the congestion area once again, to flush out this selling\npressure before preparing to breakout again, with a further test.

      "text": "insiders?\nThe second question is – over what time frames do these cycles of filling and emptying the warehouse typically\nlast?\nLet me answer the first, which also leads into the second. Market insiders only have two objectives. The first is\nmake us fearful and the second is to make us greedy. They have no purpose in life, other than to create\nemotional responses which will ensure that we always do the wrong thing at the wrong time, but they always do\nthe right thing at the right time.\nA quote from the late great John Templeton who wrote:\n“Heed the words of the great pioneer of stock analysis Benjamin Graham: ‘Buy when most people…including\nexperts…are pessimistic, and sell when they are actively optimistic.’”\nLet's think about this logically and try to answer the first question. The markets have been in free fall, with panic\nselling by investors and traders. Then comes a period of calm as the market moves sideways into the\naccumulation phase, as the warehouses are stocked up ready for the move higher.\nNow at this stage, remember, that from an insiders point of view, they have just frightened everyone to death,\nand the last thing they want to do, is to suddenly send the market soaring in the opposite direction. This would\nsoon drive every investor and speculator away. After all, there is only so much emotion that traders can take,\nand too much too soon would quickly kill the goose that lays the golden egg. A calm approach is required. The\ntactic now is to quietly start to build confidence back up, moving prices higher steadily, without frightening\nanyone out of the market, and gradually drawing the buyers back in.\nSoon, the panic selling is forgotten as the markets recover and confidence is slowly restored. This also suits the\ninsiders, as they have a full inventory to sell, and want to take their time, and certainly don't want to see large\nvolume buying as they move the market higher. At this stage, it is is about maximising profits, and the biggest\nprofits are to be made once the distribution target price levels are reached at the retail level. It would be\nmadness to suddenly mark up the market to the retail level, as many investors would then feel they had missed\nout on the move, and not join in later.\nThe strategy here is one of confidence building by taking the market higher slowly, and then gradually to move\nfaster, generating the belief in the investor or speculators mind that this is a market with momentum, which is\ngathering pace all the time, and is an opportunity not to be missed to make some easy money.\nThe upwards trend then starts to gather pace, moving higher in steps, pausing, reversing a little, drawing in\nbuyers, tempting others, then moving higher still, until close to the distribution area, the market picks up speed\nas buyers crack under the emotional pressure of missing out, and jump in.\nThroughout the upwards journey, the inventory is gradually reduced, but topped up in minor reversals with\nsellers taking their profits, and helping to maintain levels for the final phase of the campaign.\nThis is the emotional journey that the insiders have mastered. It is the reason markets move higher in a series of\nhigher highs and higher lows, with pauses and minor reversals along the way. It is a confidence building\nexercise, designed to restore confidence after the fear, and replace it with another emotion – greed. These are\nthe two levers that the insiders have, and they are used to devastating effect, and the only weapon that you\nhave in your armoury is VPA.\nAfter greed comes fear – again!\nWith their warehouses now empty, the insiders need to get back to the 'bottom' and fill them up as quickly as\npossible. Again, we would do exactly the same thing in their position.\nHowever, the insiders have nothing to sell now, and the only way to make money fast is to refill the warehouse\nagain and begin another campaign. The market crashes lower, panic selling ensues, fear is triggered and the\nwarehouses are filled once more. And so the cycle repeats, time and time and time again. The best analogy I\ncan think of here is of an old fashioned helter skelter that we might see at a fair ground. It takes effort to get to\nthe top, walking up all the steps, but the slide down on a mat is very quick! That's how the markets work. Up in\nstairs and down in elevators. The old fashioned board game of ‘snakes and ladders’ expresses this effect\n",

      "text": "perfectly, it’s up on the ladders, and then a slide all the way back down on the snake!\nI hope this is now beginning to make sense, as it is only once we start to think of the markets in these terms that\nwe begin to realise how anyone, other than the insiders, ever makes money. This is another point. The insiders\nhave to be careful, for the simple reason that if the price action was continually and unrelentingly volatile, then\ntraders and investors would look elsewhere for investing and speculating opportunities.\nJust like Goldilocks and her porridge, the motto here is 'not too hot and not too cold'. The insiders have learnt\ntheir craft and honed their skills over decades. Most investors and speculators lose. You are lucky. By the end\nof this book you will become a VPA expert and be able to see and recognise all the tricks they play. They are\nthere in plain sight and all we have to do is interpret the signals and then follow the insiders. It really is that\nsimple.\nMoving to the second question which was how often is this cycle repeated? And here I will let you into a secret.\nThis was a question I wanted to ask Albert Labos all those years ago as we sat in a rusty cabin on the President\nlearning all about the market makers (as he referred to them) and their tricks. I actually wrote down the question\nand asked my neighbour in the class, but he didn't know the answer either.\nWhat I thought at the time was this. I understood about the accumulation and distribution phases which made\nperfect sense to me, but then I started to think. Also, remember that at the time we were really looking at trading\nindices, so essentially long cycles. I thought to myself that if the cycle was perhaps 10, 15, or 20 years, then this\nwas a long time for a market maker to wait to make a profit from his (or her) buying and selling. Perhaps it was\nlonger, and from one big market crash to another. Perhaps it was decades? I didn't dare ask the question at the\ntime, and now I wish I had!\nThe answer to the question is that these cycles occur on all time frames from tick charts, to 1 minute charts, to\n15 minute and hourly charts, and to daily, weekly and monthly charts. The best way to think of this is to imagine\na set of nested Russian dolls.\nThe smallest doll, fits inside a slightly larger doll, which fits inside a larger doll, and so on. In the context of\nthese cycles, we can imagine the same thing with a chart. An accumulation and distribution cycle on a one\nminute chart, may last a few hours, and be part of a larger cycle on a slower time frame chart, which in turn itself\nwill be part of a larger cycle and so on. This is an important concept to grasp, as it brings in two important\naspects of market behaviour.\nFirst, that these cycles happen in ALL time frames, and second that by watching price action across multiple\ntime frames you will start to see these cycles developing and unfolding and confirming one another as a result.\nA cycle that has already started on a one minute chart, will be setting up on 5 minute chart, and possibly just\ndeveloping on the 15 minute chart.\nLet me quote from Richard Ney again and his book The Wall Street Gang, books every trader and investor\nshould try to read. They contain a wealth of information, and they give us a broad perspective on volume and\nprice, along with an excellent view on how the specialists manipulate the markets. Whilst the books primarily\nfocus on stocks, the principles are identical and relevant to all markets. In equities it's the specialists, insiders or\nmarket markets, in futures it's the large operators, and in spot forex it's the market makers again.\nThis is what he says about time frames :\n“The specialist's objectives can be classified in terms of the short, intermediate and long term. Thus we can see\nthat there are three broad classifications into which we can place the market's price movements.\nHe then goes on to say\n“The short term trend. This can last from two days to two months. Within this trend there can be even shorter\nterm trends lasting no more than several hours. The importance of the short term trend is that it is within this\ncontext that the specialist resolves his day to day inventory problems with his intermediate and long term\nobjectives always in view. It is as though the short term trend is the spade with which the specialist digs the\ninvestor's intermediate and long term grave.”\n“The ticker tape provides us with a microscopic view of the techniques of big block distribution at the top and big\n",

Following the selling climax, the market then breaks lower, and fast. This tranche of buyers,\nalong with all the others, is then trapped at this price level, as the insiders move the market away from this\nregion and back down the helter skelter to begin the process again.\nLet's look at a typical example of what we might see as the selling climax marks the end of the distribution\nphase, and we can think of it in terms of fireworks – this is a firework display which marks the end of the event!\nOnce again, Fig 5.16 is simply a schematic of what to expect in the selling climax.

The next leg is in the opposite direction.\nFinally, the inventory is cleared and the market sells off, moving lower and back out of the distribution phase.\nThe clues for us, as VPA experts, are there to see.\nHere we will see high volume coupled with a candlestick which has a deep upper wick and narrow body, and is\none of the most powerful combinations of price action and volume we will ever see on a chart.

The insiders are having one last effort\nto clear their inventory and mark prices higher early in the session. Buyers flood in, taking the market higher,\nfearful of missing out, with high or ultra high volumes, before the insiders take the market lower to lock these\ntraders into weak positions, helped lower by profit taking. Some traders will sense that the market is 'over\nbought' at this level.\nThis price action is repeated several times, with the insiders selling into the demand, each time the price is\npushed higher, before closing the candle lower at or near the opening price, helped by profit takers closing out.\nThe colour of the body of the candle is unimportant. What is important, is the height of the wick, the repeated\nnature of this price action, and the associated high volumes. This is sending a clear signal that the market is\nready to move fast, and as the warehouses are all empty, the reaction will be quick. The insiders are now\njumping on their mats, and heading off down the helter skelter, back to 'square one' to begin the process once\nagain with an accumulation phase. When we see this price action, following a distribution phase, it's best to be\nin front of your screen – ready and waiting! Now let's look at the opposite of the selling climax, which is the\nbuying climax. This is the firework party that marks the end of the accumulation phase, and signals the start of\nthe bullish trend higher.\n \nFig 5.17 The Buying Climax – Firework Show ( Again!)\nThe buying climax is simply a selling climax in reverse. The insiders have taken the market lower, panic has\nbeen triggered and fearful sellers are closing positions.

      "text": "Towards the end of this phase, the insiders than mark prices down rapidly, flushing out more sellers, before\nmoving the price higher later in the session to close somewhere near the opening price, helped higher by their\nown buying in the market, with bargain hunters also sensing that the market is 'over sold' at this level.\nThis is repeated several times, with panic selling continuing as frightened investors and speculators can take\nno more. They capitulate and throw in the towel. This is the last hurrah.\nThe insiders are now ready, with warehouses over flowing with stock, to start the march north, and begin the\nbullish trend higher, in nice easy steps, towards the target price for distribution.\nOnce we accept the fact that all markets are manipulated in one way or another, then the rest of the story simply\nfits into place.\nThe above is very logical, and common sense, but don't be misled into thinking that this is simply not possible\nwith the current legislative authorities now in place. Nothing much has changed since the days of Wyckoff and\nNey, and here let me quote from 'Making it in the Market' published in 1975.\nThis was a telephone conversation that Richard Ney had with an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)\nofficial. The SEC is supposed to regulate the financial world in the US.\nRemember, this is 1975, and this it what was said on the telephone call, when the official was asked about\nchecks on specialists and how they are regulated:\n“specialists are under the Exchange. We don't get too concerned with them. They're not directly regulated by\nthe Commission. They all operate under self regulation. They make their own rules – the Commission just O.K's\nthem. Only if the Commission feels there is something not proper does it take exception. We check broker-\ndealers but we never go onto the Exchange to check out specialists.”\nSo has anything changed?\nIn reality very little, except to say that trading is now largely electronic, and one of the many problems faced\ntoday by the SEC is HFT or High Frequency Trading.\nThere are the usual cases, where individuals and firms are taken to task to prove that the SEC and others have\nsome sort of control and to assuage the public, that the markets are regulated in a fair and open way.\nSadly, as I hope the above shows, and in using VPA live will quickly prove to you, this is most certainly NOT\nthe case. The insiders are FAR too experienced and wily to allow their golden goose to be killed off. They\nsimply devise new and more elegant ways to manipulate prices for their own ends.\nLet me quote from a recent release from the SEC in response to the issue of HFT :\n“There are a number of different types of HFT techniques, and an SEC Concept Release [6] broke them down\nto four main types of strategies:\nMarket making: like traditional market making, this strategy attempts to make money by providing liquidity on\nboth sides of the book and earning the spread.\nArbitrage: Trading when arbitrage opportunities arise ( e.g. from mis-pricing between Indices, ETF's or ADRs\nand their underlying constituents.\nStructural: These strategies seek to take advantage of any structural vulnerabilities of the market or certain\nparticipants, and include latency arbitrage or quote stuffing.\nDirectional: These strategies attempt to get ahead of – or trigger – a price move, and include order anticipation\nand momentum ignition.”\nAnd the date of this report? - late 2012.\nI don't wish to labor the point, but I am conscious that some people reading this book may still consider me to be\na 'conspiracy theorist'. I can assure you, I am not.\n",

See Fig 5.18\nThe first campaign is the accumulation phase. The insiders start to fill their warehouses, which are empty\nfollowing the sharp move lower, at wholesale prices.\nOnce the warehouses are almost full, the buying climax then begins, with some volatile price action to draw in\nmore stock, but once complete, they then exit from the price region and test for supply. If all the selling has been\nabsorbed, the insiders can start marking the market higher in steps, building confidence back into shell shocked\ninvestors and speculators who are still recovering.\nAs confidence returns, so the trend starts to gather momentum, drawing in buyers who now believe that the\nmarket will 'go to the moon'. Even cautious investors succumb and buy, just as the price is reaching the target\narea for retail prices.\nWith the market now at the retail level, more buyers are sucked in as the distribution phase starts in earnest,\nwith prices moved higher to draw in more buyers, then lower to lock them in to weak positions. Finally the\nselling climax begins, with volatile price action, and the remaining inventory is cleared from the warehouses.\nOnce empty, the market breaks lower, through this price area, and once again a test is executed, this time of\ndemand. If the test confirms that buying in this region has been absorbed then the campaign is complete, and\nthe market is moved lower fast.\nThe cycle is complete, and it only remains for the insiders to count their profits and repeat the exercise, again,\nand again, and again and … well I'm sure you get the picture.\n",

      "text": "Next, whilst the insiders all work together, this is NOT a cartel. There are many hundreds of specialists and\nmarket makers, and this simply would not be feasible. What does happen however, is that the insiders will all\nsee strength and weakness at the same time. They have the advantage of seeing both sides of the market, all\nthe buy orders and all the sell orders, and therefore true market sentiment.\nWhat they cannot hide is volume, which is why it is so powerful. It is the only way we have of seeing when the\ninsiders are involved in the price action, and if they are, whether they are buying or whether they are selling.\nWhen they are buying in the buying climax, we see it, because we have high volumes. When they are selling in\nthe selling climax, we see it, because the volumes are high, and this is what you have to understand. It is the\nvolume which is important not the manipulation element of the VPA, which brings me to another point.\nI am often asked how the insiders decide on the target levels for accumulation and distribution, and this was\nsomething I struggled with myself. Are these just arbitrary levels decided in advance, or is there some logic that\ncan help us to make sense of this aspect of price behaviour. Well the 'make sense' element is really this, which\nalso helps us to understand the price behaviour that we see at these levels.\nOn any price chart, there are levels of price congestion that create the natural levels at which markets could be\nconsidered to be 'over sold' or 'over bought', terms which I introduced earlier in the chapter. These price levels\nare absolutely fundamental to the principles of VPA for two reasons. First, they represent areas where the\nmarket is either likely to find support, or is equally likely to struggle. They define barriers, areas where the\nmarket has paused in the past, and either moved on or reversed from these regions. I will explain these in more\ndetail shortly, but for the time being accept the fact they exist, and are created during the phases of\naccumulation and distribution, as the market moves into sideways consolidation.\nNow these 'phases' of price action appear all over our charts and in every time frame, and the insiders will be\nwell aware of where these are and whether they are well developed areas, or simply minor areas where price in\nthe past has perhaps paused before moving on. In preparing any campaign, the insiders therefore target these\nregions, as potential natural points for accumulation and distribution. This also explains the price action once\nwe finally arrive at these areas.\nLet's start with the distribution phase and consider what is actually happening during the selling climax?\nThe market has risen higher and accelerated on bullish news, and has arrived at the target area, which is\npotentially one where the market can be considered to be 'over sold', in other words, potentially weak and/or\nexhausted. We know this because these are the areas that insiders target before a campaign starts. Following\nthe bullish trend higher, which has been supported with positive news, and increasing numbers of buyers\nentering the market, the insiders now pause at this level, and begin the job of distribution.\nThe initial phase of the distribution is executed purely from the momentum already driven into the market by the\ninsiders, so the volume here will be high but not excessive. On any 'up' candles the volumes here will represent\n'natural' buying by investors and speculators. In other words the insiders are not having to 'force' the market\nhigher at this stage. They are simply selling into demand that has been created during the trend higher, and\nbuyers are now in the 'greed' mindset. Any selling at this level, at this stage is again, 'natural' selling, as holders\nwho have bought into the trend earlier, perceive that the market is perhaps struggling at this level, and decide to\ntake their profits. The key point here is that the associated volumes during this phase are likely to be well above\naverage but not excessive.\nThere will certainly be signals of weakness as we will see shortly, once we start to study the charts in detail, but\nthis first phase of distribution, is what I call the 'natural' phase. This is the insiders simply meeting demand from\ngreedy investors and speculators. Any selling is absorbed back into their inventory, and resold. The news is\nthen used to move the market higher and lower in this range as the warehouse stock continues to dwindle.\nThe final phase is the selling climax, and this is where effort is required by the insiders. Now the market is very\nweak at this level. Perhaps the news is not quite so bullish as before, and the insiders are having to 'force' the\nprice higher, using whatever news they can to pull in more buyers.\nBut with a weak market the buyers are now becoming overwhelmed with the sellers, which is why we see the\nprice action reflected in the candles during the selling climax. The insiders now have a real struggle on their\nhands, desperately trying to keep the market propped up, forcing it higher, desperately selling in large volume to\n",

The action is stopped and\nthe market moves sideways, temporarily.\nMore bad news is then used to send the market lower, where large volumes are bought once again, with the\nmarket rising on the insider buying.

      "text": "Chapter Six\nVolume Price Analysis – The Next Level\nI never argue with the tape.\nJesse Livermore (1877-1940)\nIn the last few chapters we have gradually started to build our knowledge and understanding of VPA, beginning\nwith a very simple analysis of price and volume at the micro level, the ticker tape level if you like. From there,\nwe moved out to consider some simple concepts of price and volume at the macro level, and finally in the last\nchapter, the 'global' view and the cycles of behaviour that markets follow with the ebb and flow of volume as the\ninsiders push and pull the price action, this way and that, using the media as their primary vehicle.\nHowever, as I said at the start of this book, there is nothing new in trading, and volume has been around for over\n100 years. One thing that has changed since, is the introduction of candlesticks as the 'de facto' standard for\nanalysing price action on the chart. All the original books and articles mentioned so far have one thing in\ncommon, namely that the charts use bars to describe the price action. Candlesticks have only been adopted by\nWestern traders since the early 1990’s. Again I was fortunate in having been taught the basics by Albert, and I\nhave used candlesticks ever since for a number of reasons.\nFor me, candles are so much more descriptive than any bar can ever be. VPA with candlesticks is my own\nmethodology. By combining the power of candlesticks with VPA gives us a deeper perspective of market\nbehaviour.\nIn this chapter I want to move to the next level and explain the various candle and candle patterns that we build\ninto our VPA analysis and education. I must stress, that this chapter is NOT intended as another book on\nJapanese candlesticks. There are plenty of those already available, and perhaps I may write one myself in the\nfuture.\nIn this chapter I want to explain those candles and candle pattern combinations which are the ones to watch\nwhen analysing a chart using VPA. We're going to look at lots of examples using schematics before moving to\nactual annotated chart examples in subsequent chapters.\nHowever, before moving forward I would like to explain some broad principles which apply, and which we need\nto keep in mind in any analysis when using candlesticks.\nPrinciple Number One\nThe length of any wick, either to the top or bottom of the candle is ALWAYS the first point of focus because it\ninstantly reveals, impending strength, weakness, and indecision, and more importantly, the extent of any\nassociated market sentiment.\nPrinciple Number Two\nIf no wick is created, then this signals strong market sentiment in the direction of the closing price.\nPrinciple Number Three\nA narrow body indicates weak market sentiment. A wide body represents strong market sentiment.\nPrinciple Number Four\nA candle of the same type will have a completely different meaning depending on where it appears in a price\ntrend. Always reference the candle to the location within the broader trend, or in the consolidation phase.\nPrinciple Number Five\nVolume validates price. Start with the candle, then look for validation or anomalies of the price action by the\nvolume bar.\nSo, let me start with two of the most important candles, the shooting star and the hammer candle.\nThe Shooting Star Candle\n",

      "text": "Price action - weakness.\nThe shooting star candle is one of our three premier candles in VPA that we watch for in all time frames, and in\nall instruments and markets.\nThe price action is revealing weakness, since the price has risen and then fallen to close near the opening\nprice, with the sellers overwhelming the buyers in the session.\nShooting star candles appear in every trend, both bullish and bearish, and at every point within the trend. Their\nappearance DOES NOT signal an immediate reversal. Their appearance signals POTENTIAL WEAKNESS at\nthat point in the price action. The candle will ONLY gain significance based on the associated volume.\nThe shooting star price action appears in every up and down trend. It is the classic signal of weakness, and it is\nonly volume which can give a CLEAR signal as to the relative strength of this weakness, and consequently the\nextent of any reversal. The best way to understand these variants is with some examples.\nIn a bullish up trend any shooting star with below average volume is simply signalling a possible pause in the\nupwards trend, with a potential short term pull back. Following such a signal, we would then be considering the\nprevious and subsequent price action for confirmation of a continuation of the trend.\nAs the trend develops further, this initial weakness may be confirmed further with additional shooting star\ncandles, with average volumes. Once we have two candles of similar proportions in a trend, and in the same\ntime frame, we can then compare volume between the two candles. If the first candle was an initial sign of\nweakness, then the second, with increased volume is confirming this weakness further. After all, if the volume\non the second shooting star is higher than the first, so 'weakness' has increased as more selling is coming to\nthe market and forcing prices lower in the session.\nThis brings me to an important point which I would like to introduce here. It is perhaps an obvious point, but\nnevertheless one which is worth making.\nIf we see one shooting star, this can be taken as a sign of weakness. If we see two consecutive shooting stars,\nor two relatively close to each other, this is increasing the bearish sentiment. If a third appears then this is\nadding yet more bearish sentiment. In other words, single candles are important, multiple appearances of the\nsame candle, in the same price area, exponentially increase the level of bearish or bullish sentiment. And\nremember, this is JUST based on price action alone. Add in the volume aspect and this takes our analysis to\nanother level, which is why I find it so strange that PAT traders don't use volume!\n",

First, we have seen three consecutive\ncandles, whose high has failed at exactly the same price level, so there is weakness in this region. Second we\nhave three shooting stars, which we already know are signs of weakness, and finally we have volume. We have\nrising volume on three identical candles at the same price point on our chart. The market is really struggling at\nthis level, and the last two could certainly be considered part of the selling climax.\nMoreover, if these signals were to appear after a period of sideways price action, then this gives the signals\neven more strength, as we are then validating our VPA analysis with another technique of price analysis, which\nis support and resistance.\nIt is very easy with hindsight to look back and identify tops and bottoms. What is far more difficult is to try and\nidentify major turning points in real time so I have created the schematic in Fig 6.11 to explain how this action\nplays out on a chart.

The market has been trending higher, when a shooting star\ncandle appears on the chart, perhaps it even has above average volume. Does the appearance of this candle\nsignify a major reversal of trend or simply a minor pause and pullback? The answer is, based on this candle, we\ndo not know.\nAll we can say for sure, is that we have seen a bullish trend develop in the previous sessions, and now we have\nsome weakness. We know that the signal has some validity, as it has appeared after the market has been rising\nfor some time, and this is one of the points I was trying to highlight earlier. We have to consider all these signals\nin the context of what has gone before.\nIn this case we had a nice bullish trend developing, when a shooting star candle appeared with above average\nvolume. The chart now has our full attention. What do we do? Do we jump in and take a trade?\nAbsolutely not. As I mentioned earlier the market does not turn on a dime. It pauses, reflects, then rises, pauses\nonce again and then falls.\nWe wait for the next candle to form to see if it is confirming this weakness, perhaps some narrow spread up\ncandles, followed by another shooting star. The appearance of the first shooting star is our cue to sit up and\ntake note. It is our cue to check the subsequent candles for confirmation of the initial weakness, and try to\ndeduce with VPA whether this is a sign of longer term weakness or merely a temporary pause. At this point we\nwould also be considering price congestion areas on the chart for clues. After all, if we are in a price region\nwhere the market has reversed previously, then this too is a strong signal, and in addition may also give some\nclues as to the likely depth of any reversal.\nIn addition, if the price action has only recently broken out from an accumulation phase, then it is unlikely to be\n",

To always consider where we are in the\ncontext of the trend and its relation to recent consolidation phases of price action during which the insiders\nwould have been accumulating. After all, it is very unlikely that a new trend would have been started and then\npromptly reverse, particularly if a successful test had followed. So the context of where the candle comes in\nrelation to the ‘bigger picture’ is important and helps to answer the question.\nThe next step is to check the higher and lower time frames for a broader perspective on this signal and for\ncontext, as well as applying VPA to these timeframes.\nFor example, if this price action had appeared on a one hour chart, and on checking the 15 minute chart, we\ncould see two shooting star candles had formed in that time frame, both with above average volume, this gives\nconfirmation that any reversal may be more significant. Furthermore, the 15 min chart may also have significant\nareas of price congestion which would also contribute to our analysis. All this analysis takes minutes, if not\nseconds while waiting for the next candle to form.\nUsing multiple time frames also gives us a view on the longer term trend, and may also help to answer the\nquestion of whether the appearance of this shooting start candle is merely a minor reversal or the start of a\nlonger term change in trend. This is one of the many advantages of using multiple time frames for chart\nanalysis. Furthermore, using multiple time frames will give a perspective on how long we are likely to be\nholding any position.\nThis makes perfect sense. After all, if the longer term trend is bullish, and we are trading short on a faster time\nframe chart, then it's likely that we will only be holding this position for a limited period of time, as we are trading\nagainst the dominant trend for the session. Once again, this will help to answer the question of whether this is a\ntrend reversal, or simply a minor pause and pull back.\nThere are a variety of techniques to help us ascertain whether the market is at ‘a top’ and these will be outlined\nin detail later in the book. However, I wanted to introduce some of these here. Multiple time frame analysis, VPA\nanalysis, price congestion and candle pattern analysis can all be used to help us answer this question.\nFurthermore, a rising market with falling volume is also a classic sign of weakness.\nThe shooting star may have been preceded with a narrow spread up candle on high volume, again classic\nsigns of weakness, but they still do not answer the question of whether this is a minor pull back or a major\nreversal in trend. To do this we need help, and that help comes from using VPA in other time frames, along with\nthe techniques which you will also discover later.\nOne such technique is the depth and extent of any price congestion as the longer a market moves sideways at\na particular level the more likely a breakout and reversal.\nMoreover, VPA is an art and not a science, which is why trading software cannot do this analysis for us. The\nanalysis we carry out on each candle, candle pattern, associated volumes, and associated price across multiple\ntime frames to assess and determine the dominant trend, is all subjective. Initially it takes time to learn which is\nwhy I have written this book in order to short cut the learning curve for you.\nThe five principles mentioned at the start of this chapter apply to all candles, and all our VPA analysis, but as\nthe shooting star and its opposite number the hammer are so important, I felt it was appropriate to introduce the\nbasic concepts of the next levels of VPA analysis here.\nJust to complete this commentary on the shooting star candle, not only do these appear in up trends, but they\nalso appear in down trends, and here they act as confirmation of weakness, particularly if they appear shortly\nafter the start of the move lower. The appearance of a shooting star candle in a downtrend which follows a\nselling climax could be a test of demand as the market moves lower. Furthermore, if the shooting star is\naccompanied by low volume, and the market had been in sideways congestion for a period following the selling\nclimax, this also confirms the insiders testing demand as the market moves away from the distribution phase.\nThe shooting star is a sign that the market has been pushed higher, but there is no demand so falls back to\nclose, at or near the open.\nShooting star candles may also appear at minor reversals deeper in the trend, as the downwards pressure\npauses and pulls back higher. Here again, if the candle is accompanied with above average volume, it is only\ntelling us one thing, namely the market is still weak, and we have not yet reached the buying climax at the\n",

      "text": "bottom of the trend.\nThis pattern of price action is the insiders selling back to the market some of the inventory they have collected\nfrom panicked sellers who had bailed out earlier. This inventory in the warehouse has to be sold as the market\nmoves lower. After all, the insiders don't like to buy anywhere other than at their target price, in other words, a\nwholesale price.\nSome buyers will come in at these pull backs, thinking the market has bottomed out, and about to turn higher,\nwhilst others continue to sell. This price action occurs all the time in a price waterfall, as the market moves\nlower and fast. The insiders have to stop the fall, pause, push the market higher using the media and sell into\nthe created demand whilst also dealing with the ongoing selling that is continuing to arrive. The volume will\ntherefore be above average or high, showing further weakness to come.\nThe Hammer Candle\nPrice action – strength\nThe hammer is the second of our three 'premier' candles and another classic candle that we look out for in all\nmarkets and time frames. It is the classic candle of strength, for either temporary strength, or as a signal for\nlonger term price reversal.\nA hammer is formed when in a session, the price has fallen, only to reverse and recover to close back near the\nopening price. This is a sign of strength with the selling having been absorbed in sufficient strength for the\nbuyers to overwhelm the sellers, allowing the market to recover. The hammer is so called as it is 'hammering\nout a bottom', and just like the shooting star, is immensely powerful when combined with VPA.\nOnce again, the five principles outlined at the beginning of the chapter apply to the hammer candle, and again it\nis very easy to become over excited as soon as you see this candle. It is so easy to jump into what we think is\ngoing to be a change in trend. If the market has been moving lower fast, which they generally do, it is unlikely\nthat a reversal will take effect immediately. What is far more likely, is that the market will pause, mover higher,\nand then continue lower once again. In other words posting a short squeeze.\nAs we now know, the insiders have to clear inventory which has been sold in the move lower, and the first\nsignal of a pause is the hammer, as the insiders move in to buy, supporting the market temporarily. They may\neven push it higher with a shooting star candle. The hammer is signalling 'forced buying' by the insiders, and\nthe shooting star is signalling 'forced selling' by the insiders. Whilst they do move bearish markets fast, there is\nalways selling that has to be absorbed at higher levels, and this inventory has to be cleared before moving\nlower once again. After all, if this did not happen, the insiders would be left with a significant tranche of\ninventory bought at high prices, and not at wholesale prices.\nA price waterfall will always pause, pull back higher, before continuing lower. As always, volume holds the key,\nand if the volumes have been rising in the price waterfall lower, then this is a strong signal of further weakness\nto come. Therefore, a single hammer will simply not be enough to halt the move lower, even if the volume is\nabove average. As always, the price action that follows is key, as is the price and volume in the associated time\nframes along with any price congestion in the vicinity. This is the same problem as before and the question that\nwe always have to ask, whenever we see a hammer or a shooting star, is whether the price action is signalling\na pause in the longer term trend, or a true reversal in trend.\nThe power of the hammer candle, just like the shooting star, is revealed, once we see a sequence of two or\nthree of these candles accompanied by high or extremely high volume. It is at this point we know, for sure that\nwe are in the realms of a buying climax and only have to be patient and wait for the insiders to complete their\ntask, before they begin to take the market higher.\nFurthermore, we also have to remember that once the buying climax is completed, we are likely to see one or\nmore tests using the hammer candle. These candles may be less pronounced than the true hammer, perhaps\nwith relatively shallow wicks, but the principle will be the same. The open and close will be much the same, and\nthere will always be a wick to the lower body.\nFor a successful test, the volume needs to be low too, and there is also likely to be more than one test in this\nphase. These tests can appear both in the price congestion area of accumulation as well as in the initial phase\n",

      "text": "of any breakout, as the price action moves back into an old area of heavy selling immediately above.\nThese are the two candles which are our number one priority in reading of price and volume. As I'm sure you\nwill recall from the introduction to Volume Price Analysis, all we are looking for, on any candle or sequence of\ncandles, is validation or anomaly. Is the volume validating the price action and what signal is this sending to us,\nor is it an anomaly, and therefore sending us a very different signal.\nIn a sense, there is never an anomaly with a shooting star candle, since the price action is sending a clear\nmessage on it's own. As any price action trader will tell you, this candle is a signal of weakness, in itself. There\nis no other interpretation. The market has risen and then fallen in the session, therefore the market MUST be\nweak. What volume does is put this weakness into context, which is why I have shown the schematic with the\nthree volume bars, low, average and high (or even ultra high). A shooting star with low volume is a sign of\nweakness, but probably not significant, unless it is a test of demand following a selling climax as we start the\ndownwards move lower.\nA shooting star with average volume is telling us there is weakness, it is a relatively strong signal, and the pull\nback may be more significant than in the first example on low volume. Finally, we have the shooting star with\nhigh or ultra high volume and this is where the professional money is now selling out. Whether it's the market\nmakers in stocks and indices, or the big operators in futures, or the market makers in forex, or the big operators\nin bonds, it doesn't matter. The insiders are selling out, and we need to prepare and take note, as a big move is\non the way!\nThe point is this. There is never an anomaly with a shooting star, only ever a validation of the strength of the\nsignal. The volume always confirms the price action with a shooting star, and all we have to do is consider\nwhether it is low, average or high to ultra high, and frame this in terms of the preceding price action across our\ntime frames, and track the subsequent candles as they unfold on the chart.\nThe same points apply to the hammer candle. Once again, there is NEVER an anomaly with a hammer candle.\nThe price action tells us all we need to know. In the session, for whatever reason, the price has moved lower\nand then recovered to close near or at the open. It is therefore a sign of strength, and the volume bar then\nreveals the extent of this strength.\nOnce again, I have shown three hammer candles with three volume bars, low, average and ultra high as we can\nsee in Fig 6.12.\nA hammer with a low volume candle is indicating minor weakness, average volume suggests stronger signs of\na possible reversal, whilst ultra high signals the insiders buying heavily, as part of the buying climax. The\nvolume is giving us clues on how far the market is likely to travel. An average volume bar with a hammer\ncandle, may well give us an intra day scalping opportunity. And there is nothing wrong with that. A low volume\nhammer is simply telling us that any reversal is likely to be minor, as there is clearly little interest to the upside at\nthis price level.\n",

      "text": "Fig 6.12 Hammer Candles And Volume\nThis raises another point which I feel I should also mention here.\nVPA not only helps us get INTO low risk trading positions, it also helps to KEEP us in those positions, which is\noften one of the hardest things to do in trading. Holding a position and staying in a trend can be very difficult,\nand I believe is one of the hardest skills to master. It is also a primary reason why so many traders fail. After all,\nit is staying in a trend where we maximise any profit, and a trend can be from a few minutes or hours, to several\ndays and weeks.\nWe all know as traders, that the market only goes up in steps and down in steps, never in a straight line, and we\nhave to stay in positions through these minor pull backs and reversals. This is one of the many great powers of\nVPA as it will help to keep you in an existing position, and give you the confidence using your own analysis, to\ntruly see inside the market.\nFor example, the market may be moving lower, we are short the market, and we see a hammer formed. Is this a\nreversal in trend and time to exit, or merely a short term reversal in a longer term trend lower? If the volume is\nlow, then clearly the insiders are not buying at this level. Perhaps the hammer is followed by a shooting star on\naverage to high volume, a sign of weakness in the down trend, and confirming the analysis of the hammer\ncandle. The market is weak and our analysis using VPA has given us the confidence to hold the position in the\nmarket through this pullback. Without volume, we would have little idea of the strength or weakness of this price\nactivity. With volume, it is all revealed, and we can base our decisions accordingly.\nThis is the power of VPA. Not only does it get us into trades, but it helps keep us in, and finally gets us out.\nTaking the above example again in Fig 6.12, and the hammer which arrives with high or ultra high volume. This\nis an early warning signal of a potential reversal. The big money is moving in, and as a short seller it is\npotentially time to exit the market, take some or all of our profits off the table, and prepare for a long position\n",

      "text": "when the break out occurs.\nGetting into a trade is the easy part, staying in and then getting out at the right time is very difficult. And this is\nwhere VPA is such a powerful technique in giving us the insight we need into market behaviour. Once you\nbegin to interpret and understand what the price and volume relationship is signalling, then you have arrived at\ntrading Nirvana.\nNow finally, if we do see the hammer candle at the top of a bullish trend, it has a different name, and a\ncompletely different interpretation. This will be covered later in this chapter when we consider other candles\nand candle patterns, as we continue to build on our knowledge.\nThis is what I meant by Principle 4 – a candle can have a very different meaning depending on where it\nappears in the overall trend. At the top of a trend the hammer is called a ‘hanging man’ and when it appears in a\ncandle pattern with a shooting star is signalling weakness.\nThe final candle in our trio of premier candles is the doji, but not just any doji candle, it is the long legged doji.\nThe Long Legged Doji Candle\nPrice action – indecision\nThere are many variants of the doji candle, and you will see them continuously in every chart. They are all\ncharacterised in the same way with the open and close being the same or very close, and with a wick to the\nupper and lower body.\nThis is the price action which creates the unique pattern of the doji candle, or doji cross. Whilst there are many\ndifferent sizes and types of doji candle, there is only ONE which I believe is significant in the context of VPA,\nand that is the long legged doji.\nIn itself the doji candle signifies indecision. The market is reaching a point at which bullish and bearish\nsentiment is equally balanced. In the context of what actually take place in the session, it is something like this.\nThe market opens, and sentiment takes the price action in one direction. This is promptly reversed and taken in\nthe opposite direction, before the opening market sentiment regains control and brings the market back to the\nopening price once more. In other words, there have been some wild swings in price action within the session,\nbut the fulcrum of price has remained in the middle.\nThe key point about this type of doji candle, is that both the upper and lower wicks are long in comparison to the\nbody, and should resemble what I used to call, a 'daddy long legs' – a small flying insect with very long legs!\nThe power of the candle lies in it's predictive power as a potential signal of a reversal in trend. Just like the\nhammer and the shooting star, the price action alone gives us a firm signal, but when combined with volume, it\nbecomes immensely powerful. The price action in the candle is sufficient, in itself, to tell us visually that there is\nindecision. After all, if this were not the case, then the candle would be very different in construction.\nOnce again, the price action reveals the sentiment, which in this case is indecision and therefore a possible\nreversal. The long legged doji can signal a reversal from bearish to bullish, or bullish to bearish, and the\nchange in direction depends on the preceding price action. If we have been in an up trend for some time, and\nthe long legged doji appears, then this may be the first sign of a reversal in trend to bearish. Conversely, if we\nsee this candle after the market has been falling for some time, then this may be signalling a reversal to bullish.\nHowever, unlike the shooting star and the hammer candle, with the long legged doji candle we CAN have an\nanomaly in volume. Once again as we can see in Fig 6.13 I have shown the candle with three volume bars\nbeneath, and the one which is an anomaly is the first one on low volume.\nLet me explain why this is an anomaly, and also introduce another concept here which fits neatly into this\nsection.\n",

      "text": "Fig 6.13 The Long Legged Doji\nWhy is low volume on such a candle an anomaly? Well, let's think about this logically. The market has moved\nsharply in both directions and finally closed back or near the opening price. This price action is a sign of\nvolatility in the market, as the market has swung back and forth in the session. If the market were not volatile,\nthen we would see a very different type of candle. Therefore, if the market is volatile, why is there low volume.\nVolatile markets require effort and as we know effort and result go hand in hand. However, in this instance we\nhave no effort (low volume) and a big result (wide price action). Clearly this is an anomaly, and the only logical\nanswer is that the price is being moved by the insiders, who are simply not joining in at the moment. The most\ncommon reason for this is stop hunting, where the market makers and insiders are moving prices violently, first\none way and then the other, to shake traders out, and to take out stop and limit orders in the process. They are\nnot buying or selling themselves, but simply 'racking' the price around, generally using a news release as the\ncatalyst, and this brings me to an important point in the VPA story.\nThe long legged doji is seen most often during a fundamental news release, and the classic one for the US\nmarkets is the monthly Non Farm Payroll data, released on the first Friday of every month. On the release, price\nbehaviour becomes extremely volatile, where this candle is created repeatedly when economic data such as\nthis is released. The market swings violently one way, then the other, and then perhaps back again. It is the\nideal opportunity for the insiders to whipsaw traders in and out of positions fast, taking out stops and other\norders in the market at the same time.\nAnd the reason we know this is happening is volume, or rather the lack of it. If the volume is low, then this is\nNOT a genuine move, but an ANOMALY. For the price to behave in this way takes effort, and we are seeing this\nwith no effort, as shown with low volume. The insiders are simply manipulating prices, and in this case, the long\nlegged doji is NOT signalling a reversal, but something very different. Insider manipulation on a grand scale at\nthis price level. It may well be that the market does reverse later, but at this stage, we stay out, and wait for\n",

      "text": "further candles to unfold.\nThe next point which leads on from this is the interaction between volume and the news. Whenever we have an\neconomic release, a statement, a rate decision, or any other item of fundamental news, then the associated\nvolume reaction will instantly tell us whether the market is validating the news or ignoring it. In other words, here\ntoo volume validates the news release, and tells us immediately whether the market insiders are joining in any\nsubsequent price action or waiting on the sidelines and staying out.\nIf the insiders are joining in, then we can too, and if not, then we stay out, just like them.\nFor example, when a 'big number' is released, say NFP, which is seen as positive for risk assets such as\nequities, commodities and risk currencies, and perhaps we are trading a currency. Then we should see these\nassets rise strongly on the news, supported by strong and rising volume. If this is the case, then we know the\nmarkets have validated the news and the insiders and big money are joining in. We might see a wide spread up\ncandle, with high volume. The news has been validated and confirmed by the price action and associated\nvolume.\nI would urge you to study volume whenever news is released, as it is one of the quickest ways to learn the\nbasics of VPA. Here you will see it at work. Surges in volume accompanying large price moves, large price\nmoves on low volume, and trap moves, such as low volume on a long legged doji. It will all be there for you.\nHowever, the key point is this. When news is released, it is often the first place where we see volume surges in\nthe market, and they are excellent places to start our analysis. If the volume surge has validated the price move,\nthen we can be sure that the insiders are joining in the move higher or lower. If the price action has moved on\nthe news, but has NOT been validated by supportive volumes, then it is an anomaly and other forces are at\nwork. This is telling us to be cautious.\nVolume and the news should go hand in hand. After all, the markets generally react to the major news releases\nwhich occur throughout the trading day, and this is the easiest, quickest and simplest way, to begin to read the\nmarket, and also gain a perspective on what is low, medium, high or ultra high volume, for all the various\ninstruments and markets you may be trading.\nA long legged doji candle, should always be validated by a minimum of average volume, and preferably high or\nultra high. If it is low, then it is an anomaly and therefore a trap set by the insiders.\nThose then are our trio of 'premier candles' that we watch for in all time frames. They are our cue to pay\nattention and start our VPA analysis. If we are not in a position, we are looking for confirmation of an entry, and\nif we are already in the market, we are looking for signals either to stay in, or exit.\nNow let's move on to some of the other key individual candles, and then on to consider some candle patterns.\nWide Spread Candles\n",

      "text": "Fig 6.14 Wide Spread Candle\nPrice action – strong market sentiment\nThe price action of the wide spread candle is sending a clear signal with only ONE message. Sentiment for the\nsession is strong. It is either strongly bullish or strongly bearish, but the word is STRONG. The price action has\nrisen sharply higher or lower in the session and closed at or near the high of an up candle, or at or near the low\nof a down candle. The associated volume should therefore reflect this strong sentiment with 'strong' volume.\nAs we can see in the example in Fig 6.14, if the volume is above average, then this is what we should expect to\nsee as it validates the price. The insiders are joining the move higher and everything is as it should be.\nIf the volume is below average or low, this is a warning signal. The price is being marked higher, but with little\neffort. The warning bells are now ringing. Many retail traders will be rushing to join the move higher or lower\nthinking this is a valid move by the market. But the volume reveals a very different story. If we are in a position,\nwe look to exit. If we are not in a position we stay out, and wait for the next signal to see when and where the\ninsiders are now taking this market.\nNarrow Spread Candles\nPrice action – weak market sentiment\nYou may be wondering why we should be interested in a narrow spread candle, which tells us when market\nsentiment is weak. After all, shouldn’t we simply be interested when the insiders are in the market, to which the\nanswer is, yes, of course. Narrow spread candles can be found everywhere and in quantity. But the reason we\nneed to consider them is that, in general markets move higher slowly. Markets pause, consolidate and reverse,\noften on narrow spread candles. Therefore, the interesting ones are NOT those validated by volume, but the\nanomalies.\n",

These are of little interest to us.\nHowever, the ones that are of great interest are the anomalies, where we see above average, or high volume,\non a narrow spread candle. This should instantly alert us, and we should ask ourselves why.\nThe reason is very simple and can be seen in Fig 6.15. If we have an up candle with a narrow spread and\nrelatively high volume, then the market is showing some signs of weakness. As we know high volume should\nresult in a wide spread candle, not a narrow spread. Effort vs result again. The insiders are starting to struggle\nat this price level. The market is resistant to higher prices, and although it has moved a little way higher, is now\nproving resistant to any further progress, and the next candle could be a shooting star, which would then\nconfirm this weakness further.\nEqually, if we see high volume on a down candle then the reverse applies. Here the insiders are starting to see\nsigns of bullish sentiment enter the market. The price is narrow, with buyers ( insiders) coming in, and\nsupporting the market at this level. Again, this is the first sign of a potential reversal from bearish to bullish.\nSubsequent candles may confirm this and we would now be waiting for a hammer, or possibly a long legged\ndoji to add further weight to the analysis.\nThe Hanging Man Candle\nPrice action – potential weakness after bullish trend\nWhen I first started using VPA and candles, I always used to assume that a hanging man appearing in a bullish\ntrend was a sign of strength, and continuation of the trend, since to me this was the same action as the hammer\ncandle. It isn't. It is in fact the opposite, and is a sign of weakness, provided it is associated with above average\nvolume as shown in Fig 6.16.\n",

      "text": "Fig 6.16 Hanging Man\nAnd the question is, why is it a sign of weakness? The answer is very simple. The market has been rising\nsteadily on rising volume, when at some point in the bullish trend, the market sells off sharply, with the price\nmoving lower in the session, only to recover and close at, or near the high of the session, creating the familiar\n'hammer candle price action'. Except here we now refer to this candle as the hanging man candle, as it is now\nat the top of a bullish trend.\nThe reason this candle is considered to be bearish is that this is the first sign of selling pressure in the market.\nThe insiders have been tested, and the buyers have supported the market, but this candle is sending a signal\nthat the market is moving towards an over sold area. The body of the candle can be either red or blue, but the\nprice needs to close at, or near the open.\nThe price action is confirming the appearance of sustained selling pressure, which on this occasion has been\nsupported by the buyers, but it is an early warning of a possible change. It is an early warning signal, and now\nwe need to watch our charts for confirming signals.\nThe insiders will have seen this weakness appearing too, and be starting to plan their next move.\nThe hanging man is validated if it is followed by the appearance of a shooting star in the next few candles,\nparticularly if associated with above average or high volume. The key here is validation. On its own it is not a\nstrong signal, but merely gives us early warning of a possible change.\nFor this candle to be validated and confirmed we need to see further signs of weakness at this level, or close to\nthis level, which would then increase the significance of the candle. For example, a hanging man, immediately\nfollowed by a shooting star is an excellent combination and adds considerably to the strength of the initial\nsignal. Even if the shooting star appears later in the candle sequence, this is still a strong confirming signal,\nprovided it is associated with high volume.\n",

As I have said many times before, the market is like an oil tanker. It never reverses on a dime\nfor many reasons, not least because just like a supertanker it has momentum, and therefore takes time to\nrespond, once the brakes are applied.\nFig 6.17 Stopping Volume\nIn Fig 6.17 we are in a strong down trend, the price waterfall has been in action and the market has been\nmoving lower fast. However, the insiders now want to start slowing the rate of descent, so start to move in and\nbegin the buying process. This buying is then seen in subsequent candles with deep lower wicks, but generally\nwith relatively deep bodies. However, for additional strength in the signal, the close of the candle should be in\nthe upper half of the open and close price. This is not a hard and fast rule, but generally describes the candles\nas shown in Fig 6.17.\nWhat is happening, is that the weight of the selling pressure has become so great at this point, that even the\ninsiders moving into the market have insufficient muscle to stop the market falling in one session. It takes two or\nthree sessions for the brakes to be applied and is like our tanker. Switch off the engines and the ship will\ncontinue for several miles.

Next, we see another candle with a narrower body and a deep wick. Finally, we see our first\nhammer candle.\nThe sequence of candles in Fig 6.17 is an almost perfect example, and if we do see this combination following\na sharp move lower, then we would be on full alert for the forthcoming move higher.\nStopping volume is exactly that. It is the volume of the insiders and professional money coming into the market\nand stopping it falling further. It is a great signal of impending strength, and a potential reversal in the bearish\ntrend to a bullish trend. It is the precursor to the buying climax which should follow as the last remnants of\nselling pressure are mopped up, the warehouses are filled to over flowing, and the insiders are ready to go. You\nshould be to!!\nTopping Out Volume\nPrice action - weakness\nThe clue is in the name! Just as stopping volume was stopping the market from falling further, so topping out\nvolume is the market topping out after a bullish run higher.\nOnce again, the market does not simply stop and reverse, it has momentum, both in up trends and in down\ntrends. The down trend pressure is certainly more intense as the market is generally moving faster.\nNevertheless, in an up trend we still have momentum generated by the insiders driving demand. Traders and\ninvestors are jumping into the market, driven by greed and fear of missing out on easy profits. The volumes are\nhigh and rising, and the insiders are now selling into this demand, driving the market higher into this selling\npressure, which is building. This is the price action we are seeing reflected in the deep upper wicks to each\nsubsequent candle.\nAt this point it is becoming increasingly difficult for the insiders to keep the market momentum going, as they\ncontinue to sell at this level, with the candles creating the ‘arcing pattern’ as the spreads narrow and the price\nrise slows. Volumes are well above average and probably high or ultra high.\n",

      "text": "Chapter Seven\nSupport And Resistance Explained\nMoney and markets may never forget, but surely people do. And that will not be different this time, next time, or\nany time in your life.\nKenneth L Fisher (1950-)\nSo far in this book on Volume Price Analysis we have focused on the 'pure' relationship between volume and\nprice.\nIn this chapter I am going to introduce the first of our analytical techniques, which helps to give us our\n'perspective' on where we are in terms of the price behaviour on the chart. More importantly, when combined\nwith VPA, this technique also reveals when trends are about to start or end, and equally when markets are\nmoving into congestion phases.\nTo use a building analogy for a moment. If volume and price can be considered the foundations, then the\nanalytical techniques I explain in the next few chapters are the walls, floors, ceilings and the roof. In other\nwords, they provide the framework for volume and price. VPA on it's own is extremely powerful. However, what\nthese additional techniques will add are the markers, the signposts if you like, as to where the market is in its\nlonger term journey on the chart.\nPerhaps one of the most difficult aspects of trading is managing and exiting any position. As I said earlier,\ngetting in is the easy part, getting out is hard, and this is where these techniques will help in 'mapping' the price\naction. They are milestones if you like, and understanding these milestones and the messages they convey will\nthen help you to understand not only when a market is about to trend, but also, and perhaps more importantly,\nwhen it is coming to an end.\nLet me begin with the first of these techniques which is known as support and resistance. Once again, this is a\npowerful concept which can be applied to any market, any instrument and in any time frame, so whether you are\nusing VPA as a scalping intra day trader, or as a longer term investor, support and resistance is one of the key\nprinciples of price behaviour on a chart.\nHowever, the irony of support and resistance is that it is in sharp contrast to VPA itself. Volume Price Analysis\nfocuses on the 'leading' aspects of price behaviour and tries to analyse where the market is heading next.\nSupport and resistance does this in a different way entirely, by focusing on what has gone before. The history of\nprice behaviour, the 'lagging' aspects of price behaviour.\nDespite this irony, it is the combination of the two which gives us a perspective on where the market is in terms\nof its overall journey. It tells us where the market might pause, breakout, or reverse, both now and in the future,\nall important markers for the entry, management and exit of trading positions.\nTherefore, let me recap the basics of price behaviour. In broad terms a market can only move in one of three\nways, up, down or sideways. In other words, a market can only trend higher, trend lower or move sideways in a\nconsolidating phase of price action. Of these three states, markets spend considerably more time moving\nsideways, than they do trending either higher or lower. As a rough rule of thumb this is generally considered to\nbe around 70% of the time, whilst only trending for 30% of the time. Markets move sideways for all sorts of\nreasons, but primarily there are three.\nFirst, is the pending release of an item of fundamental news. To see this in action simply watch the price action\nahead of the monthly Non Farm Payroll for example. Prices are likely to trade in a narrow range for several\nhours ahead of this key release.\nSecond, markets move sideways in both the selling climax and the buying climax phases, when warehouses\nare either being filled or emptied by the insiders.\nThird and finally, markets move sideways when they run into old areas of price, where traders have been\nlocked into weak positions in previous moves. As the market approaches these areas, speculators and\ninvestors grab the chance to exit the market, usually grateful to be able to close out with a small loss.\n",

This price behaviour\nappears on all charts, with clearly defined areas where the market has moved sideways for an extended period.\nSupport And Resistance\nFig 7.10 Support & Resistance\nThe analogy that I always use to explain this type of price action is that of a house, with floors and ceilings,\nwhich I hope will help to fix this more vividly in your mind's eye. What is happening in the schematic in Fig\n7.10?\nTo begin with the price has fallen, before reversing higher, only to fall back again, before reversing higher\nagain. This zig zag price action is repeated over and over again, and as a result, has created the 'channel' of\nprice action with peaks and troughs as shown on the schematic. This oscillating price action creates what we\ncall the floor of support and the ceiling of resistance. Each time the price action comes down to the floor, it is\nsupported by what appears to be an invisible cushion. Not only does this help to prevent the market from falling\nfurther, but also helps the price to bounce higher.\nOnce the price has bounced off the floor of support, it heads back towards the ceiling of resistance, where an\ninvisible barrier appears again, this time preventing the price moving higher and pushing it back lower again.\nFor any of you who remember the very first computer games such as ping pong with the two paddles, it is very\nsimilar, with the ball, or the market in this case, bouncing endlessly back and forth between the two price levels.\nAt some point the price will break out from this region.\nHowever, before moving on there are several points I would like to examine and the first, and perhaps most\nobvious is, why is this price action so important.

What is actually happening in this scenario?\nFirst the market has moved higher, buyers are still buying into the trend, but then the price reverses, and moves\nlower. The buyers are trapped at this higher level, and are now regretting their decision. They are trapped in a\nweak position. The market moves lower, but then starts to move higher again, as buyers come in at this lower\nlevel, fearful they may miss out on another leg higher in the trend. As the market approaches the first reversal\npoint, those buyers in a weak position, sell, glad to exit with a small loss or at break-even. This selling pressure\nsends the market lower, away from the ceiling level, but with a second wave of buyers now trapped in weak\npositions at this higher level.\nThe market then approaches the floor again, where buyers enter, seeing an opportunity to join the bullish trend,\nand take the market back to the ceiling again, where the second wave of weak traders sell out, and exit with\neither a small loss or marginal profits. This oscillating price action is then repeated.\nAt the top of each wave, buyers are left in weak positions, and then sell out on the next wave, to be replaced by\nmore buyers at the top of the wave, who then sell out at the top of the subsequent wave. It is this constant\nbuying and then selling at similar price levels, which creates the 'invisible' bands, which are made visible by\njoining the highs and lows on the price chart.\nThe buyers who bought at the floor of the price action, are happy to hold on, expecting higher prices. They have\nbought at the lower level as the market has pulled back, seen the market rise, and then reverse back to the\noriginal entry level. Unlike those buyers who bought at the ceiling level, their positions have never been in loss.\nSo far, all that has happened, is that a potential profit has been reduced back to zero, or close to zero, so these\nbuyers are still hopeful of making a profit from their position. Fear is not yet driving their decision making.\nIn fact, there is nothing magical about these price levels of the floor and the ceiling. They simply represent the\n'extreme' psychological levels of fear and greed in that particular price region and time. We must always\nremember, price action is fuelled by these two basic emotions, and it is in the price congestion phase of market\nbehaviour, that we see these emotions in their most basic form. At the top of the first wave, greed is the over\nriding emotion. By the time the market returns on the second wave, fear and relief are the over riding emotion for\nthese traders.\nFear And Greed Riding The Wave – Top Of Bull Trend\n",

The over riding emotion as the market hits the top of the first wave is greed, combined with\nthe emotion of fear – the fear of missing out on a good trading opportunity. Remember, these traders are weak\nanyway. Why? Because they have been waiting and waiting, watching the market continue higher, frightened to\nget in, as they are nervous and emotional traders, but at the same time, frightened of missing a 'golden\nopportunity' to make some money. After all they have seen the market rise and are now wishing they had\nentered earlier. They eventually buy at the top of the first wave.\nThe market then promptly reverses, and they immediately become fearful of a loss. The market moves lower\nthen bounces. At the bottom of the first wave, buyers come in, entering on the pull back and pleased to be\ngetting into the market at a 'good price'. The market moves back higher towards the top of the first wave.\nThe buyers at this level cannot wait to exit, as the fear drains away and they get out with a small loss.\nRemember, throughout this phase of price action, they have NEVER seen a profit, only an increasing loss,\nwhich has then reduced back to close to zero. Their emotional level of fear, a fear indicator if we had one, would\nhave been rising steadily on the downwards leg, and then falling on the upwards leg, but at no time was their\nposition in any sort of 'potential profit' so this group is simply pleased to exit with just a small loss.\nAfter all, at one point the potential loss could have been much worse, so this group considers it has done well in\nclosing with just a small loss. Remember also, that this group always trades on emotion anyway, so is almost\nalways in a weak position when they open any trade, and therefore very easy to manipulate using emotional\nprice swings.\n",

They have\nbeen prepared to wait, and buy on a pullback in price, they are not chasing the market, and are prepared to be\npatient. In general, they are more experienced.\nAs the market moves higher to the top of the third wave, their position has a potential profit, before it reverses\nlower, back to the level at which they entered the market. However, at no point during this journey have they\nsuffered the emotion of a potential loss. They may be regretting the decision not to close at the top of the wave,\nbut are likely to continue to hold on the expectation of a bounce back higher.\nTheir emotional response is therefore very different. Unlike the weak group at the top of each wave, this group\nhas less emotional stress pressure to deal with on each wave. All they have to deal with is the emotional\npressure of seeing a potential profit drain away, not the emotional pressure of recovering from a potential loss.\nThe buyers at the top of each wave can be considered to be weak, but the buyers at the bottom of each wave\ncan be considered to be strong. Naturally I accept this is a very simplistic way of looking at market price action\nin these regions, nevertheless it is typical of what happens when markets consolidate.\nIt is this constant flow of buyers and sellers entering the market in these contained areas, that creates the\ninvisible barriers of price, which then become barriers and platforms in the future, since within these price\nregions we have dense populations of buyers and sellers, both weak and strong.\nSo do we see the same at the bottom of a trend lower?

      "text": "The principles here are exactly the same as for the bullish trend that we looked at earlier. As we can in our\nschematic in Fig 7.12 the market has been in a down trend for some time, and once again, the weak emotional\ntraders are drawn into the market, just as it is about to reverse. They have seen other traders making nice profits\nfrom the move lower, and finally overcome their fear of trading, and make an emotional decision to join the\nmarket.\nThe market immediately reverses against them and bounces higher locking them instantly into a losing position,\nwhich then worsens. Fear mounts as the losses increase.\nFinally the market reverses back to where they first entered their position, and they exit, relieved to have been\nable to close out with just a small loss.\nThe strong traders are selling into the market at the tops of the waves, and their positions are generally positive\nthroughout as the market moves back and forth in the trading range.\nOnce again, the price consolidation creates the invisible barriers which are then densely populated with both\nweak and strong groups of traders, and which then become platforms either of support or resistance during\nfuture market activity.\nI hope the above explanation has at least given you an insight into why these levels are important. What this\nconstant price action creates is invisible barriers and platforms all over our charts, which we then 'see' by\njoining up the price action at the top and bottom of each wave with horizontal lines. These give us the visual\nperspective on where these regions are on the charts. Each time future price action approaches these regions,\nbecause of the dense population of buyers and sellers marooned in these zones, we can expect the market to\nat least pause and 'test' these areas in the manner I will be covering shortly.\nOf equal importance is when the market pauses in one of these areas, but then continues on its journey in the\nsame direction as the original trend. Both of these have important consequences and send us key signals, all\nvalidated with volume, which we will look at shortly. But first, let me set out some general principles when using\nthis analytical technique.\nFirst Principle\nThe lines we draw on our charts to define the ceiling and the floor of these price regions are NOT rods of steel.\nConsider them more as rubber, flexible bands. Remember, technical analysis and VPA is an art, and NOT a\nscience. Whilst these levels do constitute barriers and platforms, they are not solid walls, and on occasion you\nwill see them broken, only for the market to then move back into the channel once again. Consider them to be\n'elastic' with a little bit of 'give'.\nSecond Principle\nAlways remember Wyckoff's second law, the law of cause and effect. If the cause is large, then this will be\nreflected in the effect, which applies to support and resistance. The longer a market consolidates in a narrow\nrange, then the more dramatic the resulting price action once the market moves away from this region. Naturally\nthis is all relative, not least because a market that has been consolidating on a daily chart for several weeks is\nlikely to trend for a similar period, whilst any breakout from a consolidation phase on a 5 minute chart may only\nbe for an hour or so – it is all relative.\nThird Principle\nThe third principle is perhaps the one which perplexes most new traders and it is this – how do I know when the\nmarket is in congestion? After all, it's easy to look back in hindsight and see where the price action has been\nconsolidating for some time, but when the market action is live, it is only 'after the event' that any consolidation\nphase becomes self evident.\nThis is where the concept of an isolated pivot high and an isolated pivot low become key signals, and whilst\nthere are indicators available to create these automatically, they are simple to spot visually.\nIsolated Pivots\n",

And the easiest way to understand pivots is\nto suppose the market is moving higher in an up trend, and we see an isolated pivot high formed on the chart.\nWe have now seen the first sign of possible weakness in the market. These pivots are created by a three\nbar/candle reversal and as shown in Fig 7.13 above. To qualify as a three bar/candle reversal the candle in the\ncentre has to post a higher high and a higher low, creating the pivot high pattern. The appearance of one pivot\ndoes not mean we are moving into a congestion phase at this point. All we can say at this stage is that we have\na possible short term reversal in prospect.\nNow we are waiting for our equivalent isolated pivot low to be created. This occurs when we have a three\nbar/candle pattern where the centre candle has a lower low and a lower high than those on either side. Again\nwe have an example in Fig 7.13.\nOnce this candle pattern appears on our chart, we can now draw the first two lines to define the ceiling and the\nfloor of our congestion zone. The pivot high is the ceiling and the pivot low is the floor. These simple candle\npatterns not only define the start of any congestion phase, they also define the upper and lower levels as the\nmarket moves into a period of sideways price action.

What happens next?\nAt some point of course, the market finally breaks out from these regions, and this is the trigger that we have\nbeen waiting for, either to confirm the continuation of a current trend, or to signal a reversal.\nHowever, throughout the price congestion phase we are constantly looking for clues and signals using our VPA\nknowledge to confirm weakness or strength as the market moves sideways. Moreover, if the congestion phase\nhas been created as a result of a buying or selling climax, then the signals will be very clear.\nBut, the signal we are constantly watching for now, once we are in a congestion phase, is the volume\nassociated with any breakout and consequent strong move away from this region. As we have already seen,\ncongestion areas, are densely populated areas, with traders locked in a variety of weak positions, and therefore\nany break away from these areas requires volume, and generally lots of it. A break out from such a price area\non low volume, is a classic trap move by the insiders, and is often referred to as a 'fake out'.\nThe insiders are trying to trap traders on the wrong side of the market once again, and a break out from recent\ncongestion is another classic strategy. Only VPA traders will be aware of such a false move, since the volume\nassociated with any move higher or lower will be clearly visible. This is why these price regions are so\nimportant and they are important for three reasons :\nFirst, if we have a current position in the market, and we see a breakout validated in our direction, then this is a\nVERY clear signal of a continuation of the move, and therefore gives us confidence to hold the position.\n",

But\nthere needs to be a 'clearly visible' gap in terms of the closing price of the candle which finally breaches the\nceiling level. This is the first signal that a breakout is in progress. The second is volume.\nAs we can see in Fig 7.16 the initial move higher up and through the ceiling level, has to be accompanied by\nstrong and rising volume. It takes effort for the market to move away, rather like dragging someone out of\nquicksand or a bog. The same applies here, and you should see this reflected in the associated volume of the\nnext few bars. If you DON'T see this, then you know it is either a trap up move by the insiders, or there is simply\nno interest from market participants to take the market higher at this stage.\nIf it is a valid move, then the volumes on the initial break will be well above average and rising, as the market\nfinally throws off the shackles and starts to build a trend. At this stage, do not be surprised to see the market pull\nback to test the ceiling as it moves higher, but this should be accompanied with low or falling volume, since we\nare now developing a bullish trend higher and expect to see a rising market with rising volume, if this is a true\nmove higher. Once clear, VPA then takes over and we are back to a candle by candle analysis of the price\naction as the trend unfolds.\nExactly the same principles apply when the breakout is into a bearish trend (See Fig 7.17).

The\nonly difference is that this time we are breaking through the floor of price congestion, and not the ceiling.\nAs before, this breakout should be clean and well developed, and accompanied by well above average volume\nto reflect the effort required to break away. Again, do not be surprised to see the market move back higher to test\nthe floor area, but this should be on low volume, and as the market pulls away rising volume should reflect the\ndownwards move.

The so called breakout trades.\nSecond, and perhaps just as important, the reason that this trading approach is so popular is that it embraces in\nits strategy, the whole concept of support and resistance which is this – that in creating these regions, and using\nthem as part of the trading strategy, you are in effect, using the markets own price behaviour to provide you with\nprotection on your positions. By this I mean that in trading using a breakout, the market has put in place its own\nnatural barriers to protect you against any sudden changes in market direction as the trend develops.\nReturning to the price action in our ‘house’. As we approach the ceiling of the first floor we move into price\ncongestion, pause, and then break through into the first floor room above. We now have a 'natural floor' of price\nsupport in place, which is giving us protection in the event that the market pauses and perhaps moves back to\ntest the price in this area. This floor is our natural protection, defined by the market for us. After all, we know\nfrom our VPA studies that to move back and through this area would take effort and volume, so we therefore\nhave a natural area of support now working in our favour. Not only does the floor offer us protection should the\nmarket pull back, it also offers the market support to the continued move higher.\nIt is a WIN/WIN. You have the comfort of knowing that once the market has broken through a ceiling of price\nresistance, not only does this become a floor of price support, it has also become a barrier of price protection in\nthe event of any short term re-test of this area. Any stop loss for example could then be placed in the lower\nregions of the price congestion. This is why breakout trading is so popular, and when backed with VPA\nvalidation becomes even more powerful.\nThe same principles apply when markets are moving lower. In our ‘house’ example we were in an up trend, but\nif we take the down trend example, then this works in identical fashion.\nPicking up the price action where the market has reversed at the roof level, we are approaching the second\nfloor, floor level. The market moves into congestion and then breaks through the ceiling of the first floor room\nbelow. What was the floor of price support has now become the ceiling of price resistance, and once again\noffers two things. Price resistance to any short term reversal, adding pressure to any downwards move lower,\nand secondly, a natural barrier of price protection in the event of any short term pullback.\nOnce again, it is a WIN/WIN situation for the breakout trader, this time to the short side of the market.\nThis is using this concept in taking trading positions as the market action develops, but its power also lies in the\nprice action and history that the market leaves behind. The market leaves its own DNA, buried in the charts.\nThese areas of price congestion remain on the charts forever. The price moves on, but these areas remain, and\nat some point in the future, price behaviour moves back into these regions, and at this stage these areas, often\ndormant for long periods, then become powerful once again, and begs the question as to whether the market\nhas a memory.\nOr is it because, as traders we are all looking at the same charts, and therefore these areas of price become self\nfulfilling prophecies? Perhaps it’s because these areas are densely populated with weak traders, still holding\non and waiting for a reversal so they can exit with small losses or small profits?\nIt may well be a combination of all of these. Whatever the reasons these areas can and do play a significant role\nin price behaviour as they are visited by the market repeatedly. Once again, where there are extensive areas of\ncongestion, then the more significant will be their impact.\nLet's go back to our house schematic again, and in particular the failure to break the ceiling of resistance on the\n",

The reason for this failure on the price chart, may well have been as a result of sustained areas of\nold price congestion in the same region, and failures at this level in the past. If the market has failed at this level\npreviously, which as a trader you will see on your price chart with areas of price congestion on the longer time\nframes, then there is every chance that it will fail at this level again. After all, there was a reason. This could\nhave been a selling climax, occurring years previously and what was once considered overbought at this level\nis now considered fair value.\nNevertheless, as traders, this is a key level, and volume will give us all the clues we need to validate the\nsubsequent price action. If this is in fact an old area of price congestion, at which level the market failed and\nreversed previously, then if it does succeed in breaching the ceiling on this occasion, then this adds greater\nsignificance to the move higher, and a strong platform of support would then be in place. Equally a failure would\nsuggest an extremely weak market, and something we will look at when considering key price patterns.\nThis is the power of support and resistance. It is the market signalling all those areas of price congestion which\ncome into play constantly. They are the DNA of the market. Its history and life story rolled into one, and as you\nwould expect works exactly the same way regardless of whether markets are falling or rising. In this example\nthe market reversed from resistance, but equally powerful is the concept of old support regions when a market is\nfalling. These areas then provide natural platforms of support, to stop any further decline in the market, and just\nas in a rising market, if these areas are deep and wide, then they take on increased significance, which is\nfurther enhanced if there has been any major reversal at this level in the past.\nNaturally, price congestion areas come in all shapes and sizes, and in all time frames. A stock index may trade\nin a narrow range for days or even weeks. A currency pair may move sideways for months. Bonds often trade in\nvery narrow ranges, particularly in the current financial crisis. Stocks may remain waterlogged for months.\nConversely, areas of price congestion may last for a few minutes or a few hours. The underlying concepts\nremain the same, because as VPA traders all we have to remember is that cause and effect go hand in hand.\nAn area of price congestion on a 5 minute chart will still offer support and resistance to the intra day trader,\nalong with any breakout trading opportunities, but in the context of the longer term will have little effect.\nHowever, move to the same instrument on the daily chart, and if we see a deep area of price congestion, then\nany move through the ceiling or floor will be significant.\nThis is yet another reason for trading using multiple charts and time frames. Price congestion on a 5 minute\nchart will have less significance than on a 15 minute, than an hourly chart. In other words the longer the time\nframe then the greater the significance, all other things being equal.\nSupport and resistance is a powerful concept in its own right. Match it with VPA, and it will become another of\nthe cornerstones of your trading methodology, based on volume and price.\n",

      "text": "Chapter Eight\nDynamic Trends And Trend Lines\nThe loss was not bad luck. It was bad analysis.\nDavid Einhorn (1968-)\nIn this chapter I want to explore the concept of trends and trend lines. And no doubt you will have heard the oft\nquoted term 'let the trend be your friend', which in my humble opinion is more or less meaningless mumbo\njumbo.\nIt is the one mantra that people who profess to be mentors and coaches parrot to their students in an effort to\nimpress. However, just like price congestion where, with hindsight any fool can see when the market has been\ntrading sideways, so it is with trends. And anyone who quotes this axiom has clearly little, live trading\nexperience, in my view. Generally they will show you a lovely trend with several lines on, and sagely advise\nthat this was the place to enter and then hold for the duration of the trend, before finally exiting at the end of the\ntrend run higher or lower. All easy stuff when you are considering an historic chart.\nLet me start with some basic thoughts on trends, as I want to dispel some of the nonsense that has been written\non the subject. And the first, and most important question is this - how do we know when a trend has started?\nJust as with support and resistance, the short answer is that we won't, until it's over. It's that simple. It was the\nsame with our congestion phase. We have to have some parameters to give us the clues as to whether a trend\nis beginning to develop in whatever time frame we are considering. As a trader, it is pointless to look back over\nan extended period, draw some lines on the chart, and then decide that this is a trend. By then you will have\nmissed most, if not all of the trend, and are probably just getting in, when the insiders are getting out.\nThis is why VPA is so powerful. It validates the price action for us, and reveals where we are in the longer term\ntrend. After all, if we see a selling climax or a buying climax, then we KNOW that a new trend is about to begin.\nWe are in at the start, which is where we want to be, NOT at the end, which is where trend lines inevitably point\nto, particularly if you only rely on this technique. I must stress that I am not saying trend lines are not useful, they\nare, but only when used in the correct way which is what I am going to teach you in this chapter.\nLet's start with Charles Dow who really laid down the foundations of trend analysis. His core beliefs in this\naspect of price behaviour were founded on one simple principle which was this – that the trend in an index, was\nfar more revealing and valuable than the trend in an individual stock. His view was very simple. An individual\nstock could be influenced by any number of factors, from earnings reports, broker recommendations, and\nanalysts views, all of which would affect the price. An index, on the other hand, was far more representative of\nthe broader sentiment in the market and therefore far more likely to be of use in identifying market trends. One of\nhis many axioms, that have since been absorbed into modern day technical analysis, is the concept of\nsystematic and unsystematic market risks.\nSystematic risks affect all stocks in an index, whilst unsystematic risks may affect only one or a group of stocks\nin one particular market. Dow's own work centred around the creation of indices, which now form the\ncornerstones of the financial markets, with the S&P 500, the Dow Jones (DJIA), the Nasdaq (NQ100) and many\nmore around the world. In addition, the concept of an index has been adopted by virtually every other market\nand instrument and led to the creation of volatility indices, such as the VIX, sector indices for stocks, currency\nindices such as the Dollar Index (DXY) and commodity indices such as the CRB, with hundreds of others in\nbetween. In some markets, indices are now considered more attractive to trade than the underlying assets from\nwhich they are derived.\nAnother of Dow's guiding principles was the concept that trends were classified into three broad time related\nphases, which he referred to as primary, secondary and minor trends. Now in his world, of course, the ticker\ntape was still the main source of data, and for Charles Dow and the other iconic traders of his day and later, the\ntime frames were very different to those of today. A minor trend for example would be one lasting for 2 to 3 days,\nwhilst a secondary trend might be 2 to 3 weeks and a primary trend for 2 to 3 months. For our purposes, with\nelectronic charts, our time horizons are much shorter. For intra day traders, a minor trend might last 2 to 3 hours,\nwhilst a secondary trend may last 2 to 3 days and a primary trend 2 to 3 weeks. These are much more realistic,\n",

      "text": "and indeed for many markets, the days of extended trends which last for months or longer are almost a thing of\nthe past. The markets have changed beyond all recognition. High frequency trading, market manipulation and\nthe move to electronic trading have all seen to that.\nNevertheless, Dow's original and pioneering work gives us a hook on which to hang our hat. What is also\ninteresting is that in developing his ideas of trend, he also introduced the concept of the three stages of a trend\nas follows :\n \n1. The accumulation phase\n2. The technical trend following stage\n3. The distribution stage\nIf this sounds familiar, then it should because this is the cycle the insiders follow in the constant round of first\nfilling, and then emptying their warehouses, as developed and expanded by Richard Wyckoff. Charles Dow\nreferred to the insiders as the 'smart money' with the distribution phase of the trend where the 'smart money' is\ntaking its profits and heading for the sign marked 'Exit'.\nNow at this point we are going to diverge from standard trend analysis and look at it in slightly different terms,\nwhich I hope you will find marginally more useful when trading live, rather than the theoretical nonsense that\nappears in most books. The above introduction has given us the framework to move on, but at this stage most\ntrend analysis would then present you with the schematic in Fig 8.10\nFig 8.10 A Bullish Trend Higher – Surely Not!\nHere we have the traditional picture of a trend.

That is the theory, but unfortunately, by the time we have waited for our three higher\nhighs and higher lows, the trend is already reaching a climax. We have already been through the technical\ntrend following stage and we are about to buy, at the start of a distribution phase.\nBut how do we know this? Because most likely you have been reading too many text books written by people\nwho have never traded or invested in their lives. This is all theoretical and, as I said earlier, very easy to see in\nhindsight, and once the trend is this well developed, it is not of much use.\nWhat is the answer? And for this we need to return to support and resistance which holds the key, and which is\nwhy I covered it in such detail in the previous chapter.\nSupport and resistance is where trends are created, born and then propelled on their way. This is where trends\nreverse and change direction. This is where accumulation and distribution phases occur, along with selling and\nbuying climaxes. It is the most important area of price behaviour on any chart. These areas are like the\nspawning grounds at the head of a great river, to which the salmon ultimately return to spawn.\nThis is where we start to answer the question that ALL traders, investors and speculators have at the forefront of\ntheir minds at all times. Is this the start of a trend, and if so, what is the strength of the trend and how far is it\nlikely to run? These questions can only be answered by understanding support and resistance in the context of\nVolume Price Analysis.\nTo attempt to do so in any other way is doomed to failure, and drawing a few lines on a chart, is a pointless and\nmeaningless exercise. In my humble opinion. I do accept they may help to clarify the trend a little and may even\nbe of limited use once the trend has started, but in terms of getting you into a strong position, they are of no\nvalue whatsoever.\nHowever, let’s return to basics and revisit our congestion phase, where the market is moving sideways and\ncreating the floors and ceilings of price support. The market is preparing to breakout, and all we need to do as\ntraders, investors or speculators is to wait, be patient and then to validate the breakout using volume. How do\nwe know the extent of the trend at this stage? The short answer is we don't, but we do have several clues which\nwill allow us to make an educated guess at this stage.\nFirst, is the extent of the price congestion phase. Again we must recall Wyckoff's cause and effect as this will\ndictate whether we can expect to see a primary, a secondary trend or a minor trend develop. For an intraday\nscalper, the trend will almost certainly be a minor trend, but this may well sit within the context of a longer term\ntrend in a slower time frame. In this context our scalper would then be trading, with the dominant trend in a\nhigher time frame. In other words the minor trend being traded, is in the same direction as the longer term trend,\nwhich for an intra day trader may be the hourly chart.\nThis is one of the many reasons why trading using multiple charts is so powerful. It helps to frame the trend that\nwe are trading. However, there is nothing wrong with taking a trade against the dominant trend in whatever time\nframe that may be. For example, the dominant trend in a stock market may be bullish on the index, but there\nmay be a bearish opportunity in a stock. This is fine, as long as we recognise that we are trading against the\n'dominant trend'. This type of trading is often referred to as 'counter trend trading', and there are two points that\ndefine this type of position.\nFirst, it is a higher risk position as we are trading 'against the market flow' – swimming against the tide if you\nlike. Second, and following on from the first point, we are only likely to be holding such a position for a short\nperiod of time, since by definition we are trading against the longer term dominant trend.\nNext, in any congestion phase as VPA traders we are always analysing the volume from two standpoints. First\nthe volume associated with the sideways price action to determine whether this is a major reversal evidenced\nby volume, as either a selling or a buying climax. Secondly, the volume and price action following any\n",

      "text": "associated breakout, which will then provide us with additional clues as to the likely extent of the trend. In turn\nthis will also be validated by considering the associated volume and price action on slower time frames along\nwith analysing potential support and resistance areas ahead, which might create pause points in any longer\nterm trend,\nTherefore, the first step is always the price action, immediately following a move away from the price congestion\nzone, and this is very similar to the way we identified our congestion entrance using the pivot high and the pivot\nlow, to give us our levels. This gave us our bearings. The previous price action (whatever it may have been)\nhas now paused and is taking a rest. Our pivots have alerted us to this pause, which may be an extended one,\nin which case the levels will be further reinforced with further pivots to the upper and lower levels, or it may be a\ntemporary one, with few pivot points. It may be a reversal, in which case we can expect to see some extensive\nVPA action, or a continuation of the previous trend. All this will be revealed as the price action in this area\nunfolds into our traditional congestion area, with our ceilings and floors in place. However, at some point, the\nmarket will break away, and this is where the pivots come into play once again, only this time to help us define\nthe trend as it develops. Furthermore, it allows us to take advantage as soon as possible and NOT have to wait\nfor the higher highs and higher lows (or lower highs and lower lows ) to develop before entering a position.\nLet's take an example which shows a break out to the up side in Fig 8.11\nFig 8.11 First Marker – Pivot High\nAs we can see in Fig 8.11 the market has been in a consolidation phase and has broken out on robust volume.\nOur analysis signals that this is a valid move, and we are now looking for signs that a trend is likely to develop.\nThe first signal we have is of a market that is rising on solid and generally rising volumes, and we take a\nposition.\nWhat we are waiting for now is our first marker, which just as in the case of our congestion entrance in the\n",

Remember we have a position in the market, and\nprovided volume continues to confirm price, then all is well with the move higher.\nThe pivot points which are now forming, are our markers to highlight the journey and define the boundaries of\nthe trend. Unlike the trend lines which most people draw AFTER the event, these are dynamic and created\nduring the price action, and provided they build in a series of higher and lower levels, then we know that the\ntrend is developing and we stay in our position, provided the volume supports our analysis.\nLet me scroll forward now and add two more levels to the chart, and based on exactly the same principle. From\nour current position, we are now looking for the market to push higher, off the pivot low, and the next target for\nus is a second pivot high, and PROVIDED this is above the previous pivot high, then we are in an upwards\ntrend. Once this second pivot high has formed we are then expecting the market to pullback, but hopefully only\nin a minor way at this stage, and on low volume, at which point we are now looking for our second pivot low.\nThis is duly posted, and provided it is higher that the previous pivot low, we stay in our position, as we are now\nexpecting the market to push off this pivot low and develop the trend further.\nThe market continues higher as expected, and now we are looking for our third pivot high, higher than the\nprevious one, which will then define the upper region of our trend.

If this is higher than the previous pivot low, then we continue to hold and now have\nour third pivot low to define the lower region of the trend.\nThis is how we build trend lines dynamically, whilst simultaneously holding a position in the market based on\nVolume Price Analysis and the fundamental principles of VPA breakouts from sideways congestion, as we can\nsee in Fig 8.14.\n",

The congestion phase sets the scene for\nthe price action, which is then delivered and supported by the volume. The pivots highlight the journey – they\nare like the lights at the side of the road, giving us a clear view of where we are, whilst also giving us the\nconfidence to hold our position in the market.\nFinally, at some point, we see a pivot high posted that is lower or perhaps at the same level as a previous pivot,\nand it is at this point that we are looking at a market that is perhaps moving into a secondary congestion phase,\nwith a pivot low to follow. If this is at a similar level to a previous pivot low then we are in a second congestion\nphase and our analysis continues. Now we are looking for confirming signals with further pivots and finally a\nbreak out. Again, is this a trend reversal, or merely a trend pause? If we break to the downside then it is a trend\nreversal, and we exit our position, but if it is a trend pause, and the trend continues on a break higher, then we\nhold our position, and start the process of building our dynamic trend lines once again.\nNaturally, the above is a text book example of what we want to see on every breakout from a congestion phase,\nbut trading life is rarely text book.

It was the iconic traders of the past with their tape reading skills who laid the\nfoundations for today's VPA traders.\nWell that statement is not entirely true, as in this chapter I want to introduce you to one of the latest\ndevelopments in volume studies, which takes volume and Volume Price Analysis to the next level. This is\ncalled volume at price, or VAP for short. Now we have VPA and VAP – very neat really!\nSo what is volume at price and how does this differ from our studies so far using Volume Price Analysis or VPA.\nBut first, let me introduce a simple concept which I hope will help to explainVAP, and once again we return to\nour wholesaler of goods, who has a warehouse with one product to sell. As a wholesaler, (and indeed anyone\nselling anything) he or she is always looking to maximise profits from each sale, and one of the easiest ways to\ndo this is to 'test the market'.\nThis is something companies do all the time. A product will be marketed at one price, and the volume of sales\nrecorded. The price will then be raised or lowered and the resulting sales recorded and monitored. Obviously, if\nthe wholesaler can sell at a higher price and still maintain the same sales volume, then this will increase profits\nautomatically, with no fall in volume.\nAt some point, the price will reach a point at which volumes do fall, as buyers now perceive the product as over\npriced, and simply stop buying. The wholesaler then simply drops the price lower, and sales volumes should\npick up again.\nOn a simple bar chart, this price action and volume would be reported on a chart which would look similar to\nthat in Fig 9.10 below.\n",

The point here is that we now have a 'map' of volume against price.

All we are seeing in our single volume bar, is the total volume associated with the price spread of the bar.\nWhat this volume bar does NOT reveal, is the levels of buying associated with the different price points, exactly\nas in our simple example above. If we swing this chart through 90 degrees, then we have a perfect\nrepresentation of VAP as it would appear on our chart, as we can see in Fig 9.11\n",

      "text": "Fig 9.11 Sales Volume vs Price – Rotated\nNow perhaps you can begin to see how the principle of volume at price really works, and in many ways the term\nitself describes the methodology. What we are looking at here, is the volume at the price. In other words, we can\nsee the volumes associated with each price level as the market moves higher and lower. What we have is a\nvolume histogram of the buying and selling volumes associated with each price point. We can imagine this as a\ndissection of the single volume bar that we use in Volume Price Analysis (VPA). Here the volume bar records\nall the volume of activity associated within the period of the bar and the spread of the price action.\nWith VAP, what we are doing is taking that volume bar, and cutting it open to reveal where the concentration of\nvolumes actually occurred. After all, if the concentration of volume was at the bottom, then this is more likely to\nbe buying volume rather than selling volume. Conversely, if the concentration of volume took place at the top of\nthe bar rather than at the bottom of the bar, then this is more likely to be selling volume. Volume at price gives\nus a different perspective on the more traditional volume bar, revealing as it does, the concentration of buying\nand selling, at the various price levels, which in turn gives us an alternative perspective, not only in terms of\nmomentum, but also in terms of support and resistance.\nAnd, as far as I am concerned, this is the KEY point.\nThe way to use this methodology is as an enhancement to the classic VPA approach, and NOT to replace it in\nany way. As you will discover shortly, volume at price gives us a very different perspective, as it provides an\ninsight into the concentrations of buying and selling areas, which to me means support and resistance. As we\nhave already discovered how to identify these areas using price, and price action, VAP then gives us an\nadditional tool to use, which gives us a visual representation of these areas on the chart. If you remember back\nto the previous chapter, I referred to support and resistance as invisible barriers, natural barriers if you like –\nwell now, with volume at price, these barriers are actually revealed on our charts.\nHowever, we must remember, VAP is a supporting technique to VPA, NOT the other way round.

So please use VAP as a tool with which to identify price congestion along with\nsupport and resistance zones, which you can then confirm with traditional analysis using VPA.\nLet's look at some examples and the good news is that this indicator, is generally available free on most good\ncharting packages. All the examples in the remainder of this chapter are taken from my NinjaTrader trading\nplatform.\nFig 9.12 Microsoft (MSFT) – 15 Minute Chart\nThe chart in Fig 9.12 is a 15 minute chart for Microsoft, and as you can see, traditional volume bars are\npresented at the bottom of the screen, whilst the volume at price indicator presents the volume distribution on\nthe Y axis vertically, as I explained in my first example.\nNow throughout this book I have tried to explain and reinforce the concept of support and resistance. It is the\nbreeding ground for trends, it is where they are created and fostered and from which they ultimately break free,\nand the beauty of volume at price, is that these areas of price congestion are now painted on the chart visually\nfor us. Therefore, let me explain this chart in broad terms, and highlight what is perhaps obvious, and more\nimportantly, what is not so obvious, at first glance.\nAnd before moving to this example, let me just explain the significance of the colours in the VAP bar. Just as\nwith a conventional volume bar, we have red and blue on the chart which reflect whether the associated candle\nwas up or down. In a VAP bar we have the same, and what each bar represents, with the two colours, is the\nnumber of up or down candles associated with that phase of price action. If there had been more up candles\nthan down then the fulcrum of the bar would be more blue than red. Conversely, if there had been more down\ncandles than up, then the fulcrum would be weighted more red than blue. This in itself gives us a perspective on\nthe balance of ‘buying’ or ‘selling’ at this price range.\nMoving to our example, in simple terms, there are four phases of price congestion here, one at the bottom of the\nchart which continued for an extended period, two in the middle, which were both relatively short and one at the\ntop in the current trading range. The chart covers a 5 day period approximately. What does VAP reveal? First, it\ndefines these regions for us on the chart. Each area of price congestion is marked by the volume histogram\n",

      "text": "which then gives us a sense of the importance of each region. As we would expect, the most dense area of\nvolume is in the first area of price congestion, with two volume bars denoting the significance of this area, one\nabove average and one extreme.\nThe area of congestion above this level is modest by comparison, with only two volume bars of any\nsignificance, both of which are well below average. A very minor area of price congestion indeed.\nNext we move to the third level and here we see more sustained volumes at this level with two above average\nvolume bars denoting an area of price congestion which is significant. Finally, we move to the current price\narea, where we can see one extreme volume bar. What can we deduce from this analysis?\nFirst we can see immediately which of those areas are likely to be significant in the future in terms of resistance\nand support. When these areas are revisited during future price action, then these levels will become our\ninvisible barriers, and from visual volumes we can judge the likely level of support or resistance. Obviously,\ntime also plays a part here. The longer a market is in a congestion phase, then the higher the concentration of\nvolumes we expect to see within the price range. It goes without saying that if the market pauses for days or\nweeks, then all this volume is contained in a relatively narrow price range, which in turn will be reflected in the\nVAP histogram on the left hand side of the chart.\nHowever, whilst this is perhaps an obvious statement to make, what is more revealing as always, is when we\nbring in the time aspect of the volume and price relationship. Let's take a look and see what VAP is telling us\nhere.\nThe chart is over a five day period, and the first phase of price congestion lasted for three days. What we see\nhere is what we expect, some high volume bars confirming a dense region of price congestion. All we can say\nabout this price region is that it is significant, and had we been trading, then on the breakout we would have\nbeen very comfortable with the volume histogram, confirming a strong platform of support below with the market\nbreaking higher. Equally in the future, if the market reverses to test this region, once again we can say with\nconfidence that there is a strong platform of support, which will take some extreme volumes to penetrate and\nbreak.\nMoving to the next area of price congestion, which in this case only lasted for a handful of bars, a few hours at\nmost, before the market broke higher once again, and moved on. This is a secondary area of congestion, and\ninstantly recognisable as such with our VAP volumes. These are below average, and only two are of any\nsignificance, so if this region were tested in the future, it would not take much effort to penetrate this level, either\nfrom below or above.\nFinally, we come to the third and fourth levels of price congestion on the chart which are the most revealing.\nThe first of these lasted 14 price candles (approximately 4 hours) whilst the second lasted the entire session of\na day. However, look at the associated volume bars and compare these to the price congestion that lasted for 3\ndays. The most recent price congestion phase at the top of the chart, which lasted a day, has almost the same\nconcentration of volume as in the first area of price congestion, which lasted for three times as long – 3 days.\nWhat is the volume telling us about this congestion phase of price? And once again, as with all volume analysis\nit is in comparing one with another that the anomalies are revealed giving us the validation we are always\nsearching for in any analysis of price using volume, and in this respect VAP is no different. In this example in\nFig 9.12 we have an intraday chart, with the congestion phase at the bottom of the chart giving us our\nbenchmark against which to measure other areas of price congestion and their significance.\nWhilst the second phase of congestion is, as we would expect, with below average volume bars in a short\nphase of sideways price action, the next level above, our third level, is already starting to ring the alarm bells.\nAnd the reason is this.\nBecause here we see a price congestion phase, over a short period of time, but with above average volume\nbars and spread over a deep area of price. So an alarm signal is sounded. From a trading perspective if we\nwere holding a position, this would give us the confidence on the break out higher, that this was a significant\narea of price support and we could therefore continue to hold the position with confidence.\nThen we arrive at the fourth level on our chart at the top of the price action, with the congestion phase marked\nwith ultra high volume on our VAP, and additional high volume bars in a very narrow trading range on our\n",

It is a daily chart and the chart\nperiod covers around 6 months in total. And, as we can see for the first three months, this stock was in\ncongestion. However, look at the volumes in the VAP. One extreme volume bar with another of average\nvolume. Whilst the congestion phase was long, looking higher up the chart, we see a further phase of\ncongestion, which lasted for two months, but the volume bars here are only moderate and above average. This\ngives us our benchmark as clearly the support platform at the lower level is a substantial one, so in the event of\nany reversal lower, there is an extremely strong, natural barrier in place.\nMore importantly, when the breakout from this region occurred, it moved higher on a gap up, which is always a\nstrong signal, and then validated by our Volume Price Analysis. From there this stock has risen strongly, and\nfollowing the second phase of congestion, has moved higher once more. However, the key thing about the\nsecond congestion phase is that the volumes, relatively speaking, are lower, and therefore this price region may\nnot offer the same degree of support in the event of a reversal lower. This helps when placing our stop orders in\nthe market, which are always governed by our risk and money management rules.\nNevertheless, the point is this. These visual regions created using the VAP approach, give us vital clues and\nsignals which help us in many different ways. They help to validate the current price action. They reveal the\n'depth' of support and resistance in key congestion areas, and they give us confidence on breakouts, when the\nplatform of support or resistance is there for us to see. If it is strong, then we have additional confidence to take\na position, if it is weak, we may hold back and wait for other signals. Finally VAP reveals the strength of support\nand resistance for future price action, which again helps us to visualise and analyse risk.\nNow in the next chapter we are going to examine some further examples using Volume Price Analysis (VPA).\nHowever I would urge you to discover more about VAP for yourself. The examples I have used here have all\nbeen using stocks, but it is a technique that applies equally well to many other markets and instruments.\nThe CME themselves used to provide a facility called Chart -EX which produced a similar picture for traders in\nfutures, but I believe this is no longer available.

These you must supply yourself.\nCharles Brandes (1943-)\nI hope by now I have managed to convince you of the merits and power of Volume Price Analysis in all its\nvarious forms. My purpose in writing this book has been twofold. First to guide you in the direction that I was\nfortunate to take, when I first began trading all those years ago. Albert was a rogue, and even though he has\nattracted many detractors over the years, I for one will always be grateful for the day I happened to stumble\nacross his article in the newspaper. Volume to me just makes sense, it is logical, and is the only way I believe\nthat you can truly see INSIDE market behaviour, manipulated or otherwise. All the charts used here are taken\nfrom either my NinjaTrader platform, or my MT4 brokerage account.\nMy second reason for the book is to explain this methodology in a straightforward way. The markets may be\ncomplex, but they are not complicated or difficult to understand, and if you are prepared to learn and study the\ncharts yourself, you too can become an expert in VPA in no time. There are no short cuts, but just like riding a\nbicycle, once learnt, you will never forget. As I have said before, I do not believe any software program can do\nthe analysis for you. Trading is an art, not a science and the subtleties and nuances of the market are simply\nbeyond the capabilities of machine code, no matter how sophisticated the program. And the principle reason\nwhy trading is an art, is because markets are driven by people and their money and underpinned by fear and\ngreed.\nTherefore, as we near the end of this book, I'd like to to through some examples from various markets, and from\ndifferent platforms. All have volume. Some is actual volume, as in the cash markets and the futures markets,\nothers are from the spot forex market. But all of them have one thing in common. The application of VPA is\nidentical in each case, and where we have VAP data, I have added this as well to complete the picture.\nAnd I would like to start with some examples from the US stock markets and the first chart is the daily chart for\nHoneywell (HON) which if Fig 10.10.\nThis is a nice example which teaches us several lessons on this one chart.

So no anomaly here. This is then followed\nby a narrow spread down candle with higher volume than on the previous bar. This is an anomaly, and could be\nstopping volume. The following day, the market closes with a hammer candle, and high volume again. We are\nnow looking for this stock to pause at this level, perhaps move into a congestion phase, or perhaps see more\naccumulation before a breakout and move higher.\nIn this case, Honeywell moves higher immediately on the following day with a gapped up open, but the volume\nis only average. The following day the price spread is narrow, and although higher on the day, the volume is\nfalling away. This is not a good sign and suggests weakness. The stock is possibly not going to move too far,\nand does move into a congestion phase. However, towards the end of this phase we start to see daily selling\npressure absorbed with a narrow spread down candle and high volume, again an anomaly.

In those days we held this stock and wrote covered calls\nwhich is a great options strategy, and the topic for another book.\nFig 10.11 Duke Energy (DUK) Daily Chart\nOnce again, there are several lessons to be learnt here, and the most valuable one is patience.

When I first started trading using VPA I used to get very excited as soon as I\nsaw a hammer candle, or stopping volume and would immediately take a position in the market.

Therefore, what can we learn from Duke Energy.\nFirst, at the extreme left of the chart we can see that the stock has been rising on relatively low volume. The\nvolume on the last bull candle, a wide spread up candle, is only marginally higher than on the previous candle,\nwhich was half the price spread. Clearly there is an early sign of weakness ahead, which duly arrives two\ncandles later. The stock attempts to rally before entering a price waterfall with falling prices and rising volumes,\nwith stopping volume initially putting the brakes. At this point Duke Energy attempts to move higher, but with a\nwick to the upper body of the candle, this is not a strong response, and the stock price falls further, but on\naverage volumes.\nIn fact the spreads on both of these candles is wide, and when compared to the equivalent spreads in the\nwaterfall, the volumes should be MUCH higher, so clearly selling is being absorbed at this level. Duke Energy\nattempts to rally, this time with a bullish engulfing candle, but the volume is average once again, and clearly this\nis not a sign of strength just yet.\nThe market then pulls back with two small hammers on low volume. Is this the final phase of mopping up the\nselling pressure? The answer is delivered on the next candle with a LOW VOLUME test. The insiders are\npreparing the ground.

It is a straightforward ETF, un-leveraged and is\nbacked by the physical metal. Here we have the 5 min chart, so perfect for an intra day, scalping strategy.\nAs we can see from the chart, starting at the far left the SLV had been moving sideways, albeit with a bullish\ntone before starting to fall, breaking below the interim platform of support with 5 consecutive down candles, on\nrising volume. A signal that the price action was being validated by volume, which at this point is above\naverage.\nThe SLV then drifts sideways for a few bars before we see two narrow spread down candles, the first with\nabove average volume, an anomaly, and the second with extremely high volume. This must be stopping\nvolume and therefore buying, otherwise the candle would be wide. Instead it is narrow. This is followed by the\nhammer candle, on high volume, signalling more buying in the market. The response is muted with the up\ncandle, which moves higher on low volume, not a sign of strength, but is followed on the next candle with rising\nvolume and a wide spread candle, so an encouraging signal. The insiders then test on low volume, and move\nhigher on solid volume, before weakness starts to appear with a wide spread up candle and a subsequent\nfailure at the same level.\nWhat happened next was that SLV then drifted along at this level for some time, before selling off again the\nfollowing day.\nIt would be very easy for me to show you hundreds of examples where VPA gives us great trends and great\ntrading opportunities.

If so, in this case,\nthis would probably have ended as a small profit, a small loss, or perhaps break even. But my point is this.\nThe examples I have chosen here are designed to teach, to educate and also to show you VPA applied in a\nvariety of time frames and markets, and perhaps more importantly, that all trends and trading opportunities are\nrelative. Here we might have taken a position as a scalping trader and netted perhaps 20 or 30 cents on the\ncontract.\nIn the earlier examples with stocks, market positions there may have been in place for days, weeks or even\nmonths and netted hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. It is all relative. The beauty of VPA is that your trading\ndecisions are based on logic. The logic of volume and price. From there, it is down to your skill as a trader to\nbalance your money management with your own risk tolerance and trade accordingly. VPA will give you the\ntrading opportunities, but you will have to judge the risk on the trade, and how much capital you are prepared to\nrisk based on your assessment.\nAnd remember, your assessment of risk will also be based on your analysis using multiple time frames, and in\nthe example above, a slower time frame may well have been signalling a warning that this was a weak move\nand therefore the risk on the trade was high. This may even have been against the dominant trend.

Is this stopping volume – perhaps, and we wait for the next candle to form, a small candle with an\nupper wick, suggestive of further weakness, and coupled with high volume.\nClearly not a positive response to the 'stopping' volume. The next two down candles suggest a modicum of\nbuying on each, with the lower wicks showing some support, but the market continues lower on rising volume\nwith the penultimate candle suggesting stopping volume once again. Finally the last down candle in this price\nwaterfall closes on average volume, followed by the first up candle of the session. A weak response if ever\nthere was one, with a deep upper wick and narrow spread with above average volume. This is hardly a market\nthat is preparing to reverse at this point. The next candle is perfectly valid, a narrow spread up candle with\naverage volume – this looks fine.\nThen we see a repeat of the first candle in this sequence of up candles, but this time, look at the volume – it is\nextremely high. This is sending a LOUD signal that the market is VERY WEAK. If this were buying volume then\nthe market would be rising fast – it isn't, so it must be selling volume. Everyone is selling and trying to get out of\nthe market before it collapses, with every attempt to rise knocked back by the pressure of selling. The next\ncandle is even worse, sending an even stronger signal, if any were needed, that everyone is selling and the\nmarket is now incredibly weak.\nHere we have ultra high volume and a market that is going nowhere. The price spread is narrow, and if the\nvolume were buying, then the market would have risen. The insiders are propping the market up, selling stock\naccumulated in the price waterfall, before taking it lower.\nThe next two candles give no clues, narrow spreads with low volume, then the market sells off sharply, as\nexpected, and validated with ultra high volume, as it lurches lower once again. The next candle hints at\nstopping volume once again with a narrow spread and deep wick on very high volume. The buyers are moving\nin at this level, and this is repeated on the next candle with high volume again on a narrow spread. Now we\nshould see the market recover, but look at the next candle. The market attempts to rise, but falls back to close\nnear the open on above average volume. Not a strong signal. A small hammer follows, on ultra high volume so\nperhaps there are more buyers in the market, and based on the volume of the last few bars, perhaps a reversal\nis now in prospect?\nThree bullish candles then follow, each with a narrow spread, but the volume is flat, so we have a market rising\non flat volume, and therefore unlikely to go very far. The market reverses from this level, and as it falls volumes\nare increasing signalling selling pressure once again. The final candle in this sequence is a very narrow spread\ndoji candle, with high volume, and again we can assume that this is stopping volume with buyers coming in\nonce more.\nThis is confirmed with the next candle which is a wide spread up candle with above average volume, but as the\nmarket rises on the next two candles, volume is falling away. The insiders are not taking this market far. The\nmarket then drifts sideways for an extended period in the session with several attempts to rally all failing, and\nwith volumes generally falling to low levels throughout this phase the market duly closes, looking very weak.\nWhat then happened in the following day’s trading session is that the bearish tone of the previous day was\ntaken up in dramatic fashion, as the GLD opened gapped down once again on three times the volume of the\nprevious day’s open.\n",

Trading volumes on each\ncandle were in excess of 6 million, with average volumes around 500,000. In other words, panic selling.\nEven the hammer candle and the associated volume was not sufficient to slow the market momentum and the\nsolitary wide spread up candle on high volume, failed to follow through, with the market moving into a\ncongestion phase before rising volumes on the four down candles at the end of the sequence signalled yet\nmore bearish pressure and heavy selling.\nThe above market analysis, which I have written here for you in long hand, is really a transcript of the\nconversation that I would have in my head as this price action appeared on the screen and could be for any\nchart, any instrument and in any time frame. All I need is volume to give me a view of what is going on inside\nthe market. With this insight I can draw my conclusions from the price behaviour. The above is on gold, but it\ncould be any ETF or other instrument. It makes no difference.\nI now want to move to the spot forex market and here the charts are from the MT4 platform.

The next candle is also weak, a narrow spread doji\ncandle with high volume. A potential reversal awaits! The next candle confirms the weakness, another shooting\nstar candle this time with higher volume still. And what is also important here, a lower high than the previous\ncandle. This is the time and place to take a short position with a stop loss above the level of the wick of the first\ncandle.\nThe pair sell off and duly start to move lower, and one aspect that I want to highlight here is how volume helps\nyou to stay in a strong position and hold it in order to maximise your profits from the trend.\nAs we all know, markets never move in a straight line, they move lower, then pull back a little, before then\nmoving lower again. Here we can see this in action perfectly illustrated, and the point I want to make is this.\nFour bars after the second shooting star, we have a wide spread down candle, and we are delighted. Our\nanalysis has been proved correct, and we are now in a strong position. Then the market begins to reverse\nagainst us. Is this a trend reversal, or merely a pause in the move lower?\nWell, the first candle appears. The spread is relatively narrow and the volume is above average, so this is an\nencouraging sign. In addition, we have not seen any evidence of stopping volume with narrowing spreads and\nrising volume, so this looks like a pause point. The next candle confirms this as does the third, and on the\ncompletion of this last candle we can see that we have a market attempting to rise on falling volume, and we\nknow what that means!\nThe next candle is weak, and whilst the volume is below average it is another small shooting star.\nThe market moves lower in steps and each attempt to rally is seen in the context of falling volume, confirming\nthe weakness further which is my point.\nOnce you have a position in the market, you must keep revisiting your VPA techniques as they will give you the\nconfidence to hold and stay in the trend. If you are short the market and it pulls back against you, but the volume\non the upwards moves is falling, then you KNOW that this is simply a temporary pullback and not a change in\n",

Equally, if any pullback has not been pre-ceded with signs of stopping volume, then the buyers are not in\nthe market at that level and any reversal will not last long, so you can continue too hold.\nEqually, if you are long the market the same applies. In an up trend the market will pull back against you. If the\nvolume is falling on these pull backs then you KNOW this is simply a minor reversal lower and not a change in\ntrend, particularly if you have seen no topping out volume.\nFinally as we can see on the right hand side of the chart, stopping volume finally appeared, with the market\nmoving into a congestion phase with the selling pressure dropping away to below average. The pair completed\nthis phase of its journey and we exit.\nOur entry, our management, and exit of this position have all been executed using one simple tool. VPA.\nNothing else. Why more traders, speculators and investors don't pay attention to volume is beyond me, but\nthere we are.\nHere are some further examples from the world of spot forex.\nFig 10.17 AUD/USD – Weekly Spot Forex Chart : Selling Climax\nThe reason I’ve chosen the weekly chart for the AUD/USD is that not only is it a good example of a selling\nclimax, it also gives us a perspective on how long this may last. As I have said several times in this book, we\nhave to be patient. Major changes in trend take time to come into effect, and this is an example. It also shows\nthat VPA works in all time frames.\nRemember, here we are looking at a period of around 18 months, so long term trends with big profits to be\nmade if you are patient, and believe in the power of VPA of course!\nAs we can see from the chart the AUD/USD pair has been bullish, before moving into a congestion phase on\naverage volume. Then we see our first anomaly. A narrow spread up candle with very high volume. The pair are\nstruggling at this price point and the market is not responding. The next weekly candle arrives with ultra high\nvolume, and if this pair were going to sell off sharply, then we would expect this to be a wide spread down\ncandle – it isn't. It's a narrow spread. The buyers must be supporting the market at this level. The next candle\narrives, a hammer with a deep wick, and this confirms the previous candle. This is buying, and now we wait for\nany further signals, which arrive on the next candle, a low volume test on a smaller hammer candle. The high\nvolume selling that we were seeing in the previous candle, which was absorbed by the buyers, has now\ndissipated and the forex market makers are ready to take this pair higher. And off it goes at a nice steady pace,\n",

      "text": "marching higher on nice steady volume.\nThe move higher extends over several months, but the point to note here, is the slow steady fall in volume over\nthis period. It's not dramatic, just a steady fall, and then as we enter the yellow box on the chart – what do we\nsee? Two wide bars, one after the other, but look at the volume. It has fallen away to almost nothing. This is a\nHUGE warning signal that this pair is becoming exhausted, and either running out of steam, or there is some\nalternative explanation. What is clear, is that the market makers are moving prices higher with NO volume, and\nhave withdrawn from the market.\nTraders who have missed this long trend higher, are now jumping in on fear and greed. They fear missing out\non a golden opportunity. After all, they have watched this market go up and up, and have finally caved in and\nbought, just when the market makers are leaving by the side door.\nThen the selling climax begins. The market makers are selling in huge volumes at this level, before finally after\nseveral weeks the pair break lower, and attempts to rally giving us signs of further weakness, before breaking\nlower again.\nNote the attempt to rally at the right hand edge of the chart. Here we see narrow spread up candles on very high\nvolume, and falling, another very strong signal of further weakness to come, which duly arrives.\nOne point I do want to cover here in a little more detail is the whole issue of rising and falling volumes when\nassociated with trends, because we do have to apply some flexibility to any analysis and interpretation here.\nAfter all, if the market moved higher for ten consecutive bars, and you wanted to apply the volume principle to\nthe letter of the law, then you would have to see 10 volume bars each higher than the last. Clearly this would\nplace a limit on how far any trend could go, since it is unreasonable to expect volumes to go up and up and up\nfor ever!\nThe above example is a case in point. The first few candles on the up move are supported by good volume,\nwhich is up and down, but above, or just around, average. This is fine. After all, there are always going to be\nvariations particularly when you begin to look at the longer term timescales. There may be seasonal effects,\ndays when the markets are thinly traded during holidays, and of course days when the markets actually close.\nThis rarely happens in forex, but it does happen in other markets and affects the forex markets accordingly.\nPlease be a little flexible in your approach when judging volume in trends, and allow a little bit of latitude in your\nanalysis. Here we were waiting for an anomaly, and until the two low volume candles arrived, there was nothing\nto signal that any change in trend was imminent.\nI now want to consider the opposite, namely a buying climax and once again we have a nice example on the\nAUD/USD weekly chart in Fig 10.18 below.\nOn this chart, we are looking at an eighteen month period approximately, and we can see that the pair has\ntopped out and rolled over into a nice price waterfall, all confirmed with nicely rising selling volumes, validating\nthe move lower.\nThen a hammer candle arrives and we need to assess whether there is sufficient stopping volume? The next\ncandle gives us the answer with a small shooting star on high volume.\n",

However, as the pair attempt to rally the first candle we see is a narrow spread up candle with a\ndeep upper wick, hardly a sign of strength, on high volume. The pair are not ready to rise just yet, and the\nfollowing two candles confirm this, with very low volume. The second of these is particularly significant with a\nwide spread and ultra low volume.\nThe AUD/USD pair then roll over again and back down into the congestion area, which I have marked on the\nchart with the two yellow lines, and this is the ceiling of resistance that we would now be monitoring, along with\nthe floor of support below.\nAny break above through this resistance area would now need to be supported with good rising volume. It\ndoesn't have to be 'explosive' volume, and in many ways it is better that it isn't – just steady and rising. If this\nwere a gap up breakout, as we saw in earlier examples, then we do expect to see volumes well above average,\nand even ultra high if the move is dramatic. But for normal breakouts through an area of resistance, then above\naverage is fine.\nThe pair then develop a nice even trend higher, with some pauses along the way. This trend lasted for over\nnine months before finally running out of steam with a selling climax developing.\nI now want to move into the world of futures and back to my NinjaTrader platform. The first chart is the 5 minute\non the YM E-mini futures contract, an extremely popular index futures contract for scalping, and derived from the\nDow Jones Industrial Average in the cash market.\nThere are two versions of the index, the 'small' Dow and the 'big' Dow. This is the small Dow with each index\npoint worth $5, whilst the big Dow is $25. I ALWAYS recommend new traders to any market to start with the\nsmallest instrument, so if you are new to index trading or indeed the futures market in general, start with the mini\nDow.\nThe reason I wanted to show this example is really to focus on the open of the market. As I explained earlier,\nthese contracts now trade virtually 24 hours a day, and therefore the open of the physical market is not the\nsurprise that it once was, as this will generally follow the trend of the electronic contract, which will have been\ntrading overnight following the close of the exchange.\n",

First, we have a gapped up open, so the electronic contract must have ticked up from the\nphysical close of the day before, which you can see here. Volume is high and a nice wide spread up candle\ncloses the first five minutes of trading. The big operators are joining the move. The next two candles are down,\nbut the volume is falling, so we do not expect the market to move far, and indeed the lower wick on the second\nof these candles, is a clue that this is simply some early profit taking on the gap up open, and that the buyers\nare in control.\nFrom there, the market moves steadily higher. There are no signals of a reversal, just a steady rise, with minor\npull backs, but each time we see a little wave lower, then this is balanced by a wave higher in the volume trend,\nwhich is what I was trying to describe earlier. You do have to be a little flexible in how you view volume in a\nrising (or falling) trend. What is interesting here is if we compare the first 'wave' with the second 'wave' in terms\nof the buying volumes. Volumes on the second wave in the up move, are slightly lower than volumes in the first\nwave, so we may begin to think that perhaps this move was running out of steam, and possibly time to exit the\ntrend. However, there is nothing particularly frightening in any of the subsequent price action, and indeed as we\ncan see on the right of the chart, the down candles have very low volumes. But interest appears to be waning\nand we need to be vigilant.\nOne further point on this chart, before we move on to look at another.\nThe move higher after the first few candles of the open would also have given us confidence as the index broke\nabove the initial resistance area created at the open. This is only a secondary resistance level, but nevertheless\nanother 'confidence builder' for us in taking a position in this market. The same applies at the right hand side of\nthe chart as the market moves into a congestion phase, and coupled with the general decline in volumes, this\nmay prompt us to exit at this stage.\n",

In this example we are looking at a 10 minute chart, and here we have a\ncomplete daily session, sandwiched between a day either side.\nWorking from left to right, as the trading session comes to an end we can see the extremely high volume bar in\nred, standing like a telegraph pole above all the others. The big operators are clearing out of the market\npreparing for the following day. This ultra high volume is associated with a shooting star candle, a sure sign of\nselling, followed by an up candle with very high volume, which goes nowhere. The big operators are selling into\nthe market and struggling to hold it at this level. Finally, the session ends with a small doji on average volume.\nThe following day, the market opens at much the same level as the close of the night before, with a classic trap\nup move by the big operators, a wide spread up candle on low to average volume. Compare this volume with\nthat of the up candle of the night before following the shooting star candle. The price spread is much the same,\nbut the volume is substantially lower.\nThis is a TRAP up move, and one that was prepared the night before. It is a classic move that happens all the\ntime, particularly at the open of a session, and you will see this time and time again in the futures markets and\nthe cash markets. The insiders, whether they are the operators or the market makers, love to trap traders into\nweak positions, and this is the easiest time to do it, when traders are waiting for the market to open, eager with\nanticipation, and jump in making emotional trading decisions, frightened to miss out on a nice move higher or\nlower. Then the selling starts, and down it goes! Easy really, and given the chance we would do the same! It\ngoes without saying that volume is the ONLY way to see these tricks in action – watch out for them and you will\nsee them ALL the time, in every market, and in every time frame.\nFinally, and just to prove the point, on the third day on our chart the market opens gapped up, but look at the\nvolume – it's high, and well above the volume of the previous day, so this is a genuine move, and the big\noperators are buying into the bullish trend higher.\nMoving to yet another platform, a different market and a different type of chart.

      "text": "considered in our volume analysis have been based on time, but many traders, myself included like to trade tick\ncharts for some markets. If you have never used such charts to trade, then I would urge you to consider these as\npart of your trading education, for one simple reason.\nWhen we trade on a time based chart, for example a 15 minute chart, every bar or candle on the chart is created\nin 15 minutes. By contrast when we trade on an 80 tick chart, each candle will be created according to the time\nit takes to complete. In other words, the time taken to build each candle will depend on the energy and activity in\nthe market. It is, yet another way to consider volume or market activity. A tick on a futures chart essentially\nrecords an order, but that order could be for one contract or a hundred contracts. However, the point with a tick\nchart is this. If the market is very active and there is a great deal of buying and selling, let's say after a news\nannouncement, then each 80 tick candle will form very quickly, perhaps in just a few seconds, as there are\nhundreds of orders flowing through the market in a very short space of time, each of which is recorded as a tick.\nTherefore if we were watching a tick chart following the release of the NFP data, then the candles would form\nas though being fired from a machine gun – they would literally print on the chart at high speed, but each tick\ncandle would take a different length of time to form. So in seeing the speed of creation of the tick candles, we\nare also, in a sense, seeing inside the market and the 'volume' or activity that is associated with this buying and\nselling frenzy.\nThis is something you will NEVER see on a time based chart, since each candle is defined by the time frame of\nthe chart. On a tick chart it is not, and this is a key difference and why many full time traders and professional\ntraders only use tick charts.\nTo put this into context for you, imagine a tick chart in the following scenarios.\nFirst in the example above, the open of the New York trading session and an NFP data release. Each 80 tick\ncandle would form in seconds and perhaps in milliseconds. Now imagine the same chart overnight in Asia,\nwhere perhaps we are overlapping the close of one market and the opening of another. Then the time taken for\neach candle on the chart might be 30 seconds, perhaps even a few minutes.\nAnd the point is this. With a tick chart, you see the activity visually with the speed the candles are created. With\na time chart, you never see the activity, just a price moving higher or lower as the candle forms. This is the\ndifference between tick and time based charts and is why many traders prefer to trade on tick charts. With a tick\nchart, we are seeing 'inside the market' and it is reinforcing our volume analysis. After all, volume is really\nnothing more than 'activity' which is what we see visually with a tick chart.\nOne important point about tick charts is if the volume is also represented as ticks, all we would see would be a\nseries of 'soldiers' of equal height, with each one representing 80 ticks or 80 transactions. In order to overcome\nthis problem, most platforms will provide the option of selecting either tick volume or trade volume when setting\nup a chart, and this is certainly the case with another of my trading accounts. Here we simply select trade\nvolume when setting up the chart, rather than tick volume, and we then have volume reported in trade size,\nwhich gives us our variable volume bars.\n",

Volume spikes higher and continues to rise with the\nmarket which marches North in nice, even wide spread candles. However, on the 9th volume bar, we see our\nfirst sign of weakness, ultra high volume and no price action to match. The candle spread is wide, but judged\nagainst the candles and price action that has just pre-ceded it, the reaction from the market should have been\nmuch stronger. This signals weakness and the large operators are starting to struggle, although there is only a\nsmall upper wick on the candle at this point.\nThe market then goes into consolidation with above average volume and narrow spread up candles with wicks\nto the upper body, confirming the initial weakness first seen in the trend higher. The market then rolls over and\nsells off on high volume, and the attempt to recover, is marked with rising prices and falling volumes, a further\nsign of weakness. This is duly confirmed again with the price action at this level marked with a shooting star\ncandle, the catalyst for the price waterfall which followed.\nIt is interesting to note, even though I did not add this example for this particular reason, but the recovery from\nthe price waterfall appears to have occurred with little evidence of buying volume or stopping volume. This in\nitself is suspicious. After all, this is a significant fall, and despite being a fast intraday chart, we would still expect\nto see high volumes at the bottom. Therefore could this action be a further extended trap up move higher on low\nvolume? Not quite and this is where we always have to be careful.\nThe volumes in the move up were so extreme they tended to distort the volumes elsewhere during the session,\nand in fact scrolling forward, the volumes at the bottom of the price waterfall were well above average, but\ndistorted by the volumes in the bullish trend. Nevertheless, this coffee future did sell off the following day and\nnever moved higher during this session. Therefore, this is always a point worth remembering. Whatever the\ninstrument we are trading, we must try to have an idea of what is considered to be high, low and average\nvolume. So that when these extremes of volume do appear, they do not distort our view of what follows in the\nremainder of the trading session.\nFinally, to round off this chapter I would like to examine one of the most widely followed indices around the\nworld, and that is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow 30 is considered to be, by the media, who know\nvery little if anything about the financial markets, a leading benchmark of the US economy. It is not, but never\nmind, and it simply gives me a topic for another book!\nI wanted to end this chapter with this index, as it really makes the powerful point, that VPA works in all time\nframes for all instruments and for all markets.

It is so obvious, and\nproves the point about VPA. Your eye should be drawn instantly to those anomalies, of either extreme highs,\nextreme lows, or concentration of volumes in certain areas. From there, you then dig deeper and take a more\nforensic view at the macro level. This is a classic chart with the market rising, then rolling over a little, before\nrising further, then rolling over again with the classic rounded tops.\nThe market makers came into the market strongly over an eleven week period (the yellow box), and then\ncontinued to stock up over the next six to eight weeks at this level, so the market was consolidating in this\nregion for 4 - 5 months. This is the length of time that accumulation may take, and no move will be made until\nthey are ready.\nThe question everyone is now asking, is how much further can this market go, and the answer is to look at the\nvolume.

Like the battlefield, it runs on probabilities and odds.\nDavid Dreman (1936-)\nAs we come towards the end of this book on volume and price, I wanted to pass on some thoughts,\nobservations, advice and comments based on my sixteen years of experience, using volume as my\npredominant indicator. As I have said before, I was lucky to start my trading education and journey with volume.\nIt saved me a huge amount of wasted time and has made me substantial sums over the years from both trading\nand investing. Many aspiring traders spend years trying systems and methods which never work, and result in\nthem losing confidence, to say nothing of their financial losses. Most then simply give up.\nEventually some of these traders and investors stumble upon volume. Some buy into the methodology instantly,\njust as I did. Others do not, and if you are in this latter group, I hope that I have at least made the case for VPA in\nthis book. However, if you decide VPA is not for you, then you have lost nothing, other than the few dollars this\nbook has cost you. If you do decide that VPA is logical and makes perfect sense, then I am delighted, as a\nlifetime of trading and investing success awaits. Provided you follow the principles I have explained here.\nNow, let me introduce some further analytical techniques that I use in my own trading, which when combined\nwith the basics of VPA, will help to develop your trading skills, with volume as the foundation.\nThe first technique I would like to explain is price pattern recognition, which we covered when we considered\nthe importance of price congestion. However, I want to revisit it here, and look at some actual market examples.\nAt the same time I would also like to include other key patterns that play an important role in breakouts and\nreversals, all of which ties into Volume Price Analysis.\nThe reason for revisiting price pattern recognition is that in the previous chapter I was very conscious of keeping\nthe focus on the volume price relationship, and less so on the broader price behaviour on the chart. My rationale\nthroughout the book has been to explain VPA in stages, and this is another layer that we can now add to our\nknowledge of VPA.\nThe market chart examples in this chapter will focus entirely on market congestion and subsequent reversals\nand breakouts, which I hope will cement this aspect of price behaviour firmly in your mind.\nThe first is a lovely example from the forex market and is from the 15 minute chart for cable (GBP\\USD).\nFig 11.10 GBP/USD – 15m Chart\nThe chart in Fig 11.10 really explains all we need to know about price congestion and how it relates to the\n",

      "text": "volume breakout when it arrives. As we can see the chart covers an extensive period with 70 candles in this\nphase.\nThe initial entry into the congestion phase is marked by a pivot low which gives us the floor of our price\ncongestion, and two bars later a pivot high is posted with above average volume. The GBP/USD is weak and\nnot ready to move higher with the pair then falling on declining volume, so weakness, but not a trend that will be\nsustained. And the reason should now be obvious - falling prices and falling volumes. Volumes then decline in\ngeneral moving between buying and selling, and as the market moves sideways in the congestion phase, we\nsee two further pivot highs posted, followed by a pivot low.\nThese are followed by a whole series of pivots, both at the ceiling and the floor of the congestion, and as I\nexplained earlier when we were examining this concept, you do have to think of these levels as rubber bands\nand not as rods of steel.\nWe can see in this example that the pivot points (the little yellow arrows), are not all in a straight line. The\nmarket is not linear and technical analysis is an art and NOT a science, which is why volume software that\nattempts to predict changes in trend can be unreliable. This analysis has to be done manually.\nAt this stage, as the price continues to trade within the congestion, we are waiting for the catalyst, which will be\nthe signal for any breakout. And on this occasion was provided by an item of economic data in the UK. From\nmemory I believe it was the RPI release. However, the actual release is unimportant. What is important is the\nreaction on the price chart.\nFirst, we have a breakout which moves firmly through our ceiling of resistance, which has now become......\nsupport. And if you remember what I said in the chapter on breakouts – we MUST wait for a clear close well\nabove the congestion phase, and the first candle here delivered this for us. A nice wide spread up candle.\nSecond, we have to check that this is a valid move, and the good news is the breakout has been validated by\nthe volume.\nAs this has been an extensive area of price congestion, any break away will require substantial effort which is\nwhat we have here with buyers taking the market firmly higher. Can we join the move here? This is what we\nhave been waiting for. We have a market that has been in congestion, waiting, and gathering itself, when finally\nthe catalyst arrives and the market moves on high volume.\nFurthermore, we now have a deep area of natural price protection in place below, and our stop loss would be\nbelow the level of the last pivot low. Time has also played its part here, with cause and effect coming into play.\nRemember, this is a 15 minute chart, so an extended phase of consolidation and congestion, and therefore any\nconsequent effect should reflect the time taken in building the cause. In other words, the trend, when it breaks,\nshould last for some time. We just have to be patient, and wait!\nFinally, there is one further aspect to the breakout, which again I mentioned in an earlier chapter and it is this –\nthe volume has validated the news. The market makers have confirmed that the data is good news for the UK\npound, and the market has responded. Volumes pick up once again as the market moves higher and away from\nthe congestion phase, and to return to my salmon analogy, another trend has been spawned.\nThis is the power of the congestion phase – it is the spawning ground of trends and reversals. In this case the\nceiling was breached, but it could equally have been the floor. The direction is irrelevant. All we wait for is\nconfirmation of the breakout, validated with volume, and then trade accordingly.\nThe second example in Fig 11.11 is once again taken from the GBP/USD. This time we are looking at the\nhourly chart over a period of approximately 4 days in total.\n",

      "text": "Fig 11.11 GBP/USD – 1 Hour Chart\nOnce again here let me explain the highlights and key points. As we can see the pair has been rising, but the\nmarket moves lower as shown by a wide spread down candle. This is followed by a narrow spread down\ncandle with above average volume, and signalling possible buying on this reversal lower. The market pushes\nhigher on the next candle, a wide spread up bar, and posts a pivot low as shown with the small yellow arrow.\nWe are now looking for a possible pivot high which will start to define a potential period of congestion.\nThis duly arrives two bars later, and the pivot high is now in place. Now we are watching for a potential\ncongestion phase, and further pivots to define the trading range. However, on this occasion, the next candle\nbreaks higher and moves firmly away from this area. The potential congestion phase we were expecting has\nnot materialised, so we know this was simply a minor pause in the trend higher, as the pair move up on good\nvolume.\nTwo candles later, another pivot high is formed, and once again we are now looking for our pivot low to form\nand define our levels of any congestion phase. In this example the pair do indeed move into congestion, with\nlow volume, and on each rally a pivot high is posted which gives us a nicely defined ceiling. However, there are\nno pivots defining the floor. Does this matter?\nAnd this is the reason I wanted to highlight this example to make the point, that in fact it doesn't.\nA pivot is a unique combination of three candles which then create the pivot, and this helps to define the region\nfor us visually. Pivots also help to give us our 'roadmap' signals of where we are in the price journey. But,\nsometimes one or other does not arrive, and we have to rely on our eyes to define these levels. After all, a pivot\nis simply an indicator to make it easier for us to see these signals. In this case the pivot high forms, but there is\nno corresponding pivot low, so we are looking for a 'floor' to form.\nAfter four candles, the market moves higher again and posts a second pivot high, so we have our ceiling well\ndefined, and this is now resistance. The next phase lower made up of three candles then stops at the same\nprice level, before reversing higher again. We know this pair is not going to fall far anyway, as we have a falling\nmarket and falling volume. Our floor of support is now well defined by the price action, and it is clear from the\nassociated volume, that we are in a congestion phase at this level. And, my point is this.\nWhen using any analytical method in technical analysis, we always have to apply a degree of leeway and\ncommon sense. Whenever a market moves into a region of price congestion, it will not always develop the\nperfect combinations of pivot highs and pivot lows, and we then have to apply common sense as here,\nbolstered, of course, by our volume. At the start of this congestion phase, we have a very good idea that we are\nentering a congestion phase, simply from an assessment of the volume. The volume is all well below average\n",

      "text": "(the white dotted line) therefore we already know that we are in a congestion phase, and the pivots are merely\naids, to help define the price region for us.\nTherefore whilst pivots are very important it is the volume which will also help to define the start of a congestion\nphase, and the pivot highs and lows are there to help to define the floors and ceilings of the trading range. If one\nor other is missing, then we simply revert to using our eyes and common sense.\nThe analogy I use here is when sailing. When we are sailing our boat, we have two forms of navigation. A GPS\nplotter which does all the work for us which is nice and easy, and the old fashioned way using a map, compass,\ntime, tides and way points. In order to pass the exams and charter a yacht, you have to learn both. And the\nreason for this is very simple. If there is a loss of power on board, then you have to be able to navigate using a\npaper based chart. The same principle applies here.\nWe can define where we are by using volume and price visually from the price action on the chart. The pivots\nare simply there as a quick visual guide, to help identify these price combinations quickly and easily.\nReturning to our example in Fig 11.11, we now have the floor defined by our price action and the ceiling defined\nby our pivot highs. We are now waiting for a signal, and it duly arrives in the form of a hanging man, one of the\ncandles we have not seen in earlier examples, and suddenly the volume has jumped higher and is well above\naverage. The market breaks lower and through the floor of our congestion phase with a wide spread down\ncandle. We now know that, on this occasion, the price congestion phase has been developing into a trend\nreversal, and is not a continuation of the existing trend.\nIt is here that we would be looking to take a short position. The market pauses and reverses higher but the\nvolume is falling, and in addition we see a second hanging man candle, suggesting more weakness in the\nmarket. We also have the comfort of knowing that above us we have one of our invisible barriers of price\ncongestion.\nWhat was the floor of support, has now become the ceiling of price resistance as the market attempts to recover,\nand this is why congestion zones are so significant to us as traders. Not only do they spawn the trend reversals\nand breakouts, but they also give us our natural barriers of protection which have been created by the market.\nWhere better to place any stop loss than on the opposite side of a congestion region.\nThe resistance region holds, and the market sells off sharply with a beautiful price waterfall. However, as the\nbearish trend develops, so the volumes are falling away, and we know as VPA traders that this trend is not\ngoing too far. And sure enough, after seven hours of downwards movement, it bottoms out and moves\ninto….......another congestion phase at a different price level.\nIronically, here too, we have a phase which is once again marked by pivot highs, but no pivot lows. However,\nthe volume and price action tell us exactly where we are in the price journey. We simply wait for the next phase\nto start, which it does, several hours later. Again, how do we know? Volume gives us the answer. The breakout\nhas been associated with above average volume, which is what we expect to see, and off we go again.\nI hope that from this example, which spans a period of four days or so, you can begin to see how everything\ncomes together. I did not particularly select this example, but it does highlight several key points that I hope will\nreinforce and cement the concepts outlined in earlier chapters.\nReading a chart in this way is not difficult. Every market moves in this way. They trend for a little, then\nconsolidate in a congestion phase, then continue the trend or reverse completely. If you understand the power\nof VPA and combine it with a knowledge of price congestion, then you are 90% of the way there. The rest is\npractice, practice and more practice, and it will come.\nFurthermore, you will then realise the power this gives you in your own trading and how it can deliver financial\nindependence to you and your family. It does takes a little effort, but the rewards are high, and if you are\nprepared to study and learn, then you will enjoy the thrill of being able to forecast market price action, before it\nhappens, and profit accordingly.\nI would now like to revisit a very important concept, that I touched on earlier in the book. It is a cornerstone of my\napproach to trading. Again, it is not unique and can be applied to any market and any instrument. Neither is it\nunique to VPA. What this concept does do, is give you that three dimensional view of price behaviour, as\n",

      "text": "opposed to the more conventional one dimensional approach that most traders take. The principle advantage of\nthis concept is that it allows us to assess and quantify the risk on a trade.\nThis concept involves using multiple time frames to analyse price and volume. It allows us to qualify and\nquantify the risk of any trade, and assess the relative strength or weakness of any trade, and so its likely\nduration. In other words, multiple time frames will reveal the dominant trend and primary bias of the instrument\nunder consideration.\nFig 11.12 represents our three time frames. Despite its size we can see both price and volume and this method\nof analysis is something I teach in my online and offline seminars.\nFig 11.12 GBP/USD – Multiple Time Frames\nWhat we have in Fig 11.12 are three charts for cable (GBP/USD). The chart at the top of the image is the 30\nminute and is what I often refer to as our ‘benchmark’ chart. In this trio it is this chart which gives us our bias,\nand is the one against which we relate the other two. Bottom right is the 15 minute, and the chart at bottom left is\nthe 5 minute. All the charts are taken from one of my favourite platforms for spot forex, namely MT4.\nThe candle I have highlighted on the 30 minute chart is a shooting star, with ultra high volume, sending a clear\nsignal of weakness at this level. The shooting star was pre-ceded by a narrow spread candle also with ultra\nhigh volume, and which gave us our initial signal. But how does this appear on our faster time frames? On the\n15 minute chart the shooting star is two candles, and on our 5 minute chart it is six candles. I have annotated\nthe chart with the yellow box on each to show you the associated price action.\nNow the reason I use three charts is very simple. My primary trading chart is the 'middle' time frame of the three.\nIn this example it is the 15 minute chart, but using the MT4 chart settings we might equally have a 30 minute, 60\nminute and 240 minute chart. In this trio our primary trading chart would be the 60 minute. However, in this\nexample we are using a 5, 15, 30 minute combination, so the primary or trading chart is our 15 minute.\nThe 30 minute chart is there as our slower time frame, our dominant or benchmark time frame, which tells us\nwhere we are in the slower time frame trend. Imagine we are looking at price action using a telescope. This is\nwhere we are viewing from some way off, so we can see all the price action of the last few days.\nThen using our telescope we start to zoom in, first onto the 15 minute chart, and then in fine detail to the 5\nminute chart. By using the 15 minute chart we are seeing both sides of the price action if you. A slower time\nframe helps in gaining a perspective on where we are in the longer term journey, and a faster time frame on the\nother side will give us the fine detail view of the related price action.\nWhat do we see here? First the shooting star sent a clear signal of weakness, and on our 15 minute chart this is\nreflected in two candles, with high volume on the up candle which is also topped with a deep wick to the upper\nbody. And here the point is this. If we had seen this price action in isolation on the 15 minute chart, it may not\nhave been immediately obvious what we were looking at here.\n",

      "text": "It takes a mental leap to lay one candle over another and imagine what the result may be. The 30 minute chart\ndoes this for us, and in addition, and perhaps more importantly, if we had a position in the market, the 30 minute\nchart is instantly more recognisable as possible weakness than the 15 minute. So two benefits in one.\nIf putting two candles together to create one is difficult, putting six candles together is almost impossible, and\nyet this is the same price action represented on the 5 minute chart. The market then moves into consolidation,\nwhich again is much easier to see on the slower time frame chart than the faster ones, and I have deliberately\nleft the pivot points off these charts, so that the charts remain as clear as possible.\nThe next point is this. In displaying a slower time frame above, this also gives us a perspective on the\n'dominant' trend. If the dominant trend is bullish on the 30 minute chart, and we decide to take a position on our\n15 minute chart which is bullish, then the risk on the trade is lower, since we are trading with the dominant\ntrend. We are trading with the flow, and not against the flow. Swimming with the tide and not against it.\nIf we take a position that is against the dominant trend in our slower time frame, then we are counter trend\ntrading, and two conditions then apply. First, the risk on the trade is higher, since we are trading against the\ndominant trend of our lower time frame, and second, we are unlikely to be holding the position long, since the\ndominant trend is in the opposite direction.\nIn other words, what we are trading here is a pull back or a reversal. There is nothing wrong with this, as\neverything in trading is relative. After all a reversal on a daily chart might last several days. It is all relative to the\ntime frame.\nThe third reason for using multiple charts is that this also gives us a perspective on changes in trend as they\nripple through the market, this time in the opposite direction. The analogy I use here is of the ripples in a pond.\nWhen you throw a pebble into the centre of a small pond, as the pebble hits the water, the ripples move out and\naway before they eventually reach the edge of the pond. This is what happens with market price action.\nAny potential change in trend will be signalled on our fast time frame chart. This is where you will see sudden\nchanges in price and volume appear first. If this is a true change, then the effect will then appear on the primary\nchart, which in this case is the 15 minute chart, before the change ultimately ripples through to our 30 minute\nchart, at which point this change is now being signalled on the dominant chart.\nThis is how to trade, as we constantly scan from the slower to the faster and back again, checking and looking\nfor clues and confirming signals between the three time frames, with VPA sitting at the centre of our analysis.\nEven if you ultimately decide that VPA is not for you, trading using multiple time frames is a powerful approach\nwhich will give you a three dimensional view of the market. You can have more than three, but for me three is\nsufficient, and I hope will work for you as well.\nFinally to end this chapter, I would like to include a short section on the candle patterns I have found work, and\nwork consistently. And you will not be surprised to learn, all these patterns work particularly well with price\nsupport and resistance, as well as price congestion.\nBy watching for these candle patterns whenever the market is in a consolidation phase and preparing for a\nmove, coupled with VPA and multiple time frame analysis, this will add a further dimension to your trading. And\nthe patterns I would like to consider here are the falling triangle, the rising triangle, pennants and finally triple\ntops and bottoms.\n",

We can see immediately from the volume, that we are in a congestion phase, but in this\ncase the market is also moving lower. Each attempt to rally is seen as a series of lower highs, and is a clear\nsignal of weakness. If this market is going to break anywhere, there is a strong chance that it will be to the\ndownside, since each attempt to rally is becoming weaker and weaker in terms of the high of the candles. The\nfloor of the congestion area is very well defined, and any sustained break below here will be signalled with\nvolume.\nAs with all price patterns, the falling triangle appears in all time frames and on all charts, and we must always\nremember Wyckoff's rule of cause and effect. If the cause is large then the effect will be equally large. In this\ncase we are looking at a 5 minute chart, but this type of congestion will often appear on daily and weekly charts\nand is immensely powerful in generating new trends, or reversals in trend, on the breakout.\n",

      "text": "Chapter Twelve\nVolume And Price – The Next Generation\nMy biggest winnings were not in dollars but in the intangibles: I had been right, I had looked ahead and\nfollowed a clear cut plan.\nJesse Livermore (1877-1940)\nI began this book by stating that there is nothing new in trading, and indeed this is certainly true in terms of\nvolume. Its foundations were laid by the iconic traders of the last century, and since then, little has changed.\nThe methodology remains as valid today, as it was then. The only changes have been in technology and\nmarkets. Other than that, we use the same principles as they used, all those years ago.\nHowever, that said, as a devotee of volume, I am constantly looking for developments in this analytical\napproach to the market, which has formed the cornerstone of my own trading career. I would be foolish to ignore\nthem. After all, candlesticks were virtually unheard of in Western trading before the 1990’s - now they are the\n‘de facto’ standard for technical traders.\nTherefore in this final chapter, I would like to introduce you to some of the latest developments in volume and\nprice analysis, which are both new and innovative. I have not used these myself, so cannot comment on their\nvalidity, but feel it is important to present them here, and as this book is updated in future versions, I can then\nadd further chapters as these techniques develop and perhaps incorporate them into my own trading.\nEquivolume Charts\nThe volume price approach termed ‘equivolume’ was developed by Richard Arms and first published in his\nbook, Volume Cycles In The Stock Market, written in 1994. The concept is one in which volume is considered to\nbe more important than time, and as such the X axis of the chart is replaced with volume, whilst the Y axis\nremains as before with price. The principle idea is that in adopting this approach in presenting the price and\nvolume relationship on the chart, this emphasizes the relationship, with volume moving to the chart itself, where\nit joins price, rather than as an isolated indicator at the bottom of the chart. As a result, and with the change in\nthe X axis from time, to volume, the ‘time’ element is removed and the focus is then solely on the volume price\nrelationship.\nThis relationship is then presented in the form of ‘boxes’. The vertical element of the box, in other words the\nheight, is simply the high and low of the session in terms of price. The horizontal element is volume, which of\ncourse varies, as to whether this is ultra high, high, medium or low, which in turn means that the width of each\nbox varies. On our chart we no longer have candles, but a series of boxes, both narrow and fat, tall and short\nwhich then represent the direct relationship between volume and price in a very visual way, but with the time\nelement removed. The time element is still there, but on a separate axis below, otherwise it would be\nimpossible to know where we are on the chart.\nAs Arms himself said:\n‘if the market wore a wristwatch, it would be divided into shares, not hours’\nand indeed in some ways this sums up the concept of trading on tick based charts which I mentioned in an\nearlier chapter. After all, time is a man made concept, and something the markets can and do ignore. The\nbeauty of trading on a tick chart is that it is the market dictating the ‘speed’ of the market. In other words, on a\ntick chart, we are trading in harmony with the market. When we move to a time based chart, it is we who are\ndictating to the market our chosen timeframe, a subtle but important difference. On a tick chart we trade at the\nspeed of the market - on a time based chart we don’t.\nThis same philosophy can be applied to equivolume, which attempts to remove the rather ‘false’ aspect of time\nfrom the analysis, to create a purer and more meaningful relationship between the two elements of volume and\nprice.\nLet’s take a look at how these boxes are created and what they actually tell us about the volume price\nrelationship.

      "text": "Fig 12.10 Equivolume Boxes\nRemember, the X axis for each box is volume and the Y axis is price, so if we look at box 1, here we have a\nnarrow but tall box. In other words, the volume has been low, but the price action has been wide, so this might\nbe equivalent to a wide spread up candle on low volume, so an anomaly.\nNext to this in box 2, we have the opposite, where we have a small change in price, and remember we are\ntalking here about the high and the low, and NOT the open and the close, coupled with a large amount of\nvolume. This too might be equivalent to an anomaly where we have above average or high volume and a\nnarrow price spread.\nBox 3, might be considered representative of a ‘normal’ volume and price relationship, with good volume\nsupporting a solid price change. Finally in box 4, we have extremes of both volume and price. The box is wide,\nso above average volume and the price is wide as well, so clearly effort and result are in agreement here, as\nthey are in box 3.\nThe color of the boxes is dictated by the close. When the close is above the previous close, then the box is\npainted black, and when the close is below the previous close, then it is painted red.\nIn order to maintain aspect ratios and to keep the charts meaningful, the volume is then normalized by dividing\nthe actual volume for that period, by the total of all the volume displayed on the chart. Whilst time has been\nremoved from the boxes themselves, it still appears, to help keep the chart in context for the trading session.\nWhilst it is difficult to imagine trading using these boxes and moving away from candlesticks, many of the\ntechniques I have explained in this book will still apply, as they are equally valid. The focus using this approach\nis on the box, its shape, and location within any trend. Breakouts from congestion are just as important for\nequivolume trading as with more conventional VPA, and here we might expect to see what is often referred to\nas a “power box”, which is high volume and wide price. In VPA terms, above average volume and a wide\n",

      "text": "spread candle on the breakout from congestion. The principles are much the same, it’s the display which is very\ndifferent.\nAt this point let me add my own personal thoughts here.\nWhilst I like the concept of showing the price and volume together on one ‘box’ which instantly reveals whether\nwe have a high/low combination, anomalies, or an average/average combination which may be normal, the\nissue I have is the removal of time. After all, as Wykcoff himself stated, it is the cause and effect which holds the\nkey to the development of the trend. In other words, time is the third element of the volume and price\nrelationship. Remove time, and the approach becomes two dimensional, and not three dimensional, and as I\nhope I have made clear throughout the book, the longer a market is in a consolidation phase, then the greater\nwill be the consequent trend once the market breaks out. Consolidation phases are where trends are born or\npause before moving on, and if you remove the time element, then to me, this removes one of the pillars of\nVolume Price Analysis which is the judgment of the power of any subsequent trend.\nThis is just my own personal view, and I would encourage you to explore the idea of equivolume further for\nyourself. The other issue is that candlestick analysis no longer plays a part, but help is at hand here, with\ncandle volume charts.\nCandle Volume Charts\nCandle volume charts are exactly as they sound, and are a hybrid version of equivolume and traditional\ncandlestick charts. In other words, the ‘box’ of equivolume is then laid over a candlestick with the traditional\nopen, high, low and close, to create a unique chart. This charts displays candles of varying width and height\ndue to the volume aspect, but with the upper and lower wicks added. A combination of both approaches which\nis shown in the schematic below in Fig 12.11\nFig 12.11 Candlevolume Chart\n",

      "text": "A little more recognizable! On these charts the candles are now all different widths to reflect the volume on each\ncandle, with the price action represented vertically as usual, but with the open, high low and close displayed.\nOn this chart we see our traditional wicks to the top and bottom of each candle. This is not an approach I have\nstudied personally in any great detail, but it may have some advantages, and at least overcomes what I\nconsider to be one of the big drawbacks with equivolume, namely the lack of time, which I believe is\nfundamental to any VPA approach. However, I always keep an open mind, and if any readers of this book have\nused candlevolume and have found this system helpful, please do drop me a line and send me your thoughts\nand comments. You can never stop learning in trading!\nDelta Volume\nFinally just to round of this chapter on the ‘future’ for Volume Price Analysis, there are two further approaches to\nanalyzing volume which are gaining some traction, and these are delta volume and cumulative delta volume.\nIn simple terms delta volume refers to the difference in volumes between those contracts that trade at the ‘ask’\nand those that trade at the ‘bid’. In other words, orders that are sell orders and those that are buy orders, with the\nnet difference between the two then displayed as ‘delta’. For example, if the software calculates on one bar, that\nthere have been 500 contracts sold at the bid and only 200 contracts bought at the ask, then this would\nrepresent a net difference of 300 contracts sold. Any indicator measuring delta volume would then display this\nas a negative volume bar of -300 and generally these appear as shown in the schematic below in Fig 12.12\nFig 12.12 Delta Volume\nFrom this schematic the delta volume gives an indication of the net difference between the buying and the\nselling as the market moves higher and lower. In other words, yet another way of interpreting the volume and\nprice relationship. This approach is ideally suited to those markets where there is an open exchange, such as\nfor futures and equities.\nCumulative Delta Volume\nFinally cumulative delta volume collects all the delta data and adds each subsequent bar to that of the previous\nbar - summing the totals in other words, and then presents this as a series of bars, to provide a perspective on\n",

In other words, it attempts to give a perspective on the strength of the buying\nor selling associated with the price action.\nDelta and cumulative delta are relatively new in the world of Volume Price Analysis and as such, neither is\ngenerally available free as a standard indicator. This may change in the future, and as we move forward over\nthe next few years, I believe that delta and its derivatives may be increasingly adopted for certain markets. One\nmarket that springs to mind in particular is for E mini traders in indices, where it all started for me!\nI have now reached the end of the book. It is a book I have wanted to write for many years, and finally found the\ntime to do just that. I have tried to explain everything as carefully as I can, with what I hope are some clear\nexamples, and now it is for you to practise reading the charts and applying these techniques for yourself.\nI hope I have managed to convince you of the power of volume and price, and the potential success that awaits\nif you are prepared to adopt this methodology. It does require a little time to master but, in my opinion, is worth\nthe effort. However, I would urge you again, NOT to spend thousands of dollars on software which suggest that\nVPA can be done for you. It won't. VPA is a technique that takes time, effort and patience, but once you have\ngrasped the basic concepts then the rest falls into place very quickly.\nVolume and price together are the only indicators that truly reveal market sentiment and the activity of the\ninsiders. Without it you are trading blind. With it, everything is revealed. There is no hiding place with VPA.\nFinally, I would, of course, like to thank you for purchasing this book, and if you do have any comments,\nquestions or suggestions I would be delighted to hear from you. You can contact me on my personal email at\nanna@annacoulling.com and I guarantee that you will receive a reply. This book is based on my own personal\ntrading experience, and from what I found has worked for me over the years.\nIf you have enjoyed the book, naturally I would be grateful if you could spread the word, to help other traders\nwho may still be struggling to understand how and why the markets behave in the way they do. I would really\nappreciate a review on Amazon, which will help others to find this book more easily. So thank you in advance.\nThis is the first of several books that I will be publishing over the coming months. This is the second, and I have\nrecently published another entitled ‘A Three Dimensional Approach To Forex Trading which explains how to\nforecast forex market behavior using the combined power of relational, technical and fundamental analysis.\nThis will be followed by ‘A Simple Guide to Forex Trading Using MT4’. And I am also writing a book in\ncollaboration with my husband David ‘ A Complete Guide to Binary Options’, all of which you will be able to find\non my personal site at http://www.annacoulling.com\nFurther books are planned, as there are many aspects of trading (and investing) that I have not covered.\nOnce again, thank you so much, and may I wish you every success in your own trading journey towards\nbecoming a master forex trader.\nWarmest regards, and many thanks again\nAnna\nPS - please do follow my market analysis on my personal site and check for the latest book, or join me on\nTwitter or Facebook - In addition I also run regular seminars, webinars and trading rooms where I explain the\nconcepts and methodologies in more detail. I look forward to seeing you there, and thank you once again.\nhttp://www.annacoulling.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/annacoull\nhttp://facebook.com/learnforextrading\n",
