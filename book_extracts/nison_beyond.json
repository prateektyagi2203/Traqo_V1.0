The number of people who know the\nessentials of these charts are few and reference material is scarce. 111 This\npaucity of material was particularly true with some of the new techniques\nrevealed in the second part of this book. However, thanks to the help of\nsome important individuals, I was able to uncover many previously hid-\nden aspects of Japanese technical analysis.\nWithout the assistance of the translating done by Richard Solberg, it\nwould have been almost impossible to write this book-or my first one!\nNot only did Richard ably do the translating, but equally important was\nhis tenacity in finding and obtaining the Japanese books I needed for my\nbasic research. Richard has been one of my most vital resources.\nAs with my first book, I had the help of knowledgeable Japanese\ntraders who helped refine my knowledge by sharing valuable insights\nobtained from their years of experience.\nMr. Hiroshi Okamoto, Director at Nomura Investment Trust, Mr. Ya-\nsuhi Hayashi, Senior Trader at Sumitomo Life Insurance, Mr. Nori Ha-\nyashi, Investment Manager at Barclays Trust, and other members from\nthe Nippon Technical Analysts Association (NTAA) in Japan were all very\ngracious.

Mr. Inata's assistance was critical for the new tools\naddressed in this book; we spent many hours together. Not only did he\ntake his valuable time to review some of the new techniques to make\nsure I correctly understood the ideas, but he also took the extra step of\nconferring with his Japanese colleagues on points about which he was\nnot 100% sure. Mr. Inata said that he enjoyed our studying together. I\nthink he was being polite. Although I may have contributed to his knowl-\nedge in some respects, for the most part I was the student. I was fortunate\nto have had a gracious, knowledgeable, and friendly teacher.\nThanks again goes to my friend, Bruce Kamich. A true professional,\nhe continues to provide me with a stream of insightful and helpful ideas.\nThe editor of this book, Susan Barry, was also the editor of my first\nbook. Susan had the foresight to see how brightly the interest in the\ncandles would burn. She was a major factor in my choice of John Wiley\n& Sons to publish this book. I hope Susan does not decide to move to a\npublishing firm in the Antarctic. If I ever do a third book, I would have\nto follow her.\nAs an English poet said: \"Where ignorance is bliss, wisdom is folly.\"\nBefore writing my first book, I was blissfully ignorant of all the time and\neffort that goes into such a project. That book, made me aware of how\ndifficult the process is. Because of this, I had no desire to go through it\nall again. However, Dodge Dorland, Chief Investment Officer of Landor\nInvestment Management (New York, NY), gave me the push to do this\nsecond book. Dodge uses candles to trade stocks on an intra-day basis\nand has been one of the earliest proponents of candles. Anyone who has\ndealt with Dodge can vouch for his amiability and for his knowledge.\nMany of the charts in this book are from the MetaStock software by\nEQUIS International (Salt Lake City, UT). Without their assistance in\nproviding me with the new software to draw the kagi, three-line break,\nand renko charts, this book would be much less detailed. Their excellent\nsoftware, and helpful and knowledgeable staff makes MetaStock a plea-\nsure to use. For those interested in finding out more about the MetaStock\nsoftware, there is a coupon included at the back of this book. The data\nused for the Metastock charts was from Dial-Data (Brooklyn, NY). I found\ntheir data accurate and easily accessible.\nI would like to thank Shahrokh Nikkhah whose early appreciation of\nmy work and desire to make available the many advantages of candlestick\nanalysis to his clients brought about my joining his team where we offer\nadvisory and brokerage services at Daiwa Securities America.

A\nJapanese book that I had translated stated, ''It is not an exaggeration to\nsay that candlesticks are the best in the world and a very exquisite cre-\nation for charts.\"l This is because, as detailed below, candle charts open\nnew avenues of analysis and offer many advantages over bar charts:\n1. Candle charts will pictorially display the supply-demand situation by\nshowing who is winning the battle between the bulls and the bears.\nBar charts do not.\n2. Like bar charts, candle charts will show the trend of the market, but\ncandle charts add another dimension of analysis by revealing the force\nbehind the move.\n3. Bar chart techniques can often take weeks to transmit a reversal signal.\nHowever, candle charts will often send out clues of imminent reversals\nin one to three sessions. The result is that candle charts often provide\nthe opportunity for more timely trades.\nThese are just some reasons why the flames of interest in candle charts\ngrow ever brighter. In just a few years, candle charts have joined bar\ncharts and point and figure charts as a basic charting technique.\nCandle charts are drawn using the same data as bar charts (the open,\nhigh, low, and close), so they send all the same signals that can be found\non bar charts. Yet, as just discussed, the candles offer many advantages\nover bar charts, so using candle charts instead of bar charts is a win-win\nsituation.

So, why use a\nbar chart?\nBecause the Japanese are major players in most of the world's mar-\nkets, there is strong interest in how the Japanese use their technicals to\ntrade. Candles are the most popular form of technical analysis in Japan.\nThe importance of the candles for the Japanese trading community is\nillustrated in the following quote from the European magazine, Euroweek.\nThis article quotes an English trader who works at a Japanese bank. He\nstates: \"All the Japanese traders here-and that's in the foreign exchange,\nfutures and equities markets-use the candles. It might be difficult to\nwork out the billions of dollars traded in London on interpretations of\nthese charts each day, but the number would be significant.\"?\nThink about it: Although billions are traded every day based on the\ncandle chart signals, until recently we had no knowledge of how the\nJapanese viewed the market with their technicals. This is hard to believe.\nKnowing the candles and their other technical tools discussed in this\nbook may help answer the question, \"What are the Japanese going to do\nnext? \"\nYears ago, I met with the head of technical analysis for one of Japan's\nlargest life insurance companies (this Japanese trader wanted to meet\nwith me to learn how I used western technicals to trade). When he walked\ninto my office, he saw I had candle charts on my desk. In a surprised\nvoice, he asked: \"You know about the candles?\" I responded that I did.\nI then asked if he used them. He told me that his company's top man-\nagement would meet each Monday to discuss the world markets. At these\nmeetings, he would bring his candle charts to offer his technical views.\nThen he pointed to my candle charts and asked: \"How many other\nAmericans know about this?\" I said no one (this was before the publi-\ncation of my first book). He looked relieved. I then continued, \"But I\nwill soon have a book out about it.\" \"50, many others will know about\nthis?,\" he asked in a disappointed tone. The point of the story is that\nthe Japanese trader came to me to learn about how we, in the West, use\ntechnicals. The Japanese have learned from us and they know almost all\nof our technical methods. In most of the candlestick books and articles I\nhave had translated from Japanese to English, there was at least some\nreference to western technical techniques. A quote from one of the books\nI had translated stated, \"To understand stocks it is not enough to know\nthe Japanese chart methods ... one must absorb the best parts of western\ntechnicals: and on top of that using the best parts of Japanese charts to\nmake for a progressive outlook which is necessary for stock analysis.\"?\nWe can see from this statement how the Japanese have used our methods\nto enhance their own. One of the purposes of this book is to do the same\n",

They are older than Western point and figure and bar charts.\nAmazingly, candlestick charting techniques, used for generations in the\nFar East, were virtually unknown to the West until I revealed them in\nmy first book, Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques.\nI am pleased and proud that my first book has been credited with\nrevolutionizing technical analysis by igniting the flames of interest in the\ncandles. Before its publication, few people in the West had ever heard\nof a candle chart. Now, candle charting techniques are among the most\ndiscussed form of technical analysis in the world!\nInterest in candle charts has become so intense that the World Bank\nin Washington, DC asked me to address them on the subject.

Yet, within a short time, candle\ncharts have now joined these as a basic charting tool. The rapidity with\nwhich this has happened is a direct reflection of the candle's popularity\nand value.\nThe groundswell of interest in the candlestick charting has become a\ntopic in the media. A TV show, Tech Talk, on the business news cable\nstation CNBC is hosted by the famous technician, John Murphy. John\ntold me that a viewer once called and asked him, \"What are those charts\nthat look like hot dogs?\" What an interesting and amusing idea, I thought,\nto Americanize these charts by referring to them as hot dog charts. But\nI guess the term \"candle chart,\" thankfully, is here to stay.\nI have had many wonderful compliments from famous traders and\nanalysts. However, the most endearing compliment came from a woman\nwho wrote, \"If you ever have a down day, just remember there's a nice\nlittle grandmother in Missouri who's in awe of your accomplishments.\"\nThis letter, besides being so gracious, illustrates the universal appeal of\ncandles-from traders at the World Bank to a grandmother in Missouri.\nThe reason for the popularity of candlestick analysis is easy to un-\nderstand. They can be melded with any other form of technical analysis,\nthey are applicable to any of the markets to which technical analysis is\napplied, and they provide market insights not available anywhere else.\nWhy this book? A renowned 16th-century samurai swordsman stated\nthat \"learning is the gate, not the house. You first have to go through\nthe gate to get to the house.\"\nMy other book, Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques, took you\nto the gate. This book takes you to the house and has many new, excit-\ning, and effective techniques to improve your trading, investing, or\nhedging.\nJapanese charting was considered a secret. However, I have managed\nto pry open the \"secrets of the Orient\" by exchanging ideas with many\nJapanese traders who use candles and by having many hundreds of pages\ntranslated from Japanese into English. Lin Yutang, a noted Chinese phi-\nlosopher, sagely noted that one gets a different flavor from reading the\nsame book at different stages in life. Therefore, he says, all great books\ncan be read with profit and pleasure a second time; I have found this to\nbe true.\nIn the time since the publication of my first book, I have reread my\noriginal candlestick documents and have gleaned new insights.

I reveal these new and val-\nuable insights in this book.\nMy first book focused on the futures markets. The candles have now\nbecome so important that their popularity has spilled over from futures\ninto stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets from around the world.\nAs a result, this book will have many more of the charts than did my\nother book.\nAt times, a single candle line can be important. The Japanese have a\nsaying, ,'With the fall of one leaf we know that autumn has come to the\nworld.\" In this sense, a single candle line may be the first sign of a market\nturn. In this book, I will show how to use individual candle lines to obtain\nclues about the market's health.\nIt has been very exciting to see the intense interest sparked by the\ncandles. However, it is often forgotten that the emergence of a candle\npattern is but one aspect of trading. Other aspects, such as the risk and\nreward ratio of a potential trade and monitoring where the candle pattern\nappears in the overall technical picture, must also be considered. This is\nso important that I have devoted a chapter to these aspects.\nIn my continuing studies of Japanese trading techniques, I have un-\ncovered three charting methods that are very popular in Japan, yet are\nunknown to the West. These charting techniques are called three-line\nbreak charts, kagi charts, and renko charts. They are revealed in Part 2\nof this book.\nIn the days of fur trading in the United States, there was a company\ncalled the Hudson Bay Trading Company. They were known for taking\nrisks and for careful preparation. Trading journeys were undertaken with\nmuch excitement, but in case the fur traders forgot anything, they would\ncamp out the first night just a few miles away from the company's head-\nquarters. In other words, careful preparation spared the travelers poten-\ntial difficulties.\nIn Chapters 2 and 3, I too provide careful preparation by providing a\nprimer on basic candle theory and patterns. For those new to candle\ncharts, these chapters will provide the groundwork for your candle chart\nanalysis.\nMany of you are probably already familiar with the basics of candle\ncharts. With this in mind, Chapters 2 and 3 will also offer a deeper\nknowledge of the candles by revealing new candle theories, techniques,\nand tools. As a result, even those knowledgeable about candles will gain\nnew insights and perspectives into the power of the candle charts. For\nexample, when I describe the candle patterns in Chapter 3, I will provide\na unique visual glossary of candle patterns.

After you explore with me the beauty and power\nof the candle charts, you will never be able to go back to a bar chart.\nThis book will be a self-contained unit. I will not go over all the candle\npatterns; that is done in my first book. However, I will sometimes make\nreferences to the more obscure or rare patterns discussed in my first book.\nThis is for the benefit of those who are familiar with all the candle pat-\nterns. Do not worry if you have not heard of the pattern before; it will\nnot detract from the discussion of the chart.\nNumerous charts and exhibits will quickly and clearly make evident\nhow candles can enhance your trading, timing, and investing. As shown\nthroughout the book, candles can be merged with any other form of\ntechnical analysis. Consequently, I have included charts that show how\nto fully utilize the candles' power alone, or when joined with other tech-\nnical tools.\nJust as important as the recognition of candle patterns is an under-\nstanding of the relationship of the candle patterns to the overall technical\npicture. Chapter 4 focuses on this vital, but often neglected, aspect. In\nthis chapter, I will address how trading with the candles must take into\naccount the risk and reward of a potential trade, the stop-out level, and\nthe overall trend. I will also address the value of adapting to changing\nmarket conditions.\nBefore I discuss trading with candles, I want to clarify a few points.\nIn the futures market, selling short is as common as buying long. This is\nnot true in the stock market; most equity traders look to buy. Conse-\nquently, throughout this book when I use the term \"bearish\" or \"sell-\ning\" when discussing a stock, you should not think of necessarily going\nshort. Instead, view it as an area to protect existing longs by such means\nas selling covered calls, moving up protective stops, or offsetting all or\nsome longs.\nBut this book is about more than candles. In Part II I reveal the dis-\nparity index, the three-line break, renko charts, and kagi. These tech-\nniques, popular in Japan, are virtually unknown in the West and, unlike\ncandle charting, little has been written about these techniques, even in\nJapan.\nThe disparity index compares the close to a moving average. It is used\nin the same manner as dual moving averages, but it has an interesting\nwrinkle to it. The three-line break, kagi charts, and renko charts are\npopular among Japanese traders. They are excellent technical tools for\ndetermining the trend of the market.\nWhether you use the techniques discussed in this book individually\nor in combination with one another, you will discover that they provide\ndynamic advantages for those who make use of their tremendous poten-\ntial.\n",

Then in some of my translated material, it said something about\ncomparing successful trading to being like the three monkeys we all knew\nas children-see, hear, and speak no evil. Then it dawned on me; the\ntitle of the book, The Fountain of Gold-The Three Monkey Record of Money,\nmeans that for traders to get to their \"fountains of gold,\" they should\nhave the characteristics of these three monkeys. Specifically:\n1. \"See no evil\"-when you see a bullish (bearish) trend, do not get\ncaught up in it; consider it an opportunity to sell (buy).\nIn the Fountain of Gold, it states that there is always a rotation of Yang\n(bullishness) and Yin (bearishness). This means that within each bull\nmarket, there is a bear market, and within a bear market, there is a bull\nmarket. This view may explain why Japanese candlestick techniques place\nso much emphasis on reversal, rather than continuation, patterns.\n2. \"Hear no evil\"-when you hear bullish or bearish news, don't trade\non it.\nIt may be safer to take a position after you determine how the market\nreacts to a news item rather than initiating a trade when the news is\nreleased. Bernard Baruch, the millionaire stock speculator and presiden-\ntial advisor, stated that what is important in market fluctuations\"are not\nthe events themselves, but the human reactions to these events.\" Exhibit\n2.1 shows that how the market reacts to the news may be just as impor-\ntant as the news itself.\nThe Iraqi War started in the first few days of August 1990. Yet, Exhibit\n2.1 shows that gold stalled at $425. This $425level was gold's high earlier\nin 1990. This failure to take out the prior high was in spite of the fact\nthat there was a Mideast War. Gold's failure to rally on supposedly\nbullish news sent out volumes of information about the state of the mar-\nket. To wit, be careful of a market that fails to rally on bullish news. Note\nthat after this failure at $425, gold lost its luster as prices returned to their\npre-Mideast crisis price near $360 within two months.\nAlso be aware of what the Japanese refer to as \"whispering tactics.\"\nThis is what they call the spreading of false news to trick others in the\nmarket. Try to keep out of rumor buffeted markets. Isaac Newton once\nsaid, \"I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness\nof people.\" Why get involved with the madness of people?\n3. \"Speak no evil\"-don't speak to others about what you are going to\ndo in the market.\n",

Just as important, and something\nunique to Japanese charts, was that the relationship between the open\nand close was pictorially displayed. The top and bottom of the anchor's\nvertical line are the high and low of that session. The horizontal line of\nthe anchor line is the open. The arrow of the anchor line is the close.

Although they are shrouded in mystery, the candles\nprobably started in the early part of the Meiji period (from 1868). As can\nbe seen in Exhibit 2.2E, candle lines were a refinement of the anchor\nchart. The use of black and white real bodies made analyzing the un-\nderlying supply and demand situation visually easier to determine than\nwith the anchor charts.\nWith the arrival of the candle charts, Japanese technical analysis flow-\nered as people started thinking in terms of signals and trading strategies.\nPatterns were developed and market prediction became more important.\nTrying to forecast the market took on extra importance in the 1870s when\nthe Japanese stock market opened.\nAs can be seen from Exhibit 2.2, bar charts were one of the ancestors\nof the more evolved and productive candle charts. In essence, this means\nthat since most of the West is still using bar charts, it is also using a less\nevolved form of charting than the Japanese are with candle charts.\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE CANDLE LINE\nThe first step in using the power of candles is learning how to construct\nthe basic candle line. Exhibits 2.3. and 2.4 show that the candle line\nconsists of a rectangular section and two thin lines above or below this\nsection. We see why these are named candlestick charts; the individual\nlines often look like candles with their wicks. The rectangular part of the\ncandlestick line is called the real body. It represents the range between\nthe session's open and close. When the real body is black (e.g., filled in),\nit shows that the close of the session was lower than the open. If the real\nbody is white (that is, empty), it means the close was higher than the\nopen.\n~~~:'W-t,-/Hi9h\nClose\nOpen\nLower\n_\nShadow\n~\nLow\nWhite Real Body\nEXHIBIT 2.3.\nWhite Real Body\ni\n,-/Hi9h\n~h~~~w-,___Open\n.......---Close\nLower\n_\nShadow\n~\nLow\nBlack Real Body\nEXHIBIT 2.4.\nBlack Real Body\n",

      "text": "The Basics\n19\nThe thin lines above and below the real body are the shadows. The\nshadows represent the session's price extremes. The shadow above the\nreal body is referred to as the upper shadow and the shadow under the\nreal body is the lower shadow. Accordingly, the peak of the upper shadow\nis the high of the session and the bottom of the lower shadow is the low\nof the session.\nCandle charts can be used throughout the trading spectrum, from\ndaily, to weekly, and intra-day charting. For a daily chart, one would use\nthe open, high, low, and close of the session. For a weekly chart, the\ncandle would be composed of Monday's open, then the high and low of\nthe week, and Friday's close. On an intra-day basis, it would be the open,\nhigh, low, and close for the chosen time period (i.e., hourly).\nExhibit 2.3 shows a strong session in which the market opened near\nthe low and closed near its high. We know that the close is higher than\nthe open because of the white real body. Exhibit 2.4 illustrates a long\nblack candlestick. This is a bearish session in which the market opened\nnear its high and closed near its low.\nThe Japanese focus on the relationship between the open and close.\nThis makes sense; probably the two most important prices of the day are\nthe open and close. It is therefore surprising that American newspapers\nhave openings for futures prices, but not for stocks. A member of the\nNippon Technical Analysts Association told me that he found it unusual\nthat U.S. newspapers do not have opening stock prices; the Japanese\nhave the openings in their papers. He said that he did not know why\nthe Americans disregard the openings.\nI would expect that just as almost all technical software vendors now\ncarry candle charts, so it may be that as candles become more popular\nin the equity market, newspapers may, by popular request, carry stock\nopenings. Until then, in order to obtain the data needed to draw the\ncandles (the open, high, low, and close) you need to use a data vendor\nservice. These services furnish prices on disks or through modems. The\ndata supplied from a data vendor are then transferred into a technical\nanalysis software package that will draw the candles based on these\ndata.\nA note of caution: Some data vendors who do not have the actual\nopening price of a stock default to the prior session's close as today's\nopen. This, in my opinion, is not valid. You must have the true open to\ndraw an accurate candle line. Although an open on a stock will usually\nnot be much different from the prior close, there are some candle patterns\nin which a higher or lower opening (compared to the prior close) gives\nvaluable information. A data vendor that includes actual opens on stocks\nis Dial Data (Brooklyn, NY).\n",

      "text": "20\nCandles\nREAL BODY AND SHADOWS\nWhile an individual candle usually should not be used alone to place a\ntrade, the size and color of its real body and the length of its shadows\ncan provide a wealth of information. Specifically, looking at a line's real\nbody and shadows gives a sense of the supply and demand situation.\nThis section will discuss this basic idea, and explain how to use real\nbodies and shadows to get clues about the market's underlying strength\nor weakness. By using the candle lines discussed below, you may be able\nto get an early and tentative indication of market direction.\nTHE REAL BODY\nIn Japanese charts, even an individual candle line has meaning, and one\nof the first clues about the vitality of the market is to look at the size and\ncolor of the real body. To the Japanese, the real body is the essence of\nthe price movement. This is a critical and powerful aspect of candle charts;\nthrough the height and color of the real body, candle charts clearly and\nquickly display the relative posture of the bulls and the bears.\nThis section will be segmented according to the decreasing size of the\nreal bodies. The first part of this section will consequently focus on long\nwhite and then long black real bodies. After these, attention is turned to\ncandles with small real bodies called spinning tops. These diminutive\nreal bodies display a market where the bulls and bears are in a tug of\nwar.\nThis section will conclude with candles that have no real bodies. These\ncandles have the same (or nearly the same) opening and closing. Such\ncandles, called doji (pronounced do-gee), reflect a market in a state of\ntransition. Doji, as you will see later, can be an important market signal.\nLong White Real Bodies\nA long white real body is defined as a session that opens at or near the\nlow of session, and then closes at or near the session's high. The close\nshould be much higher than the open. For example, if a stock opens at\n$40 and closes at $40%, it would not be a long white candle since the\nopening and closing range were relatively close. For a long white candle\nto have meaning, some Japanese candlestick traders believe that the real\nbody should be at least three times as long as the previous day's real\nbody.\n",

It could, however, be one clue that the prior trend may\nbe changing. For instance, as shown in Exhibit 2.5, a long white real\nbody at a low price range may be the first sign of a market bottom. A\nlong white candle shows that the ability to rise is virtually unimpeded\nby the bears. The closer the close is to the high of the session, and the\nlonger the white real body, the more important the candle line.\nExhibit 2.6 shows that in late 1991, this stock was stabilizing near $5.\nThe first sign that the bulls were attempting to take control was the\nunusually long white real body at 1. Note how this real body was ex-\ntended compared to the prior real bodies. However, an almost equally\nlong, but black real body (for information on black real bodies, see page\n29), on the week after candle 1 showed that the bears still had enough\nforce to offset the bulls' advance. In early 1992, another unusually long\nwhite candle, shown at 2, appeared. This white candle opened on its low\n(since it does not have a lower shadow) and closed on its high (since it\ndoes not have an upper shadow). Such a candle is exceptionally strong,\nnotably when it is so elongated as in candle 2. Candle 3 was another\nstrong white candle that propelled prices to new multi-month highs. With\nthe tall white candles 1 and 2 both appearing near $5, we can see the\nsignificance of that $5 support area. Consequently, when prices corrected\nback to this level in July and August 1992, it is not surprising that the\nselloff stopped near $5.\nLong White Candle Confirms Support\nAs shown in Exhibit 2.7, the tall white candle that rebounds from support\nunderscores the aggressiveness of the bulls. A long white candle that\nbounces off a support area such as a trendline, a moving average, or a-\nretracement level gives extra confirmation of that support.\n",

I\nhave found this to be an excellent tool since it serves to alert traders to\nsupport zones that are not available with bar charts. The depth of the\nreaction should find support at either the middle of the long white real\nbody or the bottom of the entire white candle, including the lower\nshadow. The Japanese literature says that a long white real body should\nbe support in a rising market. However, based on my experience, it can\nalso be used as support in a falling market. The reason the market may\nfall back after an exceptionally tall white real body is that prices may\nbecome short-term overbought (that is, they rallied too far too fast). In\nthis scenario, the market may have to retrace some of the prior rally to\nrelieve this overbought condition.\nIn Exhibit 2.12, the huge white candle in early 1992 propelled prices\nfrom $10lJ2 to about $15.

The long black\nreal body should be significantly longer than the candles preceding it.\nThis is illustrated in Exhibit 2.16.

The first long black candle at the arrow stalled at\nthis resistance. With the retreat from this resistance through this un-\nusually long black real body, there was a cause for caution.

Using the theory of long candles, let us see how one could have\ntraded this market. A long white candle gives us a support area at 50%\nwithin its real body. Consequently, a pullback to near the 50% retrace-\nment of the long white could be used as an early buying zone. This could\nhave been at areas 1 through 4. Now, we turn our attention to a price\ntarget. Notice the exceptionally bearish long black real body from Sep-\ntember 1991 (at the arrow). As discussed above, we would expect a rally\nto stall as it approaches the top of this black candle. Although the bulls\nwere finally able to gather enough force to breach this resistance of the\nlong black candle, it took them over a year to accomplish this.

With more and larger black real bodies than white\nreal bodies, the candles tell us that the bears were taking a more aggres-\nsive stance than were the bulls. Classic Western technical theory stated\nthat after a congestion band, the market's trend should have resumed in\nthe same direction that it had before the congestion band. In this ex-\nample, the preceding trend was down. Thus, the bearish candle action\nduring the lateral range reinforced the classic Western theory and in-\ncreased the odds of a continuation of the preceding downtrend.\nIn the next section, using information on how the open compares to\nthe close will be discussed. But before that, I will discuss new ways of\ninterpreting candle patterns. This methodology will help illuminate the\ntheory and market action behind each candle pattern. Each candle pattern\nin this book will be illustrated four ways (refer to Exhibit 2.27).\nExhibit 2.27 (B) The blended candle-If the candle pattern has more\nthan one candle line, you can combine them to make a single candle line,\nwhich I call a blended candle. This method is sometimes used in the Jap-\nanese candlestick literature to help clarify whether a pattern is bullish or\nbearish. The blended candle is an individual line that is a combination\nof the open, high, low, and close of all the candle lines in the pattern.\n36\nCandles\n14: 15\nFIBO ( 0 of 2 )\nCLQ3 DAILY BAR\n< 1993 CQG IHC.\n0=\n1793\nH=\n1793··········.. ··················· .. ···················\n.\nt;-\nt!;~A~.\nnt6* ••I\ne._\n60LJI\n+\nU \"0 '*\n~ U\nt +~ ,r,c>:\n.•.\n.\n.. .\n.\n. ...\n.\n:\nI\n~+ ~l\n:\n'uuultll[o'Mt+,loru\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n.\n.\n.,.\n.\n:\n:\nt1\n,\n:\n.....u··· ..............................•.........................................•...····.u.. ·\n~DQlllflttt\n.\n.\n.\n.\n:\n.\n.\n.\n. :\n.\n.\n. .,.\n.\n,;.:uuuull'ht+'.....\n0=\n1793\n.\nH=\n1793\nL=\n1745\nC=\n1753\n:May\n:Jun\n:Ju1\n•\n112\n119\n126\n13\n110\n117\n124\n131\n17\n114\n121\n128\n15\n112\nEXHIBIT 2.26.\nRelative Size, Frequency, and Color of Real Bodies, August 1993\nCrude Oil\n2100\n2000\n1900\n1800\n",

Use the low of all the sessions of that pattern (i.e., the bottom of the\nlowest lower shadow) as the low of the blended candle.\n4.

This is because the blended candle shows the\nbearish aspects of a long upper shadow and small real body near the\nbottom of the range.\nExhibit 2.27 (C) Anchor charts-Those who draw the candle charts by\nhand and are tracking many markets or are restricted in time may find\nthis task to be burdensome. One way to circumvent this (besides buying\nsoftware) is to consider using anchor lines instead of candle lines. The\nanchor chart as previously discussed, is composed of the open, high,\nlow, and close. If the anchor is pointing up, it means that the close is\nhigher than the open (with the arrow part of the anchor representing the\nclose). An anchor pointing down means that the close is lower than the\nopen.\nAlthough the anchor chart is less visual than the candle chart, it pro-\nvides the same information and is faster to draw.

But you can draw up\nsessions in red and down sessions in black (remember, however, that\nunless you have a color printer, all the anchor lines will be black when\na hard copy is printed).\nExhibit 2.27 (D) Directional Pattern Analysis-To clarify the market's\npath that unfolds during the candle pattern, I will draw arrows reflecting\nthe market's basic intra-session action. I call this directional pattern analysis.\nThe path shown by the market's action in the directional pattern analysis'\ncan be used as a rough method to gauge the overall price action during\nthe session. Although the arrow in the directional pattern analysis will\nshow the path taken by the market during the session, it will not show\nthe order of when these prices where touched.\nFor example, based on the relationship of the real body and shadows\nof the first white candle in Exhibit 2.27 (A), we know that, at some time\nduring the session, prices moved under the opening price. However, we\ndo not know when the price moved under the open. While the arrow in\nExhibit 2.27 (D) may make it appear that the market immediately moved\nlower after the opening, it may not have unfolded that way. The market\ninstead may have rallied after the open and later in the session fell under\nthe opening price. Thus, it is important to keep in mind that the direc-\ntional pattern analysis should be thought of as a visual clue about the\nrelative price action of the open, high, low, and close compared to one\nanother. However, it does not tell us the sequence of that price action.\nOpening Compared to Prior Real Body\nA disadvantage of candle charts is that they require the close to complete\nthe candle line. There are some ways around this limitation. One method\nis to go to a shorter time. In other words, if you are looking at a daily\nchart, you can sometimes get a signal on the hourly chart before the close\nof the daily session. Another mechanism to bypass waiting for the close,\nand the one I will focus on here, is comparing the opening to the prior\nreal body.\nExhibit 2.28 (A) illustrates that if the opening is under the midpoint\nof the previous white real body, it could be a bearish scenario. Con-\nversely, if the next day's opening is above the black body's midpoint, as\nshown in Exhibit 2.28 (B), it could be viewed as a positive sign. This\nconcept might be useful for those who are more aggressive and risk-\noriented and would want to buy or sell on an opening rather than waiting\nfor a close.\nThis technique is more important for stocks than for futures.

But the stagnant prices during the\nsession show that the bears are unable to drag down prices. All that the\nbears have tried to sell has been accumulated by the bulls. After such a\nscenario, the bears may either run out of ammunition or just give up.\nThe consequence of either of these is a rally.\nDistribution is the opposite of accumulation. Distribution occurs when,\nat a high price level, there is heavy volume but virtually frozen prices.\nWhat is happening in such an environment is that the I'smart\"\nmoney\nis thought to be distributing their supply to meet all the buying that is\nentering the market. With distribution, the sellers are offering enough\nsupply to meet all the buyer's demand, thus keeping prices in check.\nDistribution should therefore be viewed as a topping scenario.\nNote that as part of the definition for either accumulation or distri-\nbution, there must be little price movement. A spinning top reflects a\nsession in which there is little price action (as defined by the difference\nbetween the open and the close).

As describe above, stag-\nnant prices and high volume at a low price level are classic signs of\naccumulation. The high-volume spinning top in this example shows that\nthe selling pressure was easily absorbed. This positive sign was further\nreinforced by the fact that this spinning top session made a new low for\nthe move, yet the bears were unable to maintain these new lows.\nIn Exhibit 2.34, June's tall white candle session was also a high-vol-\nume session. This was a very bullish development insofar as the market\nmoved up sharply with strong buying interest (as gauged by the high\nvolume). However, what occurred in the next session was cause for con-\ncern. In that session, a small real body (i.e., a spinning top) emerged.\nThe volume on the spinning top session (circled on the chart) was not\nas extreme as it was the prior day. Yet, looking back at the volume at\nthe bottom of the chart, we see that it was nonetheless a very high-\nvolume session compared to the prior periods. Consequently, there was\na high-volume spinning top session. What does that tell us?

Note\nhow the longest real bodies following the spinning top were black. This\nshowed that the bears had gained a foothold on the market.\nOne of the more important individual candlestick lines is the doji. As\nshown in Exhibit 2.35, a doji session has a horizontal line instead of a\nreal body. This is because a doji is formed when the session's open and\nclose are the same (or almost the same). If the market is trading laterallv,\na doji is neutral. In essence the doji is echoing, on a micro scale, the\nindecision reflected on a more macro scale by the market's sideways\naction. However, a doji that emerges after the mature part of an uptrend\nor sell-off has a greater chance of a market turn. At such a time, the\nJapanese say that a doji provides \"a hint of tops and bottoms.\"\nOne should be especially cautious about a doji that arises after a tall\nwhite candle which in turn appears after a significant uptrend. This is\ntrue whether the doji is within the prior long white real body or above\nit. Such action represents a disparity about the state of the market. Spe-\ncifically, the rally and tall white candles during such a rally tell us that\nthe bulls are still in charge. But a doji means that the bulls are failing to\nsustain the upside drive. This is shown in Exhibit 2.36.\nHow do you decide whether a near doji day (i.e., where the open\nand close are very close, but not exact) should be considered a doji? One\nmethod is to look at a near doji day and compare it to recent action. If\nthere is a series of very small real bodies, I would not view the near doji\nday as significant since so many other recent periods had small real bod-\nies or doji. (Other methods are covered in my first book).\nAs mentioned before, a doji is meaningful when it arises after a tall\nwhite candle during an uptrend.

However, if the highs of the doji session are exceeded,\nthen the market's uptrend should continue. This is discussed in more\ndetail below.\nA common mistake among those who use candtes is to use a doji as\nan outright buy or sell signal. This is not correct. The doji indicates, as\nthe Japanese say, \"a crossroads between the bulls and the bears.\" While\nthe doji can mean the market may reverse its prior trend, traders should\nview the doji as echoing a market in transition rather than being an\noutright reversal pattern. Based on this, traders should wait until the\nnext session or two after the doji to show them which way the market\nwill move.\nIf there is a doji during a rally, and if the market continues strong\nafter this doji, it is a bullish indication since the market has resolved itself\nfrom the state of transition (as shown by the doji) to its new trend-Up.\nThus, while a doji that appears after a rally could be an indication of a\nreversal (since the market is at a crossroads), it is best to wait for bearish\nconfirmation over the next day or two to get a top reversal confirmation.\nFor those who sell on a doji, the doji should act as resistance (see Exhibit\n2.37). If the market closes above the high of the doji, the Japanese say\nthe market has become \"refreshed.\" Based on this, a buy stop should\nbe placed above the high of the doji. The opposite would be true with a\ndoji in a downtrend. To wit, a doji in a downtrend shows that the market\nis at a point of indecision, and a white candle after such a doji shows\nthat the market has resolved itself to the bull side. A buy based on the\ndoji after a downtrend should have a sell stop under the doji's low (in-\ncluding the lower shadow). This is because such a scenario is viewed as\na bearish continuation signal.\nOne of the most fascinating aspects about candle charts is that, in\nspite of their underlying simplicity, they provide so much valuable in-\nformation about the state of the market.

That simple, individual\ncandle line relays how a market is in a state of balance between the bulls\nand bears. As a result, the market may be at a transition point. All this\ninformation in one candle line!\nAn important aspect about doji (the plural of doji is also doji) is that\ntraders should look at where the doji appears in a trend. Exhibit 2.38\nshows a doji in relation to the trend. As in Exhibit 2.38(A), the appearance\nof a doji after a steep advance or in an overbought market could be a\ntop. However, as shown in Exhibit 2.38(B), if the market just started to\nrise, it indicates there is less of a chance that the market is at a top. In\nExhibit 2.38(C) we see how the emergence of a doji after a precipitous\ndecline could mean a bottom. Exhibit 2.38(D) displays a market that has\njust begun to fall. In this scenario, prices may continue their descent even\nafter a doji. The main concept behind Exhibit 2.38 is that doji become\nmore important as a reversal signal the more overbought or oversold the\nmarket.\nIn Exhibit 2.39, we notice a rally that started in early November stalled\nafter two doji following a tall white candle. The appearance of these doji\ntold of a market in which the bulls and bears were in equilibrium. This\nwas very different from the prior session when the tall white candle\ndisplayed a vibrant and healthy market in which the bulls were in control.\nThese doji were showing, as the Japanese would phrase it, that \"the\nmarket is separating from its trend.\"\nAs discussed before, doji become resistance. In this chart, there is also\na long black real body candle (at the arrow) a few days after the doji.\nThis black real body should also be resistance.

This doji is\nknown as a gravestone doji. A gravestone doji looks like a wooden me-\nmorial used in Buddhist funerals that is placed at a gravestone.

      "text": "The Patterns\n57\nAn aspect of the hammer is that it must appear after a significant\ndownturn or in an oversold market to have significance. The hammer is\na reversal indicator, and as such, should have a downtrend to reverse.\nA hammer that appears after a fall of, say, two or three days is usually\nnot important. Since the hammer is most useful after a significant down-\nturn, it should be noted that there may be selling on a rally from the\nhammer. As such, the first bounce from the hammer may fail and the\nmarket may return to test the hammer's support.\nConsequently, trading with the appearance of a hammer depends on\na trader's aggressiveness and risk adversity. Some traders may decide to\nbuy immediately after the hammer appears in case the market does not\npull back to retest the hammer. Some traders may decide to wait to see\nif the market returns to the hammer, and if so, will buy on that return\nmove. If the market successfully tests the hammer's support area, there\nis then a more solid support area and a better chance for a rally. A method\nthat I sometimes recommend to our clients is to lightly test the waters\nfrom the long side after a hammer, and then add the remainder of the\nlong position after (and if) there is a successful test of the hammer.\nWhichever methodology is used, a stop (based on the close) could be\nplaced under the lows of the hammer.\nExhibit 3.2 displays a classic hammer in that the extreme length of\nthe lower shadow reflects how aggressively the bulls were able to propel\nprices off the lows of the session. The bounce from this hammer stalled\nduring the next few sessions. But the pullback held the hammer's sup-\nport. This action helped enlarge the base upon which to build a more\nsubstantial rally.\nA trading tool that I find useful with candles is a Western technique\ncalled a spring. As shown in Exhibit 3.3, a spring occurs when the bears\nare unable to hold prices under a broken support area. Because such\naction proves that the bears were unable to grab control of the market\nwhen they had their chance, it should be viewed as a bullish develop-\nment. The opposite of a spring is an upthrust. An upthrust occurs when\nthe market makes a new high, but then fails to hold that high. Upthrusts\nwill be addressed in the section titled \"The Shooting Star\" later in this\nchapter. (Springs and upthrusts are described in detail in my first book.)\nAn ancient oriental book on military tactics referred to gaining an\nadvantage over the enemy by acting as a \"moving shadow.\" This term,\nas used by the warrior who wrote that book, means that when you cannot\nsee the state of your opponent, you pretend to make a powerful attack\nto uncover the intention of the enemy. This concept, as related to trading,\nis one of the reasons a spring is so important.\nProbes of support or resistance areas are attempted throughout the\nmarkets by large-scale traders.

In this context, it is interesting that\nthe Japanese have two words for rice. They call it either \"raisu\" or \"go-\nhan.\" Raisu is the Japanese term for rice when it is prepared Western\nstyle. The term \"raisu\" even sounds like the Western word \"rice.\" Go-\nhan also means rice, but it is rice prepared Japanese style. In other words,\nthe Japanese refer to the exact same product-rice-by different names.\nWhat surrounds the rice determines whether the rice is referred to as\nraisu or gohan. So it is with the hammer and hanging man. Whether the\ncandle line is a bullish pattern (the hammer) or a bearish pattern (the\nhanging man) is dependent on what precedes the line.\nWith the hanging man's long lower shadow reflecting buying interest,\nit may seem that the hanging man is a bullish signal. However, the\nhangman's action shows that once the market has fallen, it has become\nvery fragile. The small real body of the hanging man also shows that the\nprior uptrend may be in the process of changing. Because of the bullish\naction of the hanging man session (during the session the market sells\noff and then rallies by the close), an important aspect of the hanging man\nlines is that there should be bearish confirmation. A common method of\nbearish confirmation of a hangman is to wait to see if the next session's\nclose is under the hanging man's real body. This is shown in Exhibit 3.5.\nThe reason for the importance of this confirmation has to do with the\nfact that the hanging man's long lower shadow shows that there is still\nrising power left in the market. However, if prices fall under the hanging\nman's real body, it translates into the fact that everyone who bought at\nthe open or close of the hanging man session is now losing money. In\nsuch a scenario, these longs may decide to liquidate, and by doing so,\nmay engender a further weakening of prices.\nSince my seminar on the candles at the World Bank in Washington,\n",

One of their traders asked what I thought about the\nchart of the German Bund shown in Exhibit 3.6. She asked my opinion\non April 10 after the hanging man was formed. I explained to her that if\nthe hanging man were confirmed by a weaker session the next day, the\noutlook would be bearish. In this case, the market confirmed the bearish\nhanging man during the next session.\nExhibit 3.7 shows how important it is to wait for confirmation of a\nhanging man session. In that chart, we see a hanging man. However,\nnote how the following week the bulls pushed prices above the high of\nthe hanging man. This means that those who bought during the hanging\nman session now have a profit. Consequently, there is little reason for\nthem to liquidate their longs. The result is that a higher close than the\nhanging man session voids any of the bearish potential of the hanging\nman. That is what happened here as the market exceeded the hanging\nman session. Also of interest in this chart is that in April 1992, there was\na hammer that was also a bullish spring, since the hammer made a new\nlow which failed to hold.\nAn article about my work with candles in The Wall Street Journal dis-\nplayed the chart shown in Exhibit 3.8. In this article, I discussed how the\nhanging man at $40 helped confirm a top. I explained that before the\n1990 Mid-east crisis, the highest crude oil futures reached was around\n$32 (crude oil futures began trading in 1983). Once the market exceeded\nthat level, I had a target at around $40. That was a resistance area in the\ncash market back in 1979. Note that at the $40 area, there was a bearish\ncandle signal via the hanging man line. The market retreated from this\n$40 level and tested a support line.

This is what unfolded as this $20 resistance area was\nconfirmed with the mid-December hanging man session. The long black\nreal body, also near $20, on December 28, showed that the bears had\ntaken control.\nThe Shooting Star\nA session with a long upper shadow and a small real body near the\nbottom end of the trading range is called a shooting star(see Exhibit 3.11).\nJust as the long lower shadow of a hammer is bullish, so the long upper\nshadow of the shooting star is bearish. The long upper shadow means\nthat the bears have been able to sharply drag prices back from their highs.\nIn Exhibit 3.12, we see how the mid-August shooting star's long upper\nshadow reflected the aggressiveness of the bears. Following this shooting\nstar, another symptom of market uncertainty came with the high-wave\ncandle. The fact that the shooting star and the high-wave candle both\nappeared near the psychologically important 100 area reinforced the im-\nportance of those signals.\nIn Exhibit 3.13, I show how a support area from late August (marked'\nS) changed to resistance through September and into October. The Oc-\ntober failure of this resistance area was via a shooting star. The long upper\nshadow of this line reflected the heaviness of supply towards the 1.66\nlevel. Another attempt to breach 1.66 failed in early October with a long\nblack real body.\nIn the section on hammers, I discussed the concept of springs (when\nthe price springs back above a broken support area) and that the opposite\nof a spring is an upthrust. As shown in Exhibit 3.14, an upthrust is\ncreated when prices break above a resistance area, but then retreat back\nunder the previously broken resistance.

In other words, the dark cloud cover displays pictorially\na time in the market in which selling pressure is exceeding the buying\npressure.\nAn ideal dark cloud cover's second session should close under the\nmidpoint of the prior white candle. If the black candle does not close\nbelow the halfway point, it is considered by some Japanese traders to be\nan incomplete dark cloud cover. In such cases, it is best to wait for con-\nfirmation during the next session in the form of a weaker close. As a\ngeneral rule, the deeper the close of the dark cloud cover's second session\npushes into the white candle, the more bearish the signal.\nA dark cloud that fails to move under the center of the prior candle\nis shown in Exhibit 3.18.

This\nmeans the dark cloud cover in Exhibit 3.18 may be less bearish than a\nstandard dark cloud cover. This is why there should be confirmation by\nfurther weakness after the type of dark cloud cover shown in Exhibit\n3.18.\nThere is a difference in how I would view the dark cloud cover in\nstocks and futures. The ideal dark cloud cover has the second session's\nopen above the high of the prior session. Since there is generally higher\nprice volatility in the futures market as compared to stocks, it means that\nI am more flexible about the definition of a dark cloud cover with stocks\nthan with futures. Specifically, with stocks I still view it as a dark cloud\ncover if the second session opens above the prior session's close, rather\nthan its high.

In Exhibit 3.20, we see\na dark cloud cover in late January near $75.50. The market retreated from\nthere until a hammer (that was also a spring) formed near $69 in Feb-\nruary. The rally from this hammer stalled in March at the resistance set\nby the dark cloud.

In this example, once prices broke under the bottom\nend of the early November congestion band, those who went short while\nthe market was within the lateral band were making a profit on the\ndownside breakout. However, those who went long while the market\nwas within that early November trading band were in a losing trade when\nprices broke under the bottom end of the congestion band. This means\nthat if the market rallies back up to the congestion band, those longs may\nuse that rally to try to get out of their losing trade. In other words, the\nexisting longs should be new sellers on rebounds to the congestion band.\nIn Exhibit 3.22, once the early November congestion area was broken, it\nthen became resistance. The December failure at that resistance area came\nwith the dark cloud cover (the empty area between the two candles of\nthe pattern was due to a holiday).\n",

Part of the reason may have to do with an old\nWall Street saying, \"In on greed, out on fear.\" Although both greed and\nfear are strong emotions, I think many would agree that of the two, fear\nis the one that could cause the most volatile markets. During market\nbottoms, traders or investors usually have the opportunity to wait for an\nopportunity to enter the market. They may bide their time and wait for\na pullback or for the market to build a base, or to see how the market\nreacts to news. Fear is more prevalent at tops. Fear is saying, \"I want\nout-now!\"\nIn Exhibit 3.25 we see that an advance that started in late 1991 stalled\nat the doji following the tall white candle. The extended upper shadow\nin May echoed the importance of the resistance area set by this doji. The\nmarket then retreated until August's piercing pattern. The piercing pat-\ntern was also at a support area based on a 50% retracement of the rally\nfrom the December low to the May high. The 50% retracement area should\nbe closely monitored by traders because such retracements are widely\nwatched by technicians. This pattern became support that was held in\nOctober with a high-wave candle. The rally from this base near $33 stalled\nat another doji following a tall white candle in early 1993.\nExhibit 3.26 displays that April's piercing pattern confirmed a support\n",

Another piercing pattern in\nlate May and early June signaled a temporary base for another assault at\nMay's resistance area near $4.15. A series of two hanging man lines\nappeared at that resistance. Note how the first hanging man was not\nconfirmed (since the next session did not have a lower case). Only on\nthe day after the second hanging man session, with its close under the\nsecond hanging man's real body, was the hanging man line confirmed.\nThe Engulfing Patterns\nAn engulfing pattern is a two candle pattern. A bullish engulfing pattern\n(shown in Exhibit 3.27A) is formed when, during a downtrend, a white\nreal body wraps around a black real body. A bearish engulfing pattern\n(Exhibit 3.27B) is completed when, during a rally, a black real body en-\nvelops a white real body.\nThe engulfing pattern visually shows how the opposing forces had\ngained control of the market. For example, a bullish engulfing pattern\nreflects how the bulls have wrested control of the market from the bears.\nA bearish engulfing pattern shows how a superior force of supply has\noverwhelmed the bulls. The Japanese say that with a bearish engulfing\npattern, \"the bulls are immobilized.\" We previously saw how with the\ndark cloud cover, the bears were able to move prices into the prior white\nreal body, but with the bearish engulfing patterns, the power of the bears\nwas such that they were able to pull the close under the entire prior\nwhite real body. The same concept can be used to compare a piercing\npattern to a bullish engulfing pattern. With the piercing pattern, the bulls\ncounterattack strongly enough to push the close of the second white real\nbody well into the prior black real body. However, with the bullish en-\ngulfing pattern, the bulls' strength is that much greater since the close\nof the white candle session is above the top of the prior black real body.\nAlthough this generally means that the bearish engulfing pattern is more\nbearish than a dark cloud cover, and a bullish engulfing pattern more\nbullish than a piercing pattern, it is equally important to see where these\npatterns emerge before deciding which is more important. For instance,\na piercing pattern that confirms a major support area should be viewed\nmore likely as a bottom reversal signal than a bullish engulfing pattern\nthat does not confirm support. This vital aspect of viewing the candle\npatterns in conjunction with the overall technical picture will be discussed\nin depth in the next chapter.\nThe basic definition of an engulfing pattern is that the second real\nbody must engulf an opposite color real body. However, not all engulfing\npatterns are equally important. The importance of the engulfing pattern\n",

Specifically, I still view it as an engulfing pattern if the\nopen of the second session of the candle pattern is the same as the close\nof the first candle. This is shown in Exhibit 3.31.\nExhibit 3.32 shows an example of a bullish engulfing pattern in which\nthe open and the close were about the same.

The diminutive size of the first small body of a bearish engulfing\npattern shows that the momentum of the prior rally is slackening.

However, after a downtrend,\na white-black (meaning the first candle is white and the second is black)\nor a white-white harami is viewed more bullishly than a black-white or\na black-black harami. This is because a long white candle is by itself\nviewed as bullish, so its appearance in a harami increases the chance that\nthe falling power of the market will come to an end.\nThe same rationale applies to a harami after an uptrend. As displayed\nin Exhibit 3.39(B), a harami with a long black real body can be viewed as\nmore bearish than a harami in an uptrend that has a long white real\nbody. This is because a long black real body after a rally is construed as\nbearish, so when it is the first part of the harami pattern, the degree of\npessimism is increased.\nOther aspects that will increase the importance of a harami include\nthe following.\n1.

The\nOctober harami pattern was more important because of the extremely\nshort real body. Its small size made it like a doji session. Thus, October's\nharami could be viewed as a harami cross.

That is, for a rising window, the top\nof yesterday's upper shadow should be under the low of the today's\nlower shadow. A falling window means that the low of yesterday's ses-\nsion (i.e., the bottom of the lower shadow) is above the top of today's\nupper shadow. Windows are a good visual clue because they clearly\ndisplay that the action and market sentiment is so one-sided.\nIn a talk I gave before a group of traders, I mentioned how, based on\nmy experiences, the window was a candle tool that I have found to work\nwell. After I mentioned this, a trader in the audience told me that he\nused to work at a Japanese bank. After my explanation of the importance\nof windows, he said that he then understood why the Japanese traders\nat the bank would routinely go to the charts looking for gaps-sometimes\neven going back years to find one.

Thus, after a rising\nwindow, which is a bullish continuation pattern, the prior uptrend should\ncontinue. A falling window has bearish implications since it means the\nprior trend, in that case down, should resume.\nThere is a saying used in Japan about windows, \"The reaction will\ngo until the window.\" In other words, the window should be the limit\non a reaction. Thus, for a rising window, reactions (i.e., selloffs) should\nstop within the window. For a falling window, rebounds (i.e., rallies)\nshould stop within the window.\nWhen using windows as support and resistance, it should be noted\nthat the price may fall below the bottom of a rising window or above the\ntop of a falling window temporarily before prices move back in the di-\nrection of the window. This is illustrated in Exhibit 3.45(A) and (B).\nA general rule that I have found useful based on my experience is\nthat if the price closes through the window, I then view the prior trend\nas being voided. For example, if there is a rising window between $83\nand $85 and then the market closes under the bottom of the window\n(i.e., under $83), the uptrend can be considered as over.

Namely, that an individual candle\npattern should be viewed in the context of the surrounding technical\npicture. In this example, a shooting star viewed in isolation (that is, by\nnot looking at the window preceding it) could have caused a poorly\npositioned trade.\nWhen I show Exhibit 3.50 at my seminar, I title it, \"Saved by the\nLight of the Candles!.\" This is because the chart is an example of how\ncandles can help avoid a bad trade. In mid-March, the market closed\nabove a major resistance line that went back to December 1991 (only the\nlast part of this resistance line is shown on the chart). This breakout action\ncould have been viewed as potentially bullish. However, there was still\na lack of confirmation based on the candles. Specifically, there was an\nopen window in early March that was yet unclosed. Based on candle\nprinciples, until the market closes above the top of the window (in this\ncase at $1088), the trend was still down.

This is because the\ndoji could be a sign of a tired market and if a white candle followed this\ndoji it would show that the market would then be refreshed.\nAs discussed in the section on doji, a doji after an uptrend or a tall\nwhite candle could be potentially bearish. However, I would view the\nfact that if a doji gaps higher, some of the potentially bearish implications\nof the doji are negated because the rising window shows the underlying\nstrength of the market.\nAs shown in Exhibit 3.61, the doji at session 1 did not gap lower (that\nis, the high of doji session 1 was above the low of the prior session).\nBecause of this, doji 1 is not a classic gapping doji, although the market\ncame so close to opening a falling window with doji 1 that I still viewed\nit as a gapping doji. Interestingly, the next session (at doji 2) the market\ndid form a gapping doji.

This is because, after the second candle line, all we known\nabout the market is that it went from an uptrend to period in which the\nbulls and bears were in a stalemate as gauged by the small real body of\nthis second candle. It is only after the long black candle moves into the\nfirst session's white body that we get the proof that the bears have taken\ncontrol of the market.\nExhibit 3.64 is an example of how an evening star confirmed a resis-\ntance area set up by a bearish engulfing pattern. Because this bearish\nengulfing pattern and evening star arose near the same area, both pat-\nterns formed a potential double top near $45. In Western technicals, a\ndouble top is confirmed by a move under the low between the two price\npeaks that make up the double top. In this chart, this low was made in\nFebruary at $40!. A double top gives a measure derived on the range\nfrom the highs to the low of the pattern. In this case, there was about a\n$5 range that is subtracted from the February low of $40!. This gave a\ntarget to about $35!.

This was their response: \"We have found our\ndiscussions very interesting in the sense that you try to be very specific\nin determining definitions of Japanese exhibit readings while we try to\nkeep them flexible so as not to exclude all possibilities.

How do you determine if you should trade from a\nless than ideal pattern? Based on the Japanese literature, may conversa-\ntions with Japanese candle traders, and my experience, here are a few\nsuggestions:\n1. Wait for more confirmation of that pattern's prediction. For example,\nan ideal dark cloud cover should have the second session's close more\nthan halfway into the first candle's white real body. If the close is less\nthan halfway into the white real body, then wait until the next session\nto see if the market remains weak.\n2. If the less than ideal pattern confirms a support or resistance area, or\nif it appears in a very oversold or overbought market, the greater the\nodds that the pattern will be a reversal. For example, if there is a\nhammer in which the lower shadow is not very long, but if this \"ham-\nmer-like\" line confirmed a 50% retracement area, I would view such\naction as having all the bullish import as would a more traditional\nhammer.\n3. A method you may find useful in helping to determine the significance\nof a less than ideal pattern is to make a blended candle from that\npattern. Then see if the blended candle confirms the pattern's forecast.\nFor example, look at Exhibit 3.75 (GM) previously discussed. I used\nthis chart to draw the blended candles from morning star variations\nM1 and M2. Notice how each of these blended candles had long lower\nshadows. The long lower shadows of both of the blended candles and\nthe fact that both M1 and M2 emerged near the same support with the\nlong white candle following M2 gave clues that the bears were losing\ncontrol of this market.\nRECORD SESSIONS\nMost candle patterns are composed of one, two, or three candles. This\naspect shows one of the major advantages of the candle charts-they can\noften send a reversal signal in only a few sessions, whereas bar charts\ncan take much longer. Although some candle patterns do take longer to\nunfold, they are nonetheless extremely valuable. One of these longer\nterm pattern techniques is the eight to ten record sessions.\nWhen a candle session makes a higher high, the Japanese call it a\n",

The session that makes a lower low then becomes record\nsession 1. The next lower low then becomes record session 2.\nThe theory of record high sessions is that during a rally, a trader\nshould stop buying after eight to ten record session highs (or liquidate\nlongs, or sell short with the appearance of a bearish candle signal after\nthese record session highs). The same philosophy, but in reverse, should\nbe considered after a decline with eight to ten record session lows. To\nwit, a trader should stop selling after about eight record session lows (or\ncover shorts, or buy looking for a bounce with a bullish candle signal\nafter eight or more record session lows).\nThe record session count need not be consecutive. A few sessions of\nconsolidation can be ignored when counting the new highs or lows.\nGenerally, there should not be more than two or three sessions of side-\nways action between the record sessions, nor should there be a sharp\nmove counter to the record session trend.\nThe reason that record sessions should be almost consecutive has to\ndo with the underlying concept of record sessions. In the case of eight-\nten record session highs (lows), the market becomes overbought (over-\nsold). In an overbought (oversold) situation, the market becomes vul-\nnerable to a price dip (rally) as those who are currently long (short) may\ndecide to take their profits.\nThe market can relieve an overbought or oversold situation in one of\ntwo ways-by trading laterally or by experiencing a sharp price correc-\ntion. If the market corrects the overbought or oversold situation by either\nof these methods, the record session count is no longer valid since the\nmarket is no longer overextended, and thus is less vulnerable to a cor-\nrection. For example, in Exhibit 3.76(B), observe how the market got to\nrecord session high 5, then quickly sold off for three sessions. Because\nof the extent of the selloff during these three sessions, the market relieved\nits overbought condition. As shown, a new count is then started after\nlow 2.\nDo not be too concerned with the specific number of record sessions.\nThe eight to ten record session rule is a guidepost. Each market has its\nown personality. Just as those who follow cycles may find that different\nmarkets have different cycles, so some markets may correct after six or\ntwelve record session instead of the more normal eight-ten sessions.\nIn Exhibit 3.77, from the low at X, we start the record session high\ncount at the next candle since it made a higher high. After record session\n8, the market formed two doji. These doji reflected a market that is tiring.\nFor those who were looking for a reason to exit longs, these doji and the\n",

This picturesque saying (using the typical military analogy\nso common in Japanese technical analysis) means that you must consider\nthe overall market condition before trading with the candles. Otherwise,\nyou may be in for a \"loss and ambush encounter.\"\nA member of the Nippon Technical Analysts Association wrote to me\nthat he views the overall technical picture as more important than an\nindividual candle pattern.

Effective\ncandle charting techniques require not only an understanding of the can-\ndle patterns, but a policy of using sound, coherent trading strategies and\ntactics. It is unfortunate that some traders who know about the candle\npatterns often ignore such tactics. The candles are a tool that must be\nincorporated with other trading guidelines. In this sense, I have always\nviewed the candles as being another color, albeit an important one, on\nmy technical palette.\nA disciple of Confucius once asked him who would he take to war\nwith him.

By understanding and using these trading prin-\nciples, you will be in a position to most fully enhance the power of the\ncandles. By the end of this chapter, you should understand that what\nemerges before and after a candle pattern is a critical element of trading.\nSTOPS\n\"Even Monkeys Fall from Trees\"\nThere should always be a price at which you say your outlook is wrong.\nThe protective stop out level is that price. No matter how reliable the\n\\etn:n\\ta\\ \\QQ\\, \\nete Wll.\\'oe \\\\mes wnen \\ne signal ob\\ainea. trom \\n.a\\ \\00\\\nis wrong. By using stops, you are defining the risk of a trade. In effect,\nthe use of stops provides one of the most powerful aspects of technical\nanalysis; it offers a risk management approach to the market.\nMany of the candlestick patterns can become a support or resistance\narea. For example, a dark cloud cover often acts as resistance. As such,\nfor those who are short, a protective buy stop can be placed on a close\nabove the high of the dark cloud cover. In Exhibit 4.1, we see that an\nuptrend that started in early January stopped via a dark cloud cover as\nthe market went from an uptrend preceding this pattern into a lateral\nband after the dark cloud. The dark cloud cover acted as resistance for\nthe next 7 sessions. But the rising window and then the close above the\nhigh of the dark cloud cover were signs that the market was ready to\nonce again advance.\nIt is human nature that when price action turns against you, wishful\nthinking enters the picture. For instance, after the market pushed above\nthe stop out level in Exhibit 4.1 (the high of the dark cloud cover), some\ntraders who were short may have hoped that the market would then turn\naround and decline. But in the market, there is no room for hope. Staying\nin a market that moves through a stop out level in the hope that prices\nwill then turn is, as a picturesque Japanese proverb states: \"To lean a\nladder against the clouds.\"\nIn Exhibit 4.2, we see that a rising window emerged in April 1993.\nBased on candle theory, this window should be support, as it was during\nthe September 1993 pullback.

This break of the window\ncould have been another protective sell stop signal for existing longs.\nRISK/REWARD\n,'The Side that Knows When to Fight and When Not to Will Take the\nVictory\"\nI often find that, after my seminars, people in the audience are so excited\nabout the new ''light\" offered by the candles that they cannot wait to\nget back to their offices or homes to place a trade based on a candle\npattern. However, as one of the books that I had translated stated (a\ntrader must) \"wait for time to ripen, waiting for just the right moment\nis virtuous, a patient mind or spirit is essential. ,,2 In other words, just\nbecause there is a candle pattern, it does not mean that the\" time is ripe\"\nfor a trade. I try to warn my audiences that one of the most important\naspects in determining the \"right moment\" for a trade is to inspect the\nrisk/reward aspect of the market at the time the candle pattern is formed.\nIn this context, a trader who was in an institutional trading group for\nwhom I gave a special seminar wrote to me that, \"You were certainly\ncorrect-a little knowledge can be dangerous. We're all running around\nthe office shouting 'Doji, Doji.'\"\nA stop, by defining the risk of a trade, is one of the components of\nthe risk and reward picture. The other component is the price target of\nthe trade, or the potential \"reward.\" There are many ways to determine\nprice targets, from Elliott Wave to previous support or resistance areas.\nBecause candle charting techniques usually do not provide a price target,\nI often recommend the joining of Western technicals with candles. The\ncandles are excellent for sending a reversal or a continuation signal, while\nthe Western tools, such as retracements or trend lines, can help provide\na price target. You probably already have your own methodology to\nobtain price targets.\nA key point to remember is that unless there is an attractive risk/\nreward ratio at the time the candle pattern is completed, stay away from\nthe trade. As a Japanese proverb says, \"His potential is that of the fully\ndrawn bow-his timing the release of the trigger.\" The timing of the\n\"release of the trigger\" depends on the risk/reward aspect of the trade.\nThere will be times when you should not release the trigger.

With this window as a target, the appearance of the\nbearish engulfing pattern made for an attractive short sale because of the\nrelatively low risk stop as compared to the target.\nIn Exhibit 4.5, we see that a rally that started with a bullish engulfing\npattern in January formed a rising window later that month.

Normally, that pattern is considered more\nbearish than a dark cloud cover because the black candle of the engulfing\npattern envelops the entire prior white candle, rather than just part of\nthe white candle, as is the case with the dark cloud cover. But in this\nexample, selling short with the dark cloud cover offered a better trading\nopportunity than selling short with the bearish engulfing pattern.\nAs shown in Exhibit 4.6, the appearance of a bullish candle signal\ndoes not always warrant a new long position.

Based\non the change of polarity principle (where old support becomes new\nresistance), a trader who was looking at the market in early January\n(when the bullish morning star was formed) might then expect a bounce\nto resistance near $1220. So the target is near $1220. To determine the\nrisk in this trade, we would use the candle theory that the low of the\nmorning star pattern should be support.

This means a $36 risk and a $15 target. Not an attractive risk/\nreward trade by any stretch of the imagination! The morale of the story:\ndo not place a trade just because a candle pattern emerges. Note how\nthe bottom of the morning star became support a week later. The rally\nfrom there stalled at the expected $1220 resistance area via a high-wave\ncandle at 1 and the long black real body at 2. These two candles formed\na bearish engulfing pattern. Normally, a bearish engulfing pattern after\nsuch a small preceding uptrend is not too important. But in this specific\ncase, it took an extra significance since it confirmed the $1220 resistance\narea.\nTREND\n\"It is Easier to Run Down a Hill Than Up One\"\nThere is a beautiful Japanese phrase, \"as clouds to the wind and winds\nto the blossom.\" In the context of trading, I would compare the trend to\nthe wind and the price to the clouds or blossoms, whose movements are\ncontrolled by the wind. Thus, determining where the most curtent price\nis in relation to the trend is of vital importance. This means that a candle\npattern should be viewed in the context of the prevailing trend before\ndeciding if a new position should be initiated.\nThe method I usually recommend for incorporating the candle pat-\nterns into the trend is to place a new trade in the direction of the pre-\nvailing trend and to offset a position when there is a reversal signal\nagainst the prevailing trend. For instance, bearish candle signals in bull\ntrends should be used to offset longs (or to take other protective measures\nsuch as selling calls or moving up sell stop levels). But a bullish candle\nsignal in a bull trend could be used to place a new long position. The\nopposite would be true in markets with major downtrends, To wit, ini-\ntiating a short sale on a bearish candle signal should be the main goal in\na bear market. A bullish signal in a bear market could be used to cover\nshorts.\nThere are many ways to determine trend. (In Part 2 of this book, I\nwill reveal some popular methods of trend determination used by Japa-\nnese traders and investors.) The goal of this section is not to help you\nfind the best way to determine trend, but to get you to think about some\nways to incorporate trend into your candle analysis. In this section, I will\ndiscuss some of the more common Western methods of trend determi-\nnation such as trendlines and moving averages.\n",

Specifically, the hammer in July, the morn-\ning star in early August, and a small rising window in late August (which\nalso completed an island bottom). Yet, all these bullish signals were in\nthe context of a bear market (as defined by the downward sloping resis-\ntance line). It was not until the break above the trendline that a new\nbullish trend was confirmed. Note how the rally from this breakout stalled\nat September's dark cloud cover. That dark cloud cover then became a\nresistance level.\nExhibit 4.8 shows how in early July, there was a bearish engulfing\n•\n17\n16\n12:0\nCFZ1 DAILY BAR\n@\n1991 CQG I C.\n0=\n8950\nH=\n8970.\nL-\n8730\n~~\n~I;gv\n.\nDark Cloud .\n..............................................................................................................................\nCover\n.\n.\n.\n.

The long white candles in\nmid-July was a hint of strength. The rally from these candles stopped via\na doji that stalled at the moving average resistance area. This was an\nextremely attractive short sale since that doji area was not only at the 52-\nweek moving average, but it was also at the falling window's resistance\narea. Note how after this sell-off the market bounced back after 9\nrecord session lows.\nBECOMING A MARKET CHAMELEON\n\"An Anny Manages its Victory in Accordance with the Situation of the\nEnemy\"\nWhen first placing a trade, you have expectations about how the market\nshould act.

If not, you will\nhave to take appropriate action. Adapting to changing market conditions\nis what I call being a market chameleon. Being a market chameleon, that\nis, quickly and effectively adapting to a new market environment, is a\nvital element to successful trading. There is an appropriate quote that I\nheard years ago. It compares trading to fencing. It said that in trading,\nas in fencing, there are the quick and the dead. Being a market chameleon\nmeans that you are quick enough to adapt to the market so as to \"live\"\nto trade another day.\nWhen a trader has a market opinion, there should be a price that tells\nhim or her that their market forecast is wrong. I will look at this aspect\nin Exhibit 4.11. In that chart, there was a dark cloud cover in the latter\npart of October. At that point, I turned bearish on this market because a\nconfluence of technical factors hinted that prices would not close above\n$36. There were four reasons to expect any rallies to stall in the $35.50-\n$36.00 area. These were:\n1. The high of the dark cloud cover at $35.50 should become a resistance\narea.\n2. A small falling window provides resistance near $36.\n3. The lows of the three session prior to the falling window were near\n$36. Based on the concept that old support becomes resistance, this\n$36 support should be converted to resistance.\n4. A Fibonacci 62% retracement of the decline from A to B was near\n$35.50.\n",

(Think\nabout what happens with a dark cloud cover. After a strong white ses-\nsion, the market opens higher and then closes well under the white\nsession's close. Doesn't that clearly illustrate how the bears have man-\naged to wrest control from the bulls?) But candles, unlike mathematically\nEXHIBIT 4.13.\nComparing a\nDark Cloud Cover With a Bearish\nEngulfing Pattern\n4-- Close for Bearish\nEngulfing Pattern\nClose for dark\n....1--- cloud cover\nI~\nI\nsuggest thinking about what the pattern is relaying about the market's\naction. For example, in comparing a dark cloud cover with a bearish\nengulfing pattern, I would normally consider the bearish engulfing pat-\ntern as more important. This is based on the fact that the second session\nof the bearish engulfing pattern has a close under the prior white real\nbody. The dark cloud cover's second session, however, has a close within\nthe prior white real body. As such, the bearish engulfing pattern shows\nthat the bears had more control of the market as compared to the dark\ncloud cover (see Exhibit 4.13).\nBut candle patterns can never be viewed in isolation. A trader always\nhas to consider the surrounding technical picture. For example, a dark\ncloud cover that arises at a major resistance area should be construed as\nbeing more likely a reversal than would a bearish engulfing pattern that\nis not at resistance. An instance of the danger of looking at a pattern in\nisolation is shown in Exhibit 4.5 on page 135 where, because of risk/\nreward considerations, a dark cloud cover offered a more attractive trade\nthan did a bearish engulfing pattern. Thus, looking at a candle pattern\nin isolation can be a dangerous procedure. As was nicely expressed to\nme by a Japanese trader, \"where you stand is more important than an\nindividual pattern.\" As a result, if you decide to test out the reliability\nof the candle patterns, remember not to just use a buy or sell signal based\nsolely on the candle pattern. You must first factor into your analysis just\nwhere the pattern emerged.\n",

However, although this was not an ideal dark cloud cover, I still\nviewed it as a dark cloud cover for a few reasons. First was the extremely\nlong upper shadow of the black candle of the pattern. This showed how\nquickly prices retreated from the new highs. In addition, by the close of\nthis black candle, the market was technically damaged because the bears\nwere able to drag prices back under a prior high (marked H on the chart).\nThis formed a bearish upthrust. Finally, the lower close after the dark\ncloud cover helped confirm the market's inherent weakness.\nThus, even the most basic step of having the computer find the candle\npattern may cause problems. So, for those using a computer to pick out\nthe candle patterns, remember that the candle patterns should be used\nas guideposts. While the ideal patterns may be relatively easy to quantify,\nthe less than ideal patterns are often useful trading signals that should\nalso be accounted for. In this context, there is a large degree of subjec-\ntivity required. This is no different from standard bar chart pattern rec-\nognition.\nPlacing the Trade\nIf a candle pattern emerges, does that mean that a buy or sell signal is\nautomatically given? Of course not. As I previously discussed, you should\nnot base a trade on a candle pattern in isolation. You must first determine\nthe overall technical picture at the time the pattern forms.\nAs an example of this aspect, let us consider a shooting star. A com-\nputer program that bases a sell signal on the shooting star alone would\nhave given an improper sell signal if that shooting star also formed a\nrising window (this scenario unfolded in Exhibit 3.49 on page 98). Thus,\nhaving a computer signal a trade just because a candle pattern emerges,\nand ignoring the overall technical picture (i.e., the major trend, the price\naction preceding the candle pattern, etc.), could be a mistake.\nAnother aspect is the concept of risk/reward discussed early in this\nchapter. Just because a pattern appears does not mean that one should\nplace a trade on the candle signal. For example, what if there is a morning\nstar in gold, but the risk for the trade is $15 and your objective is also\nSIS? Would a long position on that pattern be warranted? In this case,\nthe answer is no. Whether a trade is warranted or not is dependent on\nthe risk/reward parameters of the market at the time the pattern is formed.\nAs an example of this, in Exhibit 4.15, I show two hammers.

After the bullish engulfing pattern, an up leg could be expected.\nHowever, the price target of such a rally would be based on other tech-\nnical toolsbesides candles since candles do not usually give targets.\nBased on the concept that old support becomes resistance, a trader\nmight have been looking for a move to the July-August support area near\n$1.85. For that trader, this trade would not have been successful. How-\never, another trader who uses Fibonacci retracements may have been\nmore successful since the market made a Fibonacci 38% bounce of the\nentire move from the September highs to the September lows. Since the\nfirst trader's $1.85 target was not met, he would say that the bullish\ncandle signal was not reliable.

In a tug of war, once the balance of power is lost, one side is\npulled and the result is decided. The market often acts this way, and one\nshould pay attention to the balance of powers.\"! The new (at least in the\nWest) techniques addressed in Part 2 of this book will help you determine\nwhether it is the bulls or bears who have the ''balance of power.\"\nA widely used Japanese tool is the disparity index. It is similar to\nWestern dual moving averages, but this technique allows for better mar-\nket timing than do the traditional Western moving average techniques.\nThe disparity index is addressed in Chapter 5.\nThe charts detailed in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 are called three-line break\ncharts, renko charts, and kagi charts. Of the three, the kagi is probably\nthe most popular, followed by the three-line break and then the renko\nchart. These charts are most closely comparable to the Western point and\nfigure charts. However, it is not necessary to understand point and figure\ncharts to understand any of these Japanese charts.\nJust as candle charts predate bar charts, the three-line break, renko,\nand kagi charts predate point and figure charts. These charts are based\non generations of use in the Far East. A member of the Nippon Technical\nAnalysts Association told me that he had seen a kagi chart of the rice\nmarket dated 1876.

This is because these techniques require only the closing prices.\nThus, mutual funds and yields on financial instruments such as T-\nbonds can be analyzed using a three-line break, renko, or kagi chart.\nBecause three-line break, renko and kagi charts are slower to react\nthan candle charts, they are frequently used by longer term investors.\nHowever, traders with shorter time frame orientations will find that these\ncharting tools provide a practical and powerful method to determine\ntrend direction. Once the trend is determined, candle signals can be used\nto trade in the direction of the prevailing trend.\nAs will be explained in the upcoming chapters, the sensitivity to the\nthree-line break, renko, or kagi charts can be adjusted by changing re-\nversal criteria. With each of these charts, I will show you how to adjust\nthe chart's sensitivity. Short-term traders may want to make the charts\nmore sensitive to the underlying price action. Those who are more con-\ncerned about a broader market perspective may want to use a chart with\nlarger reversal amounts so as to get more information on a chart. This\nshould help to obtain a historical perspective. This brings out another\nimportant advantage of these new charts; by changing the reversal cri-\nteria for these charts, a trader can adjust the sensitivity of the charts to\nhis or her trading needs.\nGenerally, the more sensitive the chart, the greater the number of\ntrading signals and the greater is the possibility of whipsaws, but the\nsooner it may get you into a new trend. A disadvantage of large reversal\namounts is that by the time the trend reversal is made the market will\nbe more distant from the top or bottom.\nChoosing a reversal is subjective and dependent upon many aspects,\nincluding the market's volatility, the price of the underlying commodity\nor stock, a trader's trading style, and his or her time frame orientation\nand risk tolerance. Consequently, I will not attempt to find the optimum\nreversal amount, but I will let you know some of the more popular re-\nversal criteria used by Japanese traders.\nThese new price charts are usually less flexible than are candle charts.\nThis is because, with candle charts, there are more graduations of a re-\nversal signal. For example, a small real body after an uptrend could be\nviewed as a slowing of upside momentum, but not necessarily as a price\nreversal. For the new techniques in Part 2, prices either do or do not\nprovide reversal signals.\nAn important principle about trading with these new charts is that\nthey are usually based on closing prices, so a reversal signal is not con-\nfirmed until the close. By that time, the reversal amount may well be\nexceeded. For example, if the reversal amount is $2, the market would\n",

Some of Japan's moving averages techniques include golden and\ndead crosses, the disparity index, and the moving average divergence.\nBased on my work and discussions with Japanese traders, it appears that\nthe most popular moving averages are the 5-, 9-, or 25-day averages for\nshorter term traders, and for longer term traders, the 13-, 26-week or the\n75- and 200-day moving averages. However, just as in the West, many\nJapanese traders have their favorite moving averages.\nTHE GOLDEN AND DEAD CROSS\nThe Japanese use dual moving averages in which they compare short-\nand long-term averages. For example, they will compare the 13- week\nand 26-week moving averages. As shown in Exhibit 5.1, if a shorter term\nmoving average crosses over the longer term moving average, it is viewed\nas a bullish sign. The Japanese call such a crossover a golden cross. A dead\ncross is a bearish indication that occurs when a short-term moving average\ncrosses under the longer term moving average.\nIn Exhibit 5.2, the 26-week moving average is shown as a solid line,\nand the 13-week moving average as a dashed line. When the shorter term\nmoving average moved under the longer term average in July 1992 it\n157\n",

For example, when the 13-week\ndisparity index is -25%, it means that the market, based on the close, is\n25% under the 13-week moving average. A 200-day disparity index of\n+12% means that the current close is 12% above the 200-day moving\naverage.\nThe Japanese will say, for example, that, \"the separation between the\nprice and the 13-week moving average expanded to 50%\" or \"that the\nmarket was an unusual 31% below its 13-week moving average.\" These\nare references to the disparity index in which the current price is com-\npared to, in both of these cases, the 13-week moving average.\nExhibit 5.3 shows an example using a 9-day disparity index. Looking\nat that exhibit:\nArea 1. When the disparity index is at 0 (shown at 1), it means that\ntoday's price is the same as the chosen moving average (in this\ncase, the 9-day moving average).\nArea 2. When the disparity line is under 0, it means that today's price\nis a percentage under the chosen moving average. At period 2,\nfor instance, the current close is 12% below the 9-day moving\naverage.\nArea 3.

An example: \"The probability is high that\nat a low-price level, a harami cross is a signal that the bottom is near and\na harami cross at a high-price level is a signal that the market is close to\na top.\"l Another example: \"If the koma (this is the Japanese term for a\nspinning top or a small real body candle) appears after some indication\nthat the market is at a low price, then to an extent, one can buy some\nand feel at ease.' ,2\nOf course, the question arises as to what constitutes a high- or low-\nprice area. Some traders have their own methodology to determine\nwhether the market is at a high or low price. They may, for example,\nconsider it at a low area if the market is near a major support area, or if\nit is at a 50% retracement area. Other traders may gauge high or low\nlevels on the relative strength index or stochastics, or on an Elliott wave\ncount.\nA method used by some Japanese to determine whether the market\nis at a high- or low-price is by using the disparity index. This is because\nthe disparity index is an effective mechanism to show if the market is\noversold or overbought. Remember that an oversold environment un-\nfolds when prices descend too quickly. In theory, the more oversold the\nmarket, the more vulnerable it becomes to a bounce. An overbought\nmarket is when prices ascend too far too fast, thus making the market\nsusceptible to a correction. In this regard, a high disparity index reading\ncan show that the market is overbought and a low disparity index could\nreflect an oversold market.\nExhibit 5.4 typifies how the disparity index can offer value-added\nanalysis to a candle chart. Note than an oversold or overbought indication\nbased on the disparity index will depend on the individual market and\nthe chosen disparity index. For this stock, when the 13-week disparity\nindex reached the +10% area, the market became overbought. At a dis-\nparity index near -10%, the market becomes oversold. By using this\nextra information imparted by the disparity ratio in Exhibit 5.4, we can\nget more confirmation of candle signals. Specifically:\n1. As touched upon in Chapter 2, a doji becomes a more viable signal\nif it appears in an oversold or overbought market environment. In\nthis case, the doji at 1 emerged at a time when the market was\noversold (as gauged by the disparity index). This hinted that Delta\nwas ripe for a bounce or sideways action to ease the market's over-\nsold condition. The long white candle after the doji helped confirm\nthe bullish implications.\n2. At time period 2, the market showed signs of overheating, as re-\nflected by the high disparity index. During the same period, a series\n",

Another doji appeared at the same time as the 13-week disparity\nindex was near -10%. This should tell a trader that the market was\nin an oversold environment that should be closely monitored-es-\npecially because of the doji. The tall white candle on the session after\nthe doji completed a morning doji star pattern.\n5. The disparity index moving towards an overbought condition and a\ndark cloud cover warned that the upside drive was losing force.\n6. This is a good example of how the disparity index can help avoid\nbuying in a market that is vulnerable to a correction. A tall white\ncandle at 6 implied a stronger market lay ahead. However, a +10%\ndisparity index reading at that time showed that prices had ascended\ntoo far too fast (i.e., became overbought). The disparity index thus\nprovided a warning sign not to buy the market. It turns out that\ncandle 6 completed a last engulfing top pattern (in which a white\ncandle envelops a black candle in an uptrend) that was confirmed by\nthe next session's weaker close.\n7., 8. These black real bodies, especially the long black body at 8, nor-\nmally imply continued weakness. But the oversold nature of the mar-\nket, as measured by the disparity index, hinted that further down\nmoves were unlikely. Also, the white candle after the black candle\nat 7 had a long lower shadow. This also offset some of the bearishness\nof the black candle.\n9. A classic combination of an overheated market (based on the elevated\ndisparity index) and a bearish candle pattern (the bearish engulfing\npattern). The fact that this bearish engulfing pattern appeared at the\nresistance area from October 1992 (at 6) further reinforced the outlook\nthat Delta was at an important technical juncture.\n10. Here we see how an oversold market joined with a bullish candle\nsignal (the hammer at 10) strongly hinted of higher prices to come.\nIn this chart, the 13-week disparity index gave extreme readings in\nthe ±10% area. However, the markets you follow will probably have\ndifferent disparity zones that act as an overbought or oversold reading,\nso it pays to experiment.\nAs discussed above, the disparity index is a useful tool to weigh\nwhether the market is overbought or oversold. As shown in Exhibit 5.5,\nthe +15% and -15% readings on the 13-period disparity index reflect\ntimes when this market becomes overbought and oversold. Overbought\n",

This would mean that if the 200-day diver-\ngence moves above 110%, it is considered excessive and there is increased\nlikelihood that the market is vulnerable to a correction. This concept could\nbe used as a time to move out of long positions in the belief that the\nmarket is reaching the high end of its current bull leg.\nIn this discussion, remember that high divergence does not necessar-\nily mean that prices will reverse. It is just that the market may be in the\nthroes of speculative fever or panic selling (in the case of low value di-\nvergences), and the likelihood of the move continuing in the same di-\nrection decreases as divergence becomes more extreme.\nlHoshi, Kazutaka, p. 107.\n2Ishii, Katsutoshi, p. 52.\n3Analysis of Stock Price in Japan.

A\nwhite turnaround line (a white line that surpasses the prior three black\nlines) is sometimes likened to a white suit.\nThe short white line that comes immediately after a white turnaround\nline (Le., a white suit) is called a neck since it looks like a neck coming\nout of the white suit.\nThere is a Japanese expression regarding the three-line break: \"Buy\nwhen the neck emerges from the white suit with black shoes.\" The rea-\nson for this expression is as follows:\nstarted.

The same strategy can be used with kagi charts. In the kagi\nchart, this entails waiting for two or more prior highs or lows to be\npenetrated. In Exhibit 8.6., I illustrate how each former high or low is\nreferred to as a level. As illustrated in Exhibit 8.6(A), the thick yang line\nconverts to a thin yin line when the first level (i.e., the previous waist,\nWI) is broken. However, some traders may wait for a two-level break,\nmeaning that the two prior lows at WI and W2 are broken before a sell\nsignal is confirmed. Exhibit 8.6(B) shows a three-level break. This means\nthat the rally has to exceed the prior three highs (the prior three shoulders\n5r53) before a buy is confirmed.\nAs is the case with any technique where extra confirmation requires\nextra time, there is less profit potential once the trend is confirmed since\nthis confirmation takes longer. However, the extra confirmation should\nmean greater probability that the trend has changed. We come back to\nthe immutable law of risk and reward. The less the risk, the less the\nreward.\nIn Exhibit 8.7, a series of lower highs (marked 51-55) and lower lows\n(marked WI-W5) manifested a weakening market. However, this cycle of\nlower highs and lows was broken with the higher high at 56' Area 56\nwas also a two-level break since it moved above the prior two highs (at\n54 and 55)' Further reinforcing the view that this market was bottoming\nwas that the pullback from 56 stopped above the prior low at W5• This\nwas the first time in many months that a low (at W6) was higher than\nthe previous low (at W5) .\nLength of Yang and Yin\nJust as the length of a white or black candle line reflects whether it is the\nbulls or bears who are in charge, so it is with a kagi line.

With all of these techniques,\nthe question that may arise is: Which is the best? I cannot say that kagi\ncharts are better than three-line break or candle charts. They each have\ntheir advantages and uses. For example, kagi, three-line break, and renko\ncharts are useful for providing a view of the market on a macro scale.\nCandlestick charts can be used on a micro scale by providing early clues\nabout market reversals. For example, a member of the Nippon Technical\nAnalysts Society told me that he uses kagi charts and other Japanese\ntools, but waits for a candle signal before placing a trade.\nIn the Introduction to this book, I quoted a samurai who said that,\n\"Learning is the gate, not the house. You first have to go through the\ngate to get to the house.\" Now, I have taken you through the gate and\nup to the door of the house. However, as a Japanese proverb states,\n\"Your teacher can lead you to the door; acquiring of learning then rests\non you.\"\nWith the help of this book, I hope that you have learned enough to\nlay the foundation of basic concepts on which you can build. The tech-\nniques I examined should be viewed as basic tools that you can adjust\nto your individual trading needs and style. There are so many ways to\nuse these exciting and powerful tools.\nEach trader will find that experimenting with the three-line break,\nrenki, and kagi charts will depend on individual factors such as trading\nstyle, risk adversity, and trading time frame orientation.
