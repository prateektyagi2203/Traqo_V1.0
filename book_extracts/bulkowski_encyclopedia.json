No, that was not the date this\nbook first hit the store shelves, but the beginning of a bear market that lasted\n21⁄2 years. Finally, I had bear market data to use for finding chart patterns!\nAfter spending nearly 5 years recovering from the work needed to com-\nplete the first edition, I decided to undertake an update. I changed the editor-\nial content of the book in small ways, but made substantial improvements in\nothers. Here is the list of the important changes:\n• Bull and bear market statistics for complete coverage.\n• Expanded statistics, all in a similar format:\nResults Snapshot, at the start of each chapter shows the most\nimportant numbers and surprises.\nGeneral statistics, including the average rise or decline, busted\npattern performance, and benchmark performance.\nFailure rates, a list of ten breakpoints to show how often a pattern\nfails.\nBreakout and postbreakout statistics, showing performance\nover the yearly price range, pullback rates, and performance after a\ngap.\nFrequency distribution of days to the ultimate high or low,\nshowing when the trend is likely to end.\nSize statistics, describing how performance varies for pattern\nheight, width, and combinations of both.\nVolume statistics, including volume trend, a new concept I call\nvolume shapes, and breakout day volume.\nFor best performance, a list of trading tips and where to find\nthem in each chapter.\n",

      "text": "ix\nPreface to the \nFirst Edition\nWhen I was a little tyke I decided the easiest way to riches was to play the stock\nmarket. It was, after all, a level playing field, a negative-sum game with some-\nbody winning and somebody losing. (Hint: The winner is always the broker.)\nAll one had to do to win was pick stocks that went up and avoid stocks that\nwent down. Easy.\nI kept this in mind when I graduated from Syracuse University with an\nengineering degree and showed up early for my first professional job. Each\nmorning I cracked open the newspaper and plotted my stock picks on a piece\nof graph paper taped to the wall. Bob, my office mate, used the same newspa-\nper to select his stocks. I chose my selections after exhausting fundamental\nresearch, but Bob simply closed his eyes, twirled his hand around, and plunged\nhis finger into the newspaper. When he opened his eyes and removed his fin-\nger, he announced another pick.\nAfter several months of tracking both our selections, I made a startling\ndiscovery: I was getting creamed. Bob’s random selections were beating the tar\nout of my carefully researched choices. I also discovered something else: I was\nlearning a lot by paper trading.\nWith the hesitancy and distrust inherited from my parents, I studied two\ndozen firms before making my final selection and first purchase: I opened a\nmoney market account. The timing was excellent; I was earning over 17% on\nmy cash. At first glance, the return might imply a very risky investment but it\nwas not. The prime rate was, after all, at 21%.\nFlush with success, I gathered my courage and opened a brokerage\naccount and began investing the few pennies I saved. Again, the timing was\nexcellent as I caught the beginning of a major bull market. I bought a stock at\na split-adjusted price of 88 cents and watched it go to $30 and change.\nLest you think that everything was easy, consider what happened. My\nstock portfolio was growing by leaps and bounds, but my professional career\nwas about to take a turn for the worse. After switching careers more often than\n",

      "text": "I sometimes like to admit, I landed a job with a company I could finally call\nhome—a job that would last a lifetime, or so I hoped. Almost 6 months after\nmy 10-year anniversary with the company, I received a letter from the chair-\nman. He congratulated me on my decade with the company and looked for-\nward to even more success for me in the coming years.\nSix weeks later I was laid off.\nI took stock of the situation and decided that, at the age of 36, I had\nenough. Newspapers term guys like me The Missing Million. We are the ones\nwho, for whatever reason, leave their jobs and decide not to go back into the\nworkforce. We retire. Everyone, and I mean everyone (with the notable excep-\ntion of my cousin Mary Ann—bless her heart), thinks we are nuts. They are\nright, of course!\nFor the longest time, I have been fascinated with technical analysis of\nstocks. In the early years, I considered the little squiggles to be nothing short\nof voodoo. Still, I was curious as to why the major brokerage houses were hir-\ning technical analysts in droves. But I did not dare take my eye off the funda-\nmentals simply because I did not know anything about the technicals. Then I\ndiscovered Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine. During my\nlunch hour, I would take the elevator down to the library and read back issues.\nAlthough I saw chart patterns in the stocks I bought, I never really attached\nmuch significance to them. As some of my selections went sour, I began to view\nchart patterns with more respect. The fundamentals always looked good, but\nthe technicals were signaling a trend change just as I was about to pull the trig-\nger. The stocks I bought either lost money outright or I sold them too soon\nand cut my profits short.\nPerhaps this has happened to you. You do fundamental research on a stock\nand then buy it, only to watch it go nowhere for a year or more. Even worse,\nonce you get in, the stock tumbles. Had you looked at the chart the answer was\nalways there. Prices pierced a trend line, a head-and-shoulders top appeared\nout of nowhere, the relative strength index signaled an overbought situation. In\nshort, any number of technical indicators were screaming that a buy now\nwould cost you your shirt. But you never saw the signs.\nYou are not alone; I did the same thing for years. I eventually got so frus-\ntrated with the performance of my stock selections that I decided to do my own\nresearch on technical analysis. I went to the library and read the same thing in\nmany books: A head-and-shoulders formation works most of the time. What\ndoes that mean? Does it mean they are successful 51% of the time or 90% of\nthe time? No one had the answer. I was not willing to risk my hard-earned dol-\nlars on simple bromides. As an engineer I wanted hard, cold facts, not fuzzy\nplatitudes. So, I wrote this book.\nAt the back of the book is an Index of Chart Patterns. If you suspect your\nstock is making a chart pattern but do not know what to call it, the Index of\nx\nPreface to the First Edition\n",

      "text": "Chart Patterns is the first place to look. Page numbers beside each pattern\ndirect you to the associated chapter.\nThe chapters are arranged alphabetically in two sections; chart patterns\nand event patterns. Within each chapter, you are first greeted with a “Results\nSnapshot” of the major findings followed by a short discussion. Then, a\n“Tour” invites you to explore the chart pattern. “Identification Guidelines,” in\nboth table form and in-depth discussion, make selecting and verifying your\nchoices easier.\nNo work would be complete without an exploration of the mistakes, and\nthe “Focus on Failures” section dissects the cause of failures. The all-important\n“Statistics” section follows. How do you trade a chart pattern? That is what the\n“Trading Tactics” and “Sample Trade” sections explore. The “For Best Per-\nformance” section includes a list of tips and observations on how to select bet-\nter performing patterns.\nIf you have ever worked on a car or done some woodworking, then you\nwill recognize the importance of selecting the right tool for the job. You would\nnot want to use a flat-head screwdriver when a Phillips works better. Both do\nthe job but they are hardly interchangeable. Sometimes it is not a screwdriver\nyou should be using, but a chisel. Selecting the proper tools and knowing how\nto use them is half the battle. This book is a lot like that, helping to sort the\nwheat from the chaff. Sometimes a chart pattern is frightening enough that you\nwill want to take profits. At other times, the best trade that you can make is\nnone at all.\nI cannot give you the experience needed to make money in the stock mar-\nket using chart patterns. I can only give you the tools and say, “Go to work on\npaper first.” That is the first step in developing a trading style that works for\nyou, one you are comfortable with, one that improves as you do. If you review\nyour paper trades, you will understand why a stop-loss order is more than a\ntool for the professionals. You will improve your ability to predict support and\nresistance levels that will, in turn, allow you to tighten your stops and get out\nnear the top, cut your losses short, and let your profits run. You will under-\nstand why the statistics in this book are useful for comparison purposes, but\nyour trading results may fall short. You may discover that your girlfriend loves\ndiamonds, but as a chart pattern, they are a lousy investment. One word says it\nall. Experience.\nGood luck.\nTHOMAS N.

He decides it is time to take\noff the gloves: JCB goes public. He uses the money from the initial public\noffering to buy his competitor and add a few more stores around town.\nWith a growing sales base, Jim’s clout allows him to negotiate lower\nprices for the office supplies he is retailing. He passes on part of the savings to\nhis customers, while watching his margins widen, and plows the profits back\ninto building more stores.\nJim calls his friend, Tom, and tells him of his plans to expand the opera-\ntion statewide. They chat for a while and exchange business tactics on how best\nto manage the expansion. When Tom gets off the phone, he decides to con-\nduct his own research on JCB. He visits several stores and sees the same thing:\npacked parking lots, people bustling around with full shopping carts, and lines\nat the checkout counters. He questions a few customers to get a sense of the\ndemographics. At a few stores, he even chats with suppliers as they unload their\nwares. Back at the office, he does a thorough analysis of the financials and\nlooks at the competition. Everything checks out so he orders his trading part-\nners to buy the stock at no higher than 10.\nWhen news of the expansion plan hits the wires, the Street panics. It is,\nafter all, a soft economy and expanding willy-nilly when a recession looms is\ndaft, maybe even criminal, according to the pundits. The stock drops below 10\nand Tom’s crew makes its move. They buy as much as they can without rais-\ning suspicion. The stock rises anyway. It goes back up to 11, then 12, and\nrounds over at 13 before heading back down.\n",

      "text": "Several months go by and the economic outlook is as bleak as ever. The\nstock eases down to 9. After Tom checks in with Jim for the latest public news,\nTom’s team buys more. It is an easy score because investors are willing to\ndump the stock, especially as year-end tax selling approaches.\nSix weeks later the company releases the sales numbers for JCB; they are\nbetter than expected. The stock rises 15% in minutes and closes at 10.75. And that\nis just for starters. Six months later, it’s clear the economy was never in danger of\nentering a recession and everyone sees boom times ahead. The stock hits 20.\nYears go by, the stock splits a few times, and the holiday season looms.\nTom interviews a handful of customers leaving JCB Superstores and discovers\nthat they are all complaining about the same thing: The advertised goods are\nnot on the shelves. Tom investigates further and discovers a massive distribu-\ntion problem, right at the height of the selling season. JCB has overextended\nitself; the infrastructure is simply not there to support the addition of one new\nstore each week.\nTom realizes it is time to sell. He tells his trading department to dump\nthe stock immediately but for no less than 28.25. They liquidate about a third\nof their large holdings before driving the stock down below the minimum.\nSince it is the holidays, everyone seems to be in a buying mood. Novice\ninvestors jump in at what they consider a bargain price. The major brokerage\nhouses climb aboard and tout the stock, but Tom knows better. When the\nstock recovers to its old high, his trading partners sell the remainder of their\nholdings. The stock tops out and rounds over. During the next month and a\nhalf, the stock drifts down, slowly, casually. There does not appear to be a rush\nfor the exits—just a slow trickle as the smart money quietly folds up shop.\nThen news of poor holiday sales leaks out. There is a rumor about distri-\nbution problems, merchandising mistakes, and cash flow problems. Brokerage\nfirms that only weeks before were touting the stock now advise their clients to\nsell. The stock plummets 39% overnight.\nOne or two analysts say the stock is oversold; it is a bargain and investors\nshould add to their positions. Many bottom fishers follow their brokers’ rec-\nommendation and buy the stock. Big mistake. The buying enthusiasm pushes\nthe price up briefly before a new round of selling takes hold. Each day the stock\ndrops a bit lower, nibbling away like waves washing against a castle of sand. In\n2 months’ time, the stock is down another 30%.\nThe following quarter JCB Superstores announces that earnings will\nlikely come in well below consensus estimates. The stock drops another 15%.\nThe company is trying to correct the distribution problem, but it is not some-\nthing easily fixed. It decides to stop expanding and to concentrate on the prof-\nitability of its existing store base.\nTwo years later, Tom pulls up the stock chart. The dog has been flat for\nso long it looks as if its heartbeat has stopped. He calls Jim and chats about the\noutlook for JCB Superstores. Jim gushes enthusiastically about a new retailing\nconcept called the Internet. He is excited about the opportunity to sell office\n2\nIntroduction\n",

Tom is impressed, so he starts doing his homework and is soon buy-\ning the stock again.\nInvestment Footprints\nIf you picture in your mind the price action of JCB Superstores, you may rec-\nognize three chart patterns: a double bottom, a double top, and a dead-cat\nbounce. To knowledgeable investors, chart patterns are not squiggles on a\nprice chart; they are the footprints of the smart money. The footprints are all\nthey need to follow as they line their pockets with greater and greater riches.\nTo others, such as Tom, it takes hard work and pavement pounding before\nthey dare take a position in a stock. They are the ones making the footprints.\nThey are the smart money that is setting the rules of the game—a game any-\none can play. It is called investing.\nWhether you choose to use technical analysis or fundamental analysis in\nyour trading decisions, it pays to know what the market is thinking. It pays to\nlook for the footprints. Those footprints may well steer you away from a cliff\nand get you out of a stock just in time. The feet that make those footprints are\nthe same ones that will kick you in the pants, waking you up to a promising\ninvestment opportunity.\nLet me tell you how I followed one trail of footprints. I sold my holdings\nin Alaska Air because I thought the stock was going down. Here is my note-\nbook entry: “9/6/2001. I put a stop at 31.50 this morning and it hit. The stock\nhas breeched a support level and with weakness in the economy and Septem-\nber/October upon us, it’s time to leave with a small loss [2.5%]. I should have\nbought at the breakout price [of an Eve & Adam double bottom]. The relative\nstrength index peaked twice and now is headed down, suggesting a sale, and the\ncommodity channel index says sell, too.”\nI sold the airline two trading days before the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\nFour days after trading resumed, the stock bottomed at 17.70, nearly half the\nprice at what I sold. The footprints did not lie; they led away from a cliff.\nThis book gives you the tools to spot the footprints, where they predict\nthe stock is heading, how far it will travel, and how reliable the trail you are fol-\nlowing really is. The tools will not make you rich; tools rarely do. But they are\ninstruments to greater wealth. Use them wisely.\nThe Database\nFor this book, I used several databases in which to search for chart patterns. The\nmain database consists of 500 stocks, each with durations of 5 years beginning\nThe Database\n3\n",

      "text": "from mid-1991. I included the 30 Dow Jones industrials and familiar names\nwith varying market capitalizations. Stocks included in the database needed \na heartbeat (that is, they were not unduly flat over the 5-year period) and \ndid not have consistently large intraday price swings (too thinly traded \nor volatile).\nI usually removed stocks that went below $1.00, assuming bankruptcy\nwas right around the corner. Most of the names in the database are popular\nAmerican companies that trade on the NYSE, AMEX, or Nasdaq. The numer-\nous illustrations accompanying each chapter give a representative sample of the\nstocks involved.\nTo capture the bear market of 2000–2002 and expand on the bull mar-\nket since 1996, I included two additional databases. The first uses about 200\nstocks that I follow daily. The other contains about 300 stocks that I no longer\nfollow but that have historical data of limited duration (some issues no \nlonger trade).\nFor rare chart patterns, I use all three databases and search from 1991 to\nthe most recent date available. For plentiful patterns, I use already found pat-\nterns and add those appearing during the bear market. Thus, the number of\nstocks I use to find patterns and the amount of historical price quotes varies.\nIn the first edition of this book, I used a combination of computerized\nalgorithms and manual searching to find chart patterns. The current edition\nincludes the 15,000 patterns from the first edition and others found manually\nsince then, for a total of more than 38,500 patterns.\nStock Performance from 1991 to 2004\nBefore reading about the various chart patterns in this book, it is wise to review\nthe performance of the stock market during the period. Figure I.1 shows a\nmonthly price chart of the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Beginning in\nmid-1991, you can see that the market moved up at a leisurely pace, pausing\nduring much of 1994, and then resuming the climb at a steeper angle in 1995.\nThe index stumbled in August 1998 and made lower lows for 2 more months\nbefore continuing upward, peaking in March 2000, and signaling an end to the\nbull market. The move capped a rise of 418% from the start of the period.\nAfter that, the downhill bear run began, reaching a low in October 2002, for a\ndecline measuring 51%. The index bounced once but made a higher low in\nMarch 2003, signaling a trend change. Thus, the October low marked the end\nof the bear market.\nWhat does all this mean? The bear market measures from March 24,\n2000, to October 10, 2002—about 2.5 years long. For data collection pur-\nposes, the bull market is everything else, about 11 years long. That covers the\nperiod I used to search for chart patterns in this edition.\n4\nIntroduction\n",

It gives you the\ntools to invest successfully. It suggests which chart patterns work best and which\nones to avoid. Whether you can make money using them is entirely up to you.\nI call this book an encyclopedia because that is how I use it. Whenever I\nsee a chart pattern forming in a stock I own, or am thinking of buying, I read\nthe applicable chapter. The information refreshes my memory about identifi-\ncation quirks, performance, and any tips on how I can get in sooner or more\nprofitably. Then I search for similar patterns in the same stock (using different\ntime scales), and if that does not work, I search for similar patterns in stocks in\nthe same industry. I look at them closely to determine if their secrets are\napplicable to the current situation. I try to learn from their mistakes.\nDeveloping an Investment Style\nThe question I am asked most often is, how do I develop an investment style? It is\nusually not asked like that. Most take a more direct approach: How do I make\nmoney trading stocks? When first asked this question, I stumbled over the\nanswer.

Another says it is not blue at all but green,\nwhile the third says it looks like a combination: blue-green. To each individ-\nual, blue looks like blue—just do not try to compare answers.\nDeveloping a trading style is a lot like that. It is an individual endeavor\nthat has a lot in common with experience. I cannot give you experience; I can\nonly suggest ways to acquire your own.\nIf you read a chapter on a bullish chart pattern and buy the first stock\nshowing the pattern in a bull market, you will probably be successful. The first\ntrade nearly always works for the novice, maybe even the second or third one,\ntoo. Eventually, though, someone is going to pull the rug out from under you\n(who knows, maybe it occurs on the first trade). You will make an investment in\na chart pattern and the trade will go bad. Maybe you will stumble across a herd\nof bad trades and get flattened. You might question your sanity, you might\nquestion God, but one thing is for certain: Your trading style is not working.\nMost people buy stocks like they buy fruit. They look at it, perhaps sniff\nit, and plunk down their money. We are not talking about $1.59 here. We are\ntalking about thousands of dollars for part ownership in a company.\nIf you have ever been a board member, you know what I am talking about.\nYou have a fiduciary responsibility to the people who elected or appointed you\nto that position. Not only should you study the material handed to you by the\nstaff, but you have to get out in the field and kick the tires. Do not assume that\nwhat the staff says is always correct or represents the best solution. Question\neverything but learn in the process and try to be helpful without being a pest\n(I always seem to fall into the pest category). As a shareholder—an owner of the\ncompany—should it be any different?\nOnce, I considered buying a position in a company showing an upward\nbreakout from a symmetrical triangle. My computer program told me the com-\npany is a member of the machinery industry and further research revealed that\nit makes refractory products. I continued doing research on the company until\nthe problem gnawing at me finally sank in. I did not have the slightest idea\nwhat a refractory product was. Despite my search for an answer, I was not get-\nting the sort of warm fuzzies I usually get when researching a possible invest-\nment. So, I passed it over. I am trading it on paper, sure, but not in real life.\nCall it the Peter Lynch Syndrome: Do not invest in anything you cannot\nunderstand or explain in a paragraph. Good advice.\nOf course, if you blindly invest in chart squiggles and it works for you,\nwho am I to tell you you are doing it wrong? The fact is, you are not. If you\nconsistently make money at it, then you have developed an investment style\nthat fits your personality. Good for you!\nMy investment style, as you might have guessed, combines fundamental\nanalysis, technical analysis, emotional analysis, and money management. Just\nbecause I rely on technical analysis does not mean I do not look at the price-\nto-earnings, price-to-sales, and other more esoteric ratios. Then there is the\n6\nIntroduction\n",

Three\ndays later, I will want to trade again. Why? Am I trading just because it feels\ngood to be finally back in the thick of things? Am I trading just because the sin-\ngle woman living nearby does not know I exist, and I am acting out my frus-\ntrations or trying to impress her with the size of my wallet? That is where\npaper trading comes in handy. I can experiment on new techniques without\ngetting burned. If I do the simulation accurately enough, my subconscious will\nnot know the difference, and I will learn a lot in the process.\nOnce I come to terms with any emotional issues, I look at money man-\nagement. How much can I realistically expect to make, and how much can I\nlose? What is the proper lot size to take? When should I add to my position?\nHow long will it take for the stock to reach my target and should I invest in a\nless promising but quicker candidate?\nInvesting using chart formations is an exercise in probability. If you play\nthe numbers long enough, you will win out. Sure, some of your investments\nwill fail, and you must learn to cut your losses before they get out of hand. But\nthe winners should serve you well, providing you let them ride. Just do not\nmake the mistake of watching a stock double or triple only to reverse course\nand drop back to where it started. Or worse.\nDay Traders, Position Traders, Buy-and-Hold Investors\nAs I was writing this book, I kept asking myself what is the time horizon for chart\npatterns? Are they best for day traders, position traders, or buy-and-hold\ninvestors? The answer I kept coming up with is: Yes! Chart formations can be\nprofitable for day traders—those people who are in and out of a trade during a\nsingle day. Many day traders have trading styles that depend on chart forma-\ntions, support, and resistance. They concentrate on reliable formations that\nquickly fulfill their measure rule predictions.\nFor position traders, those who hold the trade longer than a day but not\nforever, chart patterns offer convenient entry and exit signals. I put myself in\nthis category. If the trade goes bad, I am out quickly. If it is profitable, I see no\nneed to cut my profits short. When the gains plateau, or if the stock has moved\nabout all it is going to, I consider moving on. Like the day trader, I try to keep\ncash employed by buying formations that promise reliable returns and reach\nthe ultimate high quickly.\nFor the long-term investor, chart patterns also signal good entry and exit\npoints. I remember buying an oil services company knowing that the invest-\nment would not make a significant return for 2 or 3 years. (I was wrong: It dou-\nbled in 3 weeks) I believe that in 3 years’ time, the stock will be in the 30s, a\nsixfold increase from its low. It probably will not qualify as a ten-bagger, but it\nis not small change either. In the short term, the road is going to be rocky, and\nDay Traders, Position Traders, Buy-and-Hold Investors\n7\n",

If this stock goes\nnowhere, then my analysis of the market trend was wrong, and I will have\nlearned a valuable lesson.\nThe Sample Trade\nMost of the sample trades included in the chapters of this book are fictitious.\nEach sample trade uses techniques I wanted to illustrate, incorporating ficti-\ntious people in sometimes unusual circumstances. Call it poetic license, but I\nhope they give you some ideas on how to increase your profits or to minimize\nyour losses.\nStatistics: “I Don’t Believe the Numbers”\nA high, tight flag has an average rise of 69% in a bull market. Question: If you\ntrade this pattern often enough in a bull market, will you make an average of\n69%? Answer: No. Why not? Well, you may be like a friend of mine who has\ntraded stocks a dozen times but made money only once (a few hundred bucks).\nBut here is another reason: The 69% average rise represents 253 perfect trades.\nA perfect trade is one in which you buy at the breakout price and sell at the ulti-\nmate high—the highest high before prices decline by at least 20%. Not only\nare the trades perfect, but also commissions are not included. Your return may\nbe lower . . . or higher. However, I used the same spreadsheet formulas from\npattern to pattern, so you can compare performance in most cases (the excep-\ntions: flags, measured moves, and pennants) without worrying about whether\nyou believe the numbers.\n“If I reproduce your tests, will I get similar results?” Yes. A person in\nIndia I know is pulling 30%, 40%, and more out of the market on a consistent\nbasis. He would claim my statistics are too conservative! A hedge fund manager\nreports that my numbers for the dead-cat bounce are dead solid perfect.\nAnother says that while she was able to reproduce my dead-cat bounce num-\nbers, she was having trouble reproducing others. If you do not follow the\nmethods I used, your results will vary. Guaranteed. So, this edition includes a\nGlossary and Methodology chapter to explain how I measured each result.\nThe method I used opened a door to a new world. In this world, you will\nfind that a month after a breakout in a bear market, price often shows strength.\nYou will discover that when pullbacks occur, performance suffers. You will find\nthat failure rates start low but increase rapidly. Volume shapes, price gaps, pat-\ntern size, and a dozen other performance clues help some patterns but not oth-\ners. Findings like these are what make this book unique. The numbers tell a\nstory of fact that I share with you within the following pages.\n8\nIntroduction\n",

      "text": "Shape. The shape of the formation is distinct. It reminds me of chaos\ntheory where small disturbances oscillate back and forth, then grow un-\nbounded, wreaking havoc. In the stock market, price reaches a new high then\ncrosses over and makes a new low, creating the broadening pattern. When you\ndraw a trend line across the minor highs and another connecting the minor\nlows, the formation looks like a megaphone.\nTrend lines. The two trend lines drawn across the minor highs and lows\nare important. The top trend line should slope up; the bottom one should\nslope down. The diverging trend lines distinguish the broadening bottom from\nother types of formations, such as the right-angled broadening formation\n(which has one horizontal trend line) or the broadening wedge (both trend\nlines slope in the same direction). So it is important that each trend line has a\nslope that is opposite the other.\nTouches. A broadening bottom needs at least two minor highs and two\nminor lows to be a valid formation. Anything fewer means you are incorrectly\nidentifying the formation. What is a minor high or low? A minor high is when\nprices trend up, then drop back down, leaving a clearly defined peak. A minor\nlow is just the same thing flipped upside down: Prices move lower, then head\nback up leaving a clearly defined valley. Figure 1.1 shows five minor highs or\nlows, labeled by numbers. The odd numbers tag the minor highs and the even\nnumbers are the minor lows. Let me stress that the minor highs and lows need\nnot be alternating, as in Figure 1.1. Just as long as you can count at least two\npeaks and two valleys—wherever they may appear—that is fine.\nVolume. There is nothing magical in the volume trend. I performed lin-\near regression from the start of each formation to the end point (not the break-\nout point that is usually a month beyond the end of the formation) and found\nthat volume rises about 57% of the time.\n14\nBroadening Bottoms\nTable 1.1\nIdentification Characteristics of Broadening Bottoms\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nPrice trend\nThe short-term price trend should be downward leading to the\nformation.\nShape\nMegaphone shape with higher highs and lower lows.\nTrend lines\nPrices follow two trend lines: The top one slopes up and the bottom\none slopes down.\nTouches\nShould have at least two minor highs and two minor lows, but not\nnecessarily alternating touches.\nVolume\nThe overall trend is usually upward, sometimes with a U shape.\nBreakout\nA breakout occurs when price closes above the formation’s high\n(upward breakout) or below the pattern’s low (downward breakout).\nSee text for details.

In Figure 1.1, the price decline between peak 1 and trough\n2 shows a receding volume trend. When prices head up from point 2 to point 3,\nso does volume. If you were to place a thin wooden plank between the volume\npeaks in late November and late January, it would bow downward in a U shape.\nA U-shaped volume pattern occurs slightly more often than other shapes.\nBreakout. The breakout point is difficult to identify in a broadening for-\nmation as it develops. I look for the place where price pierces the up or down\ntrend line or makes an extended move. If price pierces the trend line, then the\npenetration point becomes the breakout point. If prices move up and follow\nalong the top trend line without piercing it, then I backtrack to the prior minor\nhigh and draw a horizontal line forward in time until prices cross it. When that\nhappens, that is the breakout point.\nLet me give you an example. Consider the broadening bottom shown in\nFigure 1.2. The price trend over the preceding month leading to the formation\nis downward. The two trend lines outline a widening price pattern as you\nwould expect from a broadening formation. There are more than two minor\nhighs and two minor lows pictured, meeting another criterion mentioned \nin Table 1.1.\nWhere is the breakout? This formation is particularly easy. If you extend\nthe top trend line upward, you find that prices rise well above the line, signal-\ning an upward breakout.

Thus, the decline after a BB in a bear\nmarket must be at a steeper slope than is the rise in a bull market.\nTable 1.3 shows failure rates for BBs. The 5% break-even failure rate is\nlowest in a bear market (9%). The failure rates climb quickly as the maximum\nprice rise or decline changes.

      "text": "terns with downward breakouts fail to drop more than 15%. For upward\nbreakouts, patterns cross the halfway mark between rises of 15% and 25%.\nThese results suggest that you should not depend on a large rise or large\ndecline after a BB. Scanning down each row, we also see that BBs in bull markets\nwith upward breakouts have the lowest failure rates. Those are the ones to buy.\nAnother way to use Table 1.3 is to assess how likely it is that your trade\nwill fail. If you have a cost of trading of 5% and you want to make 20%, how\nmany patterns in a bull market with upward breakouts will fail to rise at least\n25% (5 + 20)? Answer: 59%. Just 41% of the patterns will meet your profit\nmargins. Since the majority will fail, your winners must do quite well to com-\npensate for the losses.\nTable 1.4 shows statistics related to BB performance after the breakout.\nFormation end to breakout. There is a delay between price touching\nthe trend line the final time and closing above it. This delay averages between\n3 weeks and 5 weeks. It takes longer to break out in a bull market than a bear\nmarket because the decline in a bear market is often steeper.\nYearly position. Most of the breakouts occur near the yearly low. This\nmakes sense for downward breakouts, especially those in bear markets. The\nonly exception is in bull markets. They show 44% of the breakouts occurring\nin the middle of the yearly price range.\nYearly position, performance. In most entries, the sample counts are\nfew, making the results unreliable. Those BBs with breakouts following the\nmarket trend (bull market, up breakout and bear market, down breakout) do\nbest when the breakout is near the yearly high.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. The throwback/pullback rate hovers\naround 43% except for BBs in a bear market with a downward breakout. They\npullback 56% of the time. Still, the rates are too low to use in forming a reli-\nable trading strategy.\nThe average time for the stock to return to the breakout price is less than\n2 weeks. In most cases, when a throwback or pullback occurs, performance suf-\nfers. Look for overhead resistance to an upward move or underlying support to\na downward breakout before investing. If the congestion zone is nearby (less\nthan 5% away), prices will likely push through, but overhead resistance will\nretard momentum and performance will suffer.\nGaps. Gaps help performance in a bear market, but the result may change\nwith additional samples. In a bull market, breakout day gaps either hurt per-\nformance or have no influence.\nPartial rises and declines. The next four lines of Table 1.4 concern how\noften a partial rise or decline occurs and if they do occur, how the pattern per-\nforms. A partial decline correctly predicts an upward breakout 80% of the time\nin a bull market. The other variations are less successful, being right about\ntwo-thirds of the time. Figure 1.1 shows a good example of a partial decline\nand Figure 1.4 shows a partial rise. See the Glossary and Methodology chap-\nter for more information.\n20\nBroadening Bottoms\n",

For countertrend trades, performance\nsuffers after a partial rise or decline.\nIntraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises\nand declines appear as small loops hanging from the trend lines. They are par-\ntial rises or declines that failed to breakout: Prices made another crossing of the\nbroadening pattern. Intraformation partial rises or declines occur 13% or less\nof the time.\nTable 1.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Using numbers, it tells how soon your chart pattern will likely top or bot-\ntom out. For example, in a bear market with a downward breakout, over half\n(53%, or 25 + 28) bottom out within 2 weeks. At the other end of the table,\nalmost half the patterns (45%) in a bull market take longer than 2 months (over\n70 days) to reach the ultimate high.\nNotice the slight blip in the numbers around days 35 and 42.

She drew the two trend-line bound-\naries and counted the number of alternating touches (in Figure 1.4, three are\nlabeled as numbers and Point A is the fourth alternating touch).\nSince most broadening formations tend to break out after four alternat-\ning touches and since the price was near the top of the formation heading\ndown, she guessed that the stock would break out downward on the next cross-\ning. So she sold the stock short and received a fill at 13.88. It was a gamble,\nsure, but one she was comfortable making. In any case, she immediately placed\na stop at 14.25, or slightly above the high at point A.\nSusan was overjoyed to see the stock plummet 2 days later and race across\nto the other side of the formation, touching the bottom trend line at point B.\nUsually, her trades are not that easy. She decided to protect her profit and low-\nered the stop to the nearest minor high, shown as point C, at 13.75 or 0.15\nabove the high. Then she waited.\nThe stock bounced off the lower trend line instead of busting through as\nshe hoped. She decided to be patient and see what the stock did next. With her\nstop-loss order in place at the break-even price, she felt protected and com-\nfortable in letting the trade ride.\nThe stock bounced off the 12 support level and did a partial rise before\nmeeting resistance and heading back down. Two days after cresting, she made\nthe determination that on the next touch, the stock would pierce the lower\ntrend line and continue down. She doubled her stake by selling more stock\nshort at 12.75. She was wrong. The stock continued down 1 more day before\nmoving up again. Susan adjusted her stop-loss order to include the additional\nshares, but kept it at the same price level (13.75). Again she waited. The stock\nslowly climbed and reached a minor high of 13.13 before heading down again.\nThis time the decline was strong enough to punch through the support zone\nat the lower trend line.\nWhen the stock descended below point B, Susan lowered her stop-loss\norder to 0.15 above that point or 12.15. Then she looked at the measure rule\nfor the price target. She calculated a target of 9.88 and wondered if the stock\nwould really reach that price. To be safe, she decided to cash out if the stock\nreached 10.15, or 0.15 above the common support price of 10 (a whole num-\nber typically shows support).\nWhen the stock plunged to 10.38 on high volume, she wondered if she\nwas looking at a one-day reversal chart pattern. With those formations, it is\ndifficult to be sure if prices would reverse or not. She decided to hold on to her\noriginal target.\nTwo days later, prices zoomed upward and her stop closed out the trade\nat 12.15.

      "text": "about 2 weeks and established the base on which a horizontal trend line\nappears.\nThe reason for the horizontal trend line is one of perceived value. As the\nstock approached the $12 level, more investors and institutional holders pur-\nchased the stock. The desire to own the stock at what they believed a good\nvalue outweighed the reluctance of sellers to part with their shares. The\ndemand halted the decline in the stock and eventually sent prices skyward\nagain. This happened in mid-April as volume spiked along with the price. The\nenthusiasm caused the stock to reach a new high. Momentum was high enough\nso that the next day, prices rose even further before closing lower. With the\nsecond peak, a tentative trend line drawn along the tops of the formation\nsloped upward and gave character to the broadening formation.\nThe stock moved rapidly back down even as volume increased. This\ndecline stopped before it reached the lower trend line, signaling continued\nenthusiasm. Prices pushed higher and reached a new high, this one at 15.50 on\nMay 6. The up-sloping trend line resistance area repelled any further advance.\nThe stock simply did not have enough upward momentum to push through the\nselling pressure at the new level.\nThe next day volume dried up, but there was enough momentum remain-\ning for another try at the summit. When the attempt failed, the smart money\nheaded back for base camp and volume receded even further. As prices col-\nlapsed, other investors joined in the retreat and volume moved up. In less than\n2 weeks, prices were back at the lower trend line.\nAnother feeble attempt at a new high floundered on unremarkable vol-\nume. The stock moved horizontally and stalled out—a partial rise that often\nspells trouble for a stock. On June 4, prices dropped on high volume and\nreturned to the horizontal trend line. The stock paused there for just over a\nweek before moving down and punching through the support level at 12.25.\nA pullback in a bull market is quite common for ascending broadening\nformations, so it is no surprise that after a rapid 13% retreat, the stock turned\naround and pulled back to the base of the formation. Although not shown in\nFigure 2.2, the stock continued moving up until it began forming another\nascending broadening formation in late October with a base at 16.50.\nThe ascending broadening formation represents the desire of investors\nand traders to own the stock at a fixed price, in this case about 12.25. Their\nbuying enthusiasm pushes prices higher until mounting selling pressure causes\na halt to the rise and sends the stock tumbling. With each attempt, fewer peo-\nple are left willing to sell their shares until they receive an even higher price,\nso a broadening range of prices appears at the top. Eventually, the buying\nenthusiasm at the base of the formation collapses and removes the support for\nthe stock. When that happens, the stock punches through the support level and\ndeclines. It continues moving down until reaching a point where other\ninvestors perceive significant value and buy the stock.\nTour\n31\n",

The bottom of the formation follows\na horizontal trend line, while an up-sloping trend line bounds the top side. \nUp-sloping top trend line. The top trend line touches at least two\nminor highs. The horizontal trend line also shows two minor low touches as\nprices descend to the trend line. The various touch points help define the\nboundary of the formation.\nVolume. The volume trend is usually upward and U shaped, especially in\nthe last third of the pattern. In Figure 2.3, you can see the U shape from Feb-\nruary 1992 to the September 1992 peak, and then rounding down again before\nheading up to the peak in March 1993.\nPremature breakouts. I define premature breakouts to be prices that\nclose outside the formation boundary but return before the formation ends.\n32\nBroadening Formations, Right-Angled and Ascending\nTable 2.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nShape\nLooks like a megaphone with the base of the\nformation horizontal and bounded on the top by\nan up-sloping trend line.\nHorizontal bottom support line\nA horizontal, or nearly so, trend line that connects\nthe minor lows.

      "text": "Premature breakouts for this formation are rare enough that they should not\nbe of concern.\nPrice action before breakout. In some ascending broadening forma-\ntions, prices make higher highs and form a solid, horizontal base at the start but\nthen move sideways for many months. Eventually, prices rise above the for-\nmation top or slide through the bottom trend line and stage a breakout. \nDownward breakout. Once a breakout occurs, a pullback sometimes\nhappens. Prices may continue moving up but they usually bounce off the lower\ntrend line and continue back down. A pullback gives investors another oppor-\ntunity to short the stock or add to their short position. Before shorting, how-\never, make sure the pullback is complete and prices are declining once again.\nSupport and resistance. I chose Figure 2.3 because it shows the two\ncommon areas of support and resistance. These areas follow the trend lines.\nAlong the base of the formation projected into the future, the support area\nrepels the decline over 2 years after the formation ends. The rising trend line\ntells a similar tale; it repels prices three times nearly a year later. The implica-\ntions of this observation can be profound. If you own a stock and it is breaking\nout to new highs, it would be nice to predict how high prices will rise. One way\nto do that is to search for formations such as this one. Many times, extending\nthe trend lines into the future will predict areas of support and resistance.\nAlthough the trend line did not predict the absolute high, it did suggest\nwhen prices would stall.

      "text": "Focus on Failures\nWhat can we learn from a review of the failures of this formation? Figure 2.4\nshows two broadening formations; the one on the left fails to descend but the\none on the right makes up for it. The figure makes one lesson clear: Always\nwait for a confirmed breakout before taking a position in a stock; that is, wait\nfor prices to fall below the lower trend line before selling your long position or\nselling short. Even though most ascending broadening formations break out\ndownward, the failure rate is too high to hazard an investment before knowing\nthe outcome. Had you sold the stock short during the first formation, your\nposition would not have made money for almost half a year. Look back at Fig-\nure 2.3. A short position in the stock at the lower trend line would have lost\nmoney for years.\nSelling a stock prematurely is just as bad. If you held a long position in\nthe stock shown in Figure 2.4 but sold it during June, you would have regret-\nted your trade until December when the footwear company slipped. Had you\nwaited for a downward breakout, you would have remained in the stock as it\nascended.

Few busted patterns occur, so the num-\nbers are unreliable. Still, they indicate the type of move prices make after trav-\neling less than 5% after the breakout.

For\nexample, 8% of the broadening patterns with downward breakouts in a bear\nmarket fail to drop more than 5%. This almost triples to 22% failing to drop\nmore than 10%. Over half (60%) fail to drop more than 25% after the breakout.\nComparing the columns, we see that the bull market, up breakout column\nshows the lowest failure rates. This makes sense because it is also the best per-\nformer (it has the highest average rise, as per Table 2.2).\nTable 2.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics. \nFormation end to breakout. It takes between 2 and 4 weeks for prices\nto close outside the trend-line boundary. This observation suggests that prices\noften bounce off the trend line, curl around, and then take their time making\ntheir way back to pierce the boundary.\nYearly position. Most of the breakouts occur near the yearly high for\nupward breakouts, and in the middle of the yearly price range for downward\nbreakouts. \nYearly position, performance. Mapping the performance over the\nyearly price ranges, we find that upward breakouts occurring near the yearly\nhigh in a bull market perform well. Downward breakouts do well when the\nbreakout is near the yearly low. \nThrowbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur about half\nthe time, and it takes the stock about 10 days to return to the breakout price.\nWhen they occur, performance suffers, as Table 2.4 shows.\nGaps. For patterns with upward breakouts, gaps hurt performance, but\nthe low sample count may be the reason. For downward breakouts, gaps either\nhelp performance or cause no pain. Notice the large gap size in a bear market\nafter a downward breakout.\nPartial rises and declines. A partial rise or decline is an accurate gauge\nof an impending breakout. Consult the Glossary on how to recognize them.\nUsing a partial rise or decline, you can get into the stock at a better price than\nif you wait for the breakout.\nDoes a partial rise or decline interfere with momentum? Yes. If you com-\npare the average rise or decline from Table 2.2 with the partial rise or decline\nperformance in Table 2.4, you will find that performance suffers after a partial\nrise or decline. However, using the feature to enter a trade earlier than the\nbreakout will tend to help performance.\nIntraformation partial rises and declines. How often does a partial rise\nor decline fail to predict an immediate breakout? Answer: between 4% and\n15% of the time, depending on the market conditions and breakout directions.\nTable 2.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. We have seen that the decline in a bear market is usually swift. Almost half\nof downward breakouts reach the ultimate low in less than 2 weeks. Upward\nbreakouts take more time to reach the ultimate high, sometimes much longer.\nIn a bull market, 48% are still searching for the top after 70 days.\n38\nBroadening Formations, Right-Angled and Ascending\n",

      "text": "What does all this mean? In a bull market and with a pattern having an\nupward breakout, be patient. For other combinations of market conditions and\nbreakout directions, watch your stock closely for fatigue. Use the measure rule\nto estimate a target price and consider selling if prices near the target. Remem-\nber, you never go broke taking a profit (just be sure to keep those losses in\ncheck).\nAlso, watch for weakness a month after the breakout. During that time,\nprices tend to reverse. Table 2.5 shows this movement during days 42 (bull\nmarket, up breakout) and 42 to 49 (bull market, down breakout).\nTable 2.6 shows size-related statistics. \nHeight. In all cases, broadening patterns that are taller than the median\nheight performed better than did their shorter counterparts.\nWidth. Wide patterns performed better than narrow ones for breakouts\nthat agree with the prevailing market trend (upward breakout, bull market or\ndownward breakout, bear market). Countertrend trades show either no differ-\nence or narrow patterns that perform slightly better. I used the median length\nas the divider between narrow and wide.\nAverage formation length.

Most of the broadening patterns do well when a dome-\nshaped volume pattern appears. The one exception is a bull market with a\ndownward breakout; they perform better with U-shaped volume.\nBreakout volume.

Bear markets targets are correct 43% (up\nbreakouts) and 51% (down breakouts) of the time.\nFor a more conservative approach, try calculating the formation height and\ndividing by 2, and then applying the difference to the pattern’s high or low price.\nFigure 2.5 makes the measure rule clear. The height of the formation is\nthe difference between the highest high (34.13) and the trend-line price\n(29.25), or 4.88. Subtract the result from the trend-line price, giving a target\nprice of 24.37. The nearer target in the figure uses half the formation height,\nor 2.44, to give a price target of 26.81. \nPartial rise or decline. A partial rise or decline can be difficult to trade\nbecause prices often pause partway across the chart pattern on their way to the\nopposite side. This pause looks like a partial rise or decline. Wait before buy-\ning to be sure that prices are unlikely to continue in the original direction. Try\nbuying when prices close beyond the halfway point between the minor\nlow/high and the trend line. \nFor example, if the top trend line is at 20 and prices have declined from\nthere to 14 then started back up in what you suspect is a partial decline, buy\nwhen the price closes above 17 (that is half the distance between 20 and 14). You\nmight use Fibonacci retracements of 38%, 50%, or 62% as buying locations. If\nprices turn at those retracement levels, then consider opening a position.\nTrading Tactics\n41\nTable 2.8\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nCompute the formation height from highest high to the\nhorizontal trend line. For upward breakouts, add the height\nto the highest high in the pattern. For downward breakouts,\nsubtract the height from the value of the horizontal trend\nline. The result is the target price. More accurate targets use\na formation height divided by 2.\nPartial rise or decline\nUse a partial rise or decline as an entry signal.\nWait for confirmation\nIf you own the stock and prices close below the lower trend\nline, sell.\nIntraformation trade\nFor tall patterns, buy near the lower trend line and sell near\nthe top as prices curl down.\n",

Pullbacks hurt performance. Patterns\nwith dome-shaped volume and heavy\nbreakout volume do well.\nAfter searching for this pattern in daily price data, I found 140 patterns with\nupward breakouts and 134 with downward ones. Upward breakouts show the\npattern performing as a continuation of the uptrend twice as often as a rever-\nsal. Downward breakouts show the opposite: more act as reversals. Continua-\ntions perform better in bull markets, reversals in bear markets, regardless of the\nbreakout direction.\nThe bull market break-even failure rate is about three times the bear\nmarket rate. This finding suggests the pattern is happier in a bear market.\nThat analysis changes for higher failure rates. In other words, this pattern per-\nforms well in a bear market to begin with, but for longer trades, patterns in a\nbull market show smaller failure rates.\nAfter the breakout and after prices reach the ultimate low, the rebound is\nspectacular: 55%. Thus, if you can correctly identify when the trend changes,\nyou can make a ton of money—even if you are late getting into the trade.\nHowever, the right-angled and descending broadening (RADB) chart\npattern gives lackluster performance. The average rise or decline is well below\nthat of other chart pattern types, so trade this one carefully. \nTour\nWhat do descending broadening formations look like and why do they form?\nFigure 3.1 is an example of the chart pattern.

      "text": "Just as with other chart pattern types, the failure rates climb substantially\nfor minor increases in the maximum price rise or decline. About half the pat-\nterns will fail to move more than 20%. \nLater I discuss the measure rule, but suppose it says that prices will climb\nfrom 10 to 13, a 30% move. How likely is that in a bull market? Table 3.3\nshows the answer. Since 63% fail to climb more than 30%, it seems unlikely\nthat prices will reach 13. Be conservative and set a lower target.\nTable 3.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.\nFormation end to breakout. It takes between 3 and 6 weeks before\nprices close outside the pattern’s trend-line boundary. Thus, if you do not\nimmediately recognize the broadening pattern, you should still have plenty of\ntime to take appropriate action. \nYearly position. Where in the yearly price range do we find the break-\nout from the broadening pattern? For upward moves, the breakout occurs most\noften within a third of the yearly high. Downward moves show the reverse,\nwith many patterns breaking out near the yearly low.\nYearly position, performance. Which of the three price ranges per-\nforms best? The results map across market conditions. Broadening patterns in\nbull markets seems to perform best when the breakout is in the middle of the\nyearly price range. For bear markets, those with breakouts near the yearly low\nperform best. \nThrowbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur about half\nthe time, and it takes the stock less than 2 weeks to return to the breakout\nprice. When a throwback or pullback occurs, performance suffers. Look for\nnearby support or resistance zones that might interfere with price movement\nand cause a retrace.\nGaps. Most of the time, breakout day gaps hurt performance. The lone\nexception is in a bull market with a downward breakout from an RABD. In that\ncase gaps help, but the samples are few.\nPartial rises and declines. A partial rise or decline works best in a bear\nmarket. They correctly predict the breakout direction between 66% and 80%\nof the time. Bull markets do not fare as well, being correct between 54% and\n63% of the time. Still, a partial rise or decline allows you to enter a position in\na stock before the breakout and at a better price. \nIf you compare the average rise or decline from Table 3.2, you will find\nthat a partial rise or decline usually hurts performance. \nIntraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises\nand declines are rare, ranging between 17% for patterns with upward break-\nouts in bear markets, to 6% for patterns with downward breakouts. An\nintraformation partial rise or decline looks like a loop touching the trend line.\nThey occur once the pattern is established (at least two touches of each trend\nline), but a breakout in the anticipated direction does not follow. Instead, prices\ncross the pattern to the opposite trend line. Since the numbers are so low, they\nshould not be of concern.\n56\nBroadening Formations, Right-Angled and Descending\n",

Just 29% (20 + 9) reach the ultimate high in two weeks—the\nbest (lowest) of the group—but it also shows that nearly half (49%) continue\nrising after 70 days. This finding suggests that the combination (bull/up) is the\nbest performing, and a look back at Table 3.2 confirms that expectation.\nWhat do all the numbers mean? If you have a broadening pattern with a\ndownward breakout and the general market (as measured by the S&P 500\nindex) is bullish, scan the table to help determine how long it will take to reach\nthe ultimate low. There is a good chance that it will occur in the first week, as\n33% reach bottom in that period. Since the numbers are additive, nearly half\n(42%, or 33 + 9) bottom within 2 weeks.

If the result is above the median, then you have a tall pattern; below\nthe median means it is a short one. Invest only in tall patterns unless you feel\nconfident of your assessment.\nWidth. Narrow patterns outperform wide ones in a bear market. In a bull\nmarket, there is either no performance difference or wide patterns do slightly\nbetter.

Does the potential profit justify the risk of the trade? For Figure\n3.6, there is support in the 46 to 47 area. Examining the peaks and valleys of\nthe prior price action determines support and resistance levels. In March 1995\n(not shown in the figure), there is an area of congestion bounded by a sym-\nmetrical triangle with an apex at about 46. Additional resistance appears in July\nand October, as shown. Together, the 46 to 47 area makes a good location for\na stop-loss order.\nLet us say the stop is 45.75, just below the bottom of the support area. If\nthe trade happens at 50.50, which is the close the day after the upward break-\nout, that gives a potential loss of less than 10%. With a target price of 55.50,\nor 10% upside, the win/loss ratio is an unexciting one to one. In such a situa-\ntion, you could either tighten your stop by moving it higher (and risk getting\ntaken out by normal price action) or look elsewhere for a more profitable trade.\nRemember there is no rule that says you have to place a trade.\nIntraformation trading.

For upward breakouts, add the result to the value\nof the horizontal trend line. For downward breakouts,\nsubtract the value from the lowest low. The result is the\nexpected target price.\nWait for confirmation\nIt is unclear which way prices will break out, so it is best to\nwait for prices to close outside the trend lines. Once they do,\nexpect prices to continue moving in the direction of the\nbreakout. Place your trades accordingly.\nStops\nOnce a breakout occurs, consider the opposite side of the\nformation as the stop-loss point. However, in many cases you\nwill want something closer to your purchase price, so look for\nnearer support or resistance zones. Once the stock moves\nsubstantially, advance the stop to the break-even point or\nhigher.\nIntraformation \nFor aggressive traders, consider placing a trade as prices \ntrading\nreverse course at the trend line.

      "text": "top formation. Astute traders jumped on the bandwagon at this point and pur-\nchased the stock. They wanted to play the anticipated rise as the formation\nbroadened out. The stock cooperated and moved higher, reaching the top\ntrend line once again at a new high of 55.50.\nThe steepness of the ascent in the latter stages was unsustainable. The\npeak looked like a one-day reversal, with a close near the low of the day and a\ntall daily price swing. However, volume was unconvincing. It was higher that\nday than during the prior week, but it certainly was not of the caliber of the late\nNovember spike. In any case, the stock tumbled and soon reached a new low of\n43.50, stopping right at the down-sloping trend line. Once the stock began\nmoving higher, the momentum players jumped on board and volume increased\nalong with the price. Buying enthusiasm and rising momentum pushed the\nstock higher, climbing through the top trend line. An upward breakout occurred.\nThroughout the various peaks and troughs of this formation, there was a\nstruggle between buyers and sellers. Near the lows, the buyers believed the\nstock was oversold and they eagerly bought it. At the top, they quickly sold\ntheir shares and pocketed handsome profits. This selling, of course, sent the\nstock back down.\nSome investors, seeing the stock decline below their purchase price and\nstill believing that the stock had value, bought more. That behavior also helped\nturn the stock around at the lows and probably explained their heightened\nnervousness at the tops. They wanted to keep their gains this time, instead of\nwatching them evaporate should the stock decline again. \nThe formation in Figure 4.1 also makes evident that identifying the ulti-\nmate breakout is exceedingly difficult. It appears that each new high or new\nlow may be the final breakout. Only when prices move in the opposite direc-\ntion is it clear that prices will not break out. We explore ways to profit from\nthis behavior in the Trading Tactics section.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 4.1 shows the identification guidelines for the broadening top formation. \nPrice trend. The first criterion is the price trend leading to the forma-\ntion. This price trend is what differentiates a broadening top from a broaden-\ning bottom. For a broadening top, the price trend should be leading up to the\nformation, not down as in its bottom counterparts. This is just an arbitrary des-\nignation I have chosen to distinguish the two formations.\nShape and trend lines. Trend lines drawn across the peaks and valleys\nresemble a megaphone. Higher highs and lower lows make the formation obvi-\nous to those versed in spotting chart patterns. The slope of the trend lines is\nwhat distinguishes this formation from some others. The top trend line must\nslope up and the bottom one must slope down. When one of the two trend\n66\nBroadening Tops\n",

When the two trend lines\nslope in the same direction, the formation is a broadening wedge.\nTouches.There should be at least two minor highs and two minor lows\nbefore the chart pattern becomes a broadening top. Figure 4.1 shows three minor\nhighs touching the top trend line and four minor lows either nearing or touching\nthe bottom trend line. The minor highs and minor lows need not alternate as\nprices crisscross the formation.\nVolume. Linear regression on the volume trend shows it trending up.\nMany times, the volume pattern mimics the price pattern: rising and falling\nalong with price. However, my research shows that a U-shaped volume pattern\noccurs most often.\nBreakout. A breakout happens when prices move outside the trend-line\nboundaries or follow a trend line for an extended time. In Figure 4.1, if you extend\nthe top trend line upward, it will intersect prices at about 58. Prices push through\nthis level and move higher. When a breakout occurs, I consider the actual break-\nout price to be the value of the highest peak in the formation. In Figure 4.1, for\nexample, the breakout price is 55.50, or the high at the early December peak.\nFor an example of how to apply the various guidelines, consider the\nbroadening top shown in Figure 4.2. At first glance, it looks like a large mega-\nphone with price trends that generally follow two sloping trend lines. The top\ntrend line slopes upward and the bottom one slopes downward, each intersect-\ning the minor highs or lows at least twice. Prices, over time, form higher highs\nand lower lows until they break out of the formation, generally moving beyond\nthe line of trend before retracing.\nIdentification Guidelines\n67\nTable 4.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nPrice trend\nThe intermediate-term price trend leading to the formation\nshould be up.\nShape\nMegaphone shape with higher highs and lower lows.

This observation suggests that in a bull\nmarket, you should be patient. \nIn a bear market with a downward breakout, 30% reach bottom in the\nfirst week. Half (48%) bottom in 2 weeks.

      "text": "76\nBroadening Tops\nTrading Tactics\nTable 4.8 outlines trading tactics for broadening top formations. \nMeasure rule. The first thing to consider about trading tactics is the\nmeasure rule. The measure rule predicts the price to which the stock will\nmove. For many formations, one simply computes the height of the formation\nand adds the result to the breakout price. Broadening formations are not much\ndifferent. Consider Figure 4.5. The height of the formation is the difference\nbetween the highest high (12.13) and the lowest low (10), or 2.13. For upward\nbreakouts, add the height to the highest high in the chart pattern giving a min-\nimum price move of 14.26, as shown in the figure.\nHow do you make use of the measure rules? Imagine that you are con-\nsidering purchasing the stock. Since it is never clear which way a broadening\nformation will ultimately break out, it is difficult to pick a good long-term\nentry point. The easiest way to invest using the formation is to buy just after\nthe stock turns at the bottom trend line.\nGo long at the low.

In the example\nshown in Figure 4.5, the purchase price is about 10.38 and the target price is\n14.25, a 37% move. The stop loss should be 9.85, for a potential loss of 5%,\nwhich gives a reward-to-risk ratio of 7 to 1, more than enough to risk a trade.\nOn an upward breakout, prices reach the target about 60% of the time.\nThus, do not depend on prices reaching the target.\nLong stop. Buy the stock as soon after it touches the lower trend line and\nmoves higher. Place a stop-loss order 0.15 below the lowest low (0.15 below\npoint A). Should prices drop, your position will likely be sold before a large \nloss occurs.\nIf the stock fails to break out upward, perhaps you can join the ride to the\nupper trend line. Buy when prices turn upward at the lower trend line, then be\nready to sell once prices reach the old high. Prices may pause for a bit before\nmoving higher and tagging the top trend line or they may reverse at this point.\nMake sure your stops have been raised to protect your profits.\nWhat about the measure rule for downward breakouts? Again, the for-\nmation height is 2.13. Subtract 2.13 from the lowest low (10) to arrive at the\ntarget price of 7.87. If prices break out downward, they should reach 7.87.\nHowever, the reliability of the target price for downward breakouts is just 35%\n—not very reassuring.\nShort tips. For short positions in broadening tops, open the short after\nthe price touches point B and begins heading down. Place a stop 0.15 above the\nhighest high (12.28 in this case) to limit your losses. Lower your stop to the\nnext minor high or apex of the broadening top (either 11.88 or 11.13 in this\ncase) once the stock nears point A. Sometimes the stock will not make it down\nto the trend line before beginning to move up. At other times, there is a\nlengthy pause before prices turn around or continue down. A lower stop-loss\npoint helps you achieve at least some measure of profit.\nPartial decline. The last trading tactic is to look out for partial rises or\ndeclines, which occur when prices begin to cross the formation but do not\ncome close to the opposite side. Instead, prices reverse course and break out\nsoon after. When you see a partial rise or decline, place a trade once the stock\nreverses course. If a breakout happens, then consider adding to your position.\nSample Trade\nSandra has always taken a liking to the stock market but never had enough\nmoney to jump into the game. Still, she paper traded stocks just to get a feel for\nthe markets and dreamed of one day trading for real.

After paying taxes to the government, she sud-\ndenly realized there was no need to continue working. “Why wait till I’m older\nwhen my health might be gone or I might die young like my parents?” She\nretired at 29.\nSandra knew that if she cut her expenses to the bone she could live off the\nsavings. She paid off the mortgage, the car loan, and the credit card balances,\nand she stopped going out to eat in restaurants. Her lifestyle changed to\naccommodate the limited income, but one thing she would not compromise:\nher paper trading.\nAfter opening a brokerage account, she waited for the perfect trade and\nfinally found it; the one shown in Figure 4.5. She saw the broadening top for-\nmation early enough to buy into the stock before the breakout. Two days after\nthe stock reached point A, she placed her order and received a fill at 10.50.\nImmediately, she placed a stop 0.15 below the lowest low, or 9.85 for a poten-\ntial loss of 6%.\nSandra applied the measure rule and was looking at a target of 14.25. If\neverything worked as expected, that would give her a return of over 35%. After\nshe placed the trade, she sat back and waited but kept an eye on the price\naction. When prices paused at the high of the formation, she wondered if the\ntrend was going to reverse. She considered taking her profits and running but\ndecided against it. After a few days, she recognized a flag formation and hoped\nthat it represented a half-staff move (the flag being a halfway point in the\nupward move). If that were true, she could expect a climb to 13.25 (that is the\ndistance from the top of the flag (12.13) to the start of the move at 10 projected\nupward using the lowest low in the flag at 11.13).\nA few days later, the stock not only fulfilled the measure rule for the flag\nformation, but for the broadening top as well. Did Sandra sell? No. Since the\nstock was moving up, she decided to let her profits ride. However, she did raise\nher stop to 11.85, or 0.15 below the formation high. She viewed this point as a\nsupport zone and hoped that should the stock retreat to that level, it would\nrebound before taking her out.\nIn mid-February, just after the second peak around 17 appeared, she rec-\nognized a double top formation. She moved her stop to 0.15 below the confir-\nmation point, or 14.25. About 2 weeks after raising her stop, her position sold\nwhen the stock plunged from the prior close at 15.63 to 12.13. After commis-\nsions, she made 33% in less than 4 months.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select broadening\ntops that perform better after the breakout.

Since the pattern is so rare in a bear market, many of the remarks in\nthis chapter concern bull markets only. The break-even failure rate is probably\nhigher than the 2% shown in a bull market due to the low sample count. For\ndownward breakouts, the break-even failure rate is probably accurate at 11%.\nThe 38% average rise is above the 36% rise for other bullish chart patterns. \nIf you can tell when the trend changes, you can make a lot of money after\na downward breakout. For example, after the stock reaches the ultimate low,\nprices rise an average of 49%. Thus, even if you miss the turn, there are still\nprofits waiting if you trade the pattern properly.\nABWs have a few surprises, most of which we have seen before. A partial\nrise comes at the end of the pattern, and it accurately predicts a downward\nbreakout about 75% of the time. More about that and the other surprises in the\nStatistics section.\nTour\nWhat does an ascending broadening wedge look like? Consider the chart pat-\ntern in Figure 5.1. The first thing you notice is the two sloping trend lines; the\ntop one has a slightly steeper slope than the bottom one. Together, the two\ntrend lines spread out over time but both slope upward. Once prices pierce the\nbottom trend line, they drop rapidly. The chart looks like a pie-shaped wedge\nthat slopes uphill. That is why it is called an ascending broadening wedge. The\nprice action alternates and is contained by two nonparallel trend lines. \nFigure 5.2 shows a better example of a broadening wedge, with two up-\nsloping trend lines where the slope of the top trend line is much steeper than\nthe bottom one.\n82\nBroadening Wedges, Ascending\n",

      "text": "Figures 5.1 and 5.2 both show a similar situation. The formation appears\nat the end of a rising price trend and signals a reversal. Although a reversal is\nnot always the case, nor is the formation required to be at the end of a rising\nprice trend, both situations occur more often than not.\nFigure 5.2 also shows an interesting pattern that is key in identifying the\nstart of a new price trend: the partial rise. After touching the lower trend line,\nprices again move up but fail to touch the higher trend line. As prices descend,\nthey pierce the lower trend line and continue moving down. The chart also\nshows a similar situation that occurs earlier in the price pattern, around the\nstart of the new year: That rising price trend fails to touch the upper trend line.\nPrices return to the lower trend line, then rebound and zoom up again to\ntouch the higher trend line. The partial rise fails to predict a change in trend.\nWe explore partial rises later.\nWhy does a broadening wedge form? Pretend for a moment that you are\nthe head of an investment conglomerate that has big bucks to spend and wants\nto buy shares in another company. When the price is low, you instruct your\ntrading department to begin buying. The sudden buying demand forces the\nprice to climb even though the trading department spreads its orders over sev-\neral days and through several brokers. The trading department tries to keep its\nbuying quiet, but the word gets out that you are in the market. The momen-\ntum players jump on your coattails and ride the stock upward by buying too.\nThis sends the stock higher than you expected, so your trading department\nstops buying for the moment.\nValue investors, sensing an overbought situation developing, are willing\nto sell their shares at the higher price. Soon the stock is moving down again.\nBut before it can reach its old low, the buy-the-dip crowd jumps in and halts\nthe decline. Your trading department, seeing a higher low form, jumps back in\nand buys while the price is still reasonable. Some new value investors also\ndecide the stock is worthy of a flyer and add to the buying pressure. The com-\npany itself gets into the act and buys shares authorized by the board of direc-\ntors as a share-buyback program announced long ago. The buyback program\nis nearing the expiration date and the company feels it is the right time to buy\nto complete their promise to shareholders.\nThe stock makes a new high. When it climbs high enough, the selling\npressure overwhelms the buying demand and sends the shares lower, but the\nprice will not drop far—not with everyone trying to buy at a good price. What\nyou have then are much higher highs from the unbridled buying enthusiasm\nand higher, but more sane, lows as your conglomerate and the company itself\ntry to buy near a fixed low price. You never quite succeed and pay higher and\nhigher prices as the minor lows move up.\nSoon, however, the stock is too pricey even for your tastes. You may even\ndecide it is time to sell some, or all, of your holdings. Meanwhile, the momen-\ntum players send the stock coasting higher, but this time the price does not\ncome close to the upper trend line.\n84\nBroadening Wedges, Ascending\n",

The same-store\nsales numbers are going to be lower this quarter, the shorts say. This time the\nrumor finds sympathetic ears. The rumble heard earlier is the stampede of the\nsmart money running for the exits. The price drops quickly. It may hover for a bit\naround support zones while novice investors, who have not gotten the word, buy\nthe stock. When they finish placing their trades, the meager buying demand\nabates and the stock crashes through the lower trend line and heads down further.\nIdentification Guidelines\nThere are a number of identification guidelines, outlined in Table 5.1, that\nmake this formation unique. As I discuss the different guidelines, consider the\nascending broadening wedge depicted in Figure 5.3. This formation is differ-\nent from Figures 5.1 and 5.2 in that it is born from a region of consolidation.\nFrom the beginning of the study in July 1991, prices move generally horizon-\ntally and do not fall much below the 15.38 level (Figure 5.3 shows only a por-\ntion of the prior price action).\nThe situation changes just before the new year. Prices start moving up on\nDecember 23. They reach a new high in mid-January but soon move down. At\nthat point, two tentative trend lines connect the highs and lows. Although it is\ntoo early to form a definitive conclusion, a broadening wedge appears to be\ntaking shape. After prices move up and touch the upper trend line then pull\nIdentification Guidelines\n85\nTable 5.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nShape\nLooks like a megaphone, tilted up, with price action that\noutlines two up-sloping trend lines.\nTrend lines\nThe top trend line has a steeper upward slope than the lower\none and neither is horizontal.\nTouches\nThere should be at least three distinct touches (or near\ntouches) of the trend lines on each side.

The partial rise and trend-line penetration suggest\na trend change is at hand.\nIt is a false breakout. Prices travel higher for 3 days in a tight, narrow pattern\nthen zoom upward and touch the upper trend line. The bottom trend line has to\nbe redrawn to accommodate the slight decline below the old trend line. Clearly,\nprices have more work to do before declining below the lower trend line.\nA month later, prices return to the lower trend line and move higher for\na few days. However, the rise stalls and prices pierce the lower trend line. Like\na replay of the price action a month earlier, prices pull back to the trend line\nand start moving higher.

The volume pattern is irregular but generally rises as prices move\nup and recedes as prices decline. Although it is not clear from the charts, volume\ntends to rise over time. However, this tendency is slight when considering all\nascending broadening wedges and is not a mandatory selection guideline.\nBreakouts. Figure 5.3 shows an exceptional premature breakout. Usu-\nally, prices follow the lower trend line and do not penetrate it until very near\nthe breakout. When prices do break out, the price action can be messy, as\nshown in the figure. Sometimes price runs straight through the lower trend\nline without pausing, and sometimes it weaves around the trend line before\nfinally continuing down. In either case, the breakout is usually downward.\nPartial rise. The partial rise, already mentioned, occurs in half of the\nascending broadening wedges. Since it usually occurs just before a breakout, it\nis an important trend change indicator. In a partial rise, prices start moving up,\nafter having touched the lower trend line, then stop before touching (or com-\ning close to) the upper one.

Thus, it is more profitable to trade with the\ntrend instead of against it.\nRises or declines over 45%. Only in a bull market with an upward\nbreakout does the pattern begin to shine.

Note that prices after an ABW breakout in a bear market drop at a\nsteeper slope than the rise in bull markets.\nTable 5.3 shows failure rates. How do you make sense of the numbers?\nLet me give you two examples. In a bull market with a downward breakout,\n11% of the patterns failed to drop more than 5%. In a bull market with an\nupward breakout, 10% failed to rise at least 10%.\nTable 5.3\nFailure Rates\nMaximum \nBull \nBear\nBull\nBear\nPrice Rise\nMarket, \nMarket, \nMarket, \nMarket,\nor Decline \nUp \nUp \nDown \nDown \n(%)\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\n5 (breakeven)\n1 or 2%\n0 or 0%\n19 or 11%\n3 or 14%\n10\n6 or 10%\n2 or 20%\n56 or 34%\n4 or 19%\n15\n13 or 22%\n5 or 50%\n84 or 51%\n7 or 33%\n20\n18 or 31%\n5 or 50%\n103 or 62%\n10 or 48%\n25\n25 or 43%\n6 or 60%\n127 or 77%\n13 or 62%\n30\n31 or 53%\n7 or 70%\n142 or 86%\n18 or 86%\n35\n35 or 60%\n8 or 80%\n145 or 87%\n18 or 86%\n50\n43 or 74%\n10 or 100%\n165 or 99%\n21 or 100%\n75\n51 or 88%\n10 or 100%\n166 or 100%\n21 or 100%\nOver 75\n58 or 100%\n10 or 100%\n166 or 100%\n21 or 100%\n",

Ignoring the small sample\ncounts for bear markets, the lowest failure rates occur in patterns with an\nupward breakout in a bull market.

It takes between 12 and 30 days before\nprice closes outside the trend-line boundary. That is an average, so your results\nwill vary. Upward breakouts take longer than downward ones to pierce the\ntrend line. This observation makes sense because the upper trend line has a\nsteeper slope and prices are rising along with the trend line. For downward\nbreakouts, the trend line slopes up but prices are falling.\nYearly position. Where in the yearly price range do ABWs occur? The\nbreakout usually happens near the yearly high except in a bear market with a\ndownward breakout, which shows more breakouts in the middle of the yearly\nrange.\nYearly position, performance. Mapping performance onto the yearly\nprice range, we find that the middle of the yearly price range performs better\nthan the other ranges. The exception is for ABWs with downward breakouts in\na bull market, but the sample size is small.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur about half\nthe time, and it takes the stock between 9 and 13 days to return to the break-\nout price.

When a partial rise occurs, prices drop\n17% after the breakout, on average, meeting the average decline for ABWs. \nIntraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises\nand declines—those that occur within the pattern but with prices that continue\ncrossing the pattern—occur, at most, 17% of the time. Thus, you should feel\nsafe trading a partial rise or decline. They get you into the trade before the\nbreakout and correctly predict the breakout direction (usually).

Since the bear market samples are few, look at the two bull market rows.\nOver half (52%) of upward breakouts do not reach the ultimate high before 70\ndays. Half of all downward breakouts will bottom in the first month (20 + 10 +\n14 + 7 = 51% in 28 days).

The measure rule for this formation is different from\nmost other formations in that it is based on the lowest low in the pattern, not\non the height of the formation (for downward breakouts only). Upward break-\nouts use the height from highest high to lowest low added to the highest high.\nThe result is the target price. The Results Snapshot lists the “Percentage meet-\ning price target” results.\nFigure 5.5 shows two ascending broadening wedges and application of the\nmeasure rule. Both formations are well formed, but the first one has a tendency\nto rise slightly above the top trend line before beginning its downhill run. The\nchart marks the lowest low in each formation. The low serves as the expected\nminimum price move. The formation on the left shows prices reaching the tar-\nget in mid-November just as prices turn around and rebound. The formation\nshown on the right has prices hitting the target when they plummet.\nThe reason for choosing the lowest low in the formation is simply for\nperformance. Using the formation low as the target price allows 58% to 86%\nof the formations to achieve the target. I like to see performance numbers\nabove 80%, so the 58% value is poor.

If you\nwait for a breakout before investing, you substantially increase your chances of\na profitable trade. Once prices decline below the lower trend line, sell the stock\nshort. Be prepared to cover the short as prices near the target, especially if the\nprice approaches an area of support.\nIn Figure 5.5, the lowest formation low on the left is also a support point.\nPrices decline to the low in early August then head up and create the formation.\nSeveral months later, prices decline to that level and turn around.

An exception to the wait for breakout-confirmation rule is if\na partial rise occurs. Looking again at Figure 5.5, you might conclude that\nthere is a partial rise in the right formation. Wrong. I define a partial rise as\nwhen prices touch the lower trend line, move up, then return to the lower\ntrend line. The figure shows prices starting from the top trend line, not the\nlower one.

Occasionally, he\nspots a situation such as that shown in Figure 5.5, one that makes the morning\nsun seem even brighter.\nEach day before he hit the sack, he plotted the stock and watched with\namusement as the first broadening wedge formed. When the second one\nappeared, he wiped the sleep from his eyes and took notice. It was not so much\nthe broadening wedge that excited him; it was the wedge coupled with the dou-\nble top. Together, they spelled an especially bearish situation, one that he was\nwilling to shell out his hard earned money to trade.\nThe day after the stock closed below the lower trend line, Curtis sold the\nstock short and received a fill at 39.50. He used the double top measure rule to\nestimate his target price. With a top at 45.75 and a valley low of 36.25, the target\nturned out to be 26.75 (that is 45.75–36.25 subtracted from 36.25). He decided to\nplace an order to cover the short at 27.13, just above the whole number and just\nabove where everyone else was likely to place theirs. Then he went to bed.\nEach day, before he closed the curtains to get some sleep, he would check\non his stock. To him, it was pleasing to see the stock begin moving down\nimmediately and sailing below the nearest broadening wedge target price\n(38.88). He lost some sleep worrying about the upward retrace in March, and\nwondered if the party were over.\nCurtis hung in there and the stock eventually pierced the resistance zone\nand kept moving down. He hoped that the March resistance was just the cor-\nrective phase of a measured move down, which would place the target price at\n22.50, well below his target at 27.13. He decided not to be greedy and lower \nhis target. \nOn April 18 he was rudely awakened from his REM state by a phone call\nfrom his broker. The short was covered at his target price. He made about $12\na share.

Even the measure rule changed (that is, the percent-\nage meeting the predicted price target). I used the formation height and added it\nto the breakout price to get the target.

There are a number of touches of the minor highs against the\ntop trend line and the minor lows against the bottom one. There should be at\nleast two distinct touches—two minor highs (top trend line) and two minor\nlows (bottom trend line)—to correctly define a broadening formation.\nVolume. The slope of the volume trend is usually upward, unlike forma-\ntions from the narrowing wedge family. The increasing volume pattern seems\nto catapult prices higher, sending them out the top of the formation. Volume\nat the breakout is usually high but need not be. As long as demand exceeds sup-\nply, prices will rise.\nBreakout. Just over half the time, the formation acts as a reversal of the\ntrend. Figure 6.2 shows an example. There is no easy way to differentiate a\nbudding consolidation from a reversal. Only the breakout direction decides\nwhich is which.\nPartial decline. The partial decline, such as that shown in Figure 6.3,\noften indicates an impending upward breakout. This works quite well for con-\nsolidations or reversals. \nWhy do these formations form? The chart pattern, as do many forma-\ntions, illustrates the struggle between supply and demand.

At those points, prices are some-\nwhat more likely to stage a rebound. That is what occurs in Figure 6.3. Prices rise\nfrom a low of 13.63 to a high of 18.88.

However, once the stock approaches the 62% retrace level\n(15.63), the smart money knows the jig is up. They start buying heavily for the 5\ndays surrounding the new year.

Prices touch the top trend line then head toward the lower trend line,\ncurl around, and stage an upward breakout. In a bull market, a partial decline\nprecedes an upward breakout 87% of the time. Partial rises do not fare as well\nbecause of the low sample counts.\nWhen a partial rise or decline happens, does performance suffer? Yes and\nno. For upward breakouts, patterns having a partial decline show improved\nperformance. For downward breakouts, a partial rise hurts the postbreakout\ndecline, but that may change with more samples.\nIntraformation partial rises and declines. Intraformation partial rises\nand declines look like normal partial rises and declines, but prices continue\ncrossing the pattern instead of breaking out.

If you are considering buying the stock shown in\nFigure 6.5, it is not obvious at first that a broadening wedge is forming. Over\ntime, once enough minor highs and lows appear, draw the two trend lines.\nThen, it becomes a matter of waiting for a breakout. Since most descending\nbroadening wedges break out upward, that is the way to trade it. Wait for\nprices to close above the top trend line before buying.\nPartial decline. An exception to the rule about waiting for confirmation\nis the partial decline. As prices move down from the top trend line, watch them\nclosely. If prices reach a support zone and begin moving up, buy because that\nis a partial decline, and it usually signals an impending upward breakout. Place\na stop 0.15 below the curl low, just in case.\nTrade the trend lines; stops. If the formation is especially wide, try an\nintraformation trade. Buy at the lower trend line and sell at the top one, or sell\nshort at the top and cover near the bottom. With the trend lines sloping down-\nward, a short sale will be more profitable. Use a stop 0.15 beyond the appro-\npriate trend line in case of an adverse breakout. Adjust your stop as prices\nmove in your favor.

Even better, the stock moves lower for several\ndays, reinforcing her sell decision.\nIt turns out that she sold too soon, but she does not care.

She leans back in her chair, smiles and mumbles something about luck,\nthen runs to the VCR and plugs in another Dirty Harry movie.\nThis trade shows the problem with placing a sell order at the price target.\nYes, Mary sold at a good price, but if she had used the stop-loss order to take\nher out, she probably would have made more. To let your profits run, raise the\nstop price, placing it slightly below the prior minor low, and raise it to the next\nhigher minor low when prices climb to a new high. Eventually, prices will\ndecline and your position will be sold. However, this gives the stock every\nopportunity to continue making new highs.\nFor sophisticated traders, compute the average daily trading range of the\nstock over the prior month and set a stop no closer than 1.5 times the average.\nFor example, if the stock has a daily trading range of $2, set the stop no closer\nthan $3 below the current daily low. If a minor low is $2.25 below the current\nlow, it is too close to use as a stop-loss point. Select one farther away.

      "text": "More than a year after I discovered the bump-and-run reversal (BARR) top, I\ndecided to look for its complement: the BARR bottom. The reasoning is sim-\nple. Many formations, such as double tops, ascending triangles, and triple tops\nall have bottom versions. Why not the bump-and-run reversal? It never\ndawned on me to look for the formation before then. As I searched through the\ndata looking for candidates, I was skeptical that the formation added real value.\nSome looked like cup-with-handle formations with the handle coming first,\nwhereas others looked like rounding bottoms. Only after I compiled the sta-\ntistics did my thoughts change.\nThe pattern is a strong performer with postbreakout gains between 31%\nand 38%. The break-even failure rate is small, coming in at 2% or less. The\npattern also has a few surprises but ones we have seen before: A throwback\nhurts postbreakout performance, and patterns both tall and wide perform bet-\nter than short and narrow ones. \nTour\nWhat is a bump-and-run reversal, anyway? If I had to name this formation\nindependent of all others, I would probably call it the frying pan or spoon for-\nmation because that is what it looks like. However, the formation is just a\nBARR top flipped upside down, so I call it a BARR bottom. I guess a more\naccurate description is an inverted BARR. \nWhy do BARR bottoms occur? Like the top version, the BARR bottom\nis a study of momentum. Consider the chart shown in Figure 7.1 on a weekly\nscale. Since late 1991, the stock was moving sideways—a trading range between\n6.50 and 11. However, that changed during the last week of October 1993,\nwhen the stock moved up and closed higher than the prior week. At first, this\ndid not seem unusual since many weeks close higher than the prior week, but\nthis one was different. It initiated a long climb to the highs of early January. On\nthe highest volume that the stock had seen in years, the stock hit a new high of\n14.38 during the week of January 14, 1994. Volume began tapering off, although\nit was still high, and prices tagged a much smaller peak during the week of\nMarch 25, at 14. The two minor highs, one in mid-January and another in late\nMarch, formed the basis of a down-sloping trend line.\nAs weekly volume trended lower, so did enthusiasm for the stock. Eventu-\nally, bullish sentiment could not sustain the high price and the stock collapsed.\nAs it headed down, volume continued to taper off. The upward momentum\nexperienced during the rise to the highs in January was now working against the\nstock. Over the course of a year, the stock gave back all its gains and, by mid-\nFebruary 1995, it started sinking to new lows.\nHigh volume a month later was key as it signaled a turning point. A week\nlater, again on high volume, the stock closed higher by over 10%. The upward\nmove had begun but soon stalled out. The stock moved sideways for another 2\n116\nBump-and-Run Reversal Bottoms\n",

The duration of the lead-in should be at least a\nmonth, but varies depending on the situation.\nBump phase\nThe bump is analogous to the frying pan base. The down-\nsloping trend line deepens to 60 degrees or more. Prices drop\nrapidly then level out and turn around, usually forming a\nrounded turn. After the turn, prices move up and sometimes\npause at the 30-degree trend line before moving higher. The\nbump height, as measured from the trend line to the lowest\nlow, should be at least twice the lead-in height.

As he flipped through his stock charts one day, he\nnoticed an intriguing situation developing in the stock depicted in Figure 7.6.\nDuring August, the stock peaked, declined a bit, then formed a second minor\nhigh. As the stock declined from the second high, John drew a tentative trend\nline down connecting them. Soon, he noticed that the stock was descending in\na sort of channel. He drew a second trend line, parallel to the first, that con-\nnected the lows.\nHowever, the stock soon pierced through the second trend line and\nmoved lower. When it declined even further, John thought he recognized a\nBARR bottom forming. He drew a third trend line, parallel to the other two\nand lead-in height apart.\nAs the stock dipped below the lowest trend line, he believed that the\ndecline was at an end. So, the following day he pulled the trigger and bought\n100 shares at 18.25. He was pleased to acquire the stock a bit below the clos-\ning price for the day.\nFor the next week, the stock shot upward and pierced the second trend\nline.

      "text": "When the stock neared the top trend line, John calculated the target\nprice, using the old method instead of the highest high in the pattern. He\ncomputed the lead-in height by subtracting the daily low from the trend line at\nits widest part in the first quarter of the formation. He used the low of August\n20, at 24, and subtracted this from the trend line value of 26, measured verti-\ncally. This left him with a lead-in height of $2. John believed that the stock\nwould likely break out at about 21.25, so this gave him a target price of 23.25,\nwhich is the lead-in height added to the breakout price.\nJohn was confident that he could hold out for larger gains. From his pur-\nchase point, he calculated that he would receive at least a 25% return if every-\nthing worked out as planned.\nFor about a month, the stock moved sideways, but this did not alarm him.\nHe even expected the stock to decline a bit and recapture some of its quick\ngains. Secretly he hoped that the stock would soon break out of its trading\nrange and head higher. He was confident that it would move up—it was only a\nquestion of when.\nHe was wrong. Indeed, the stock did break out of its trading range, but it\nheaded lower, not higher. After it approached the top trend line, the stock con-\ntinued down and touched the middle trend line. John knew that a stock often\nretraces 38% to 62% of its gains. He grabbed his calculator and computed the\nretrace value.\nThe stock reached a high of 21.43 in a straight-line run from the low at\n18, a rise of about 3.50 points. Now the stock was retracing the gains and had\nmoved down to 18.75, a 78% retrace. Clearly, this was out of the realm of a\nsimple retrace. John suspected that a trend change had occurred, but hoped\nthat the pause he was seeing as it touched the middle trend line would give the\nstock support and call an end to the decline. For a while, it did. The stock\npaused for 3 days at the trend line then started moving lower again. It quickly\nfell below the purchase price and headed down.\nAlthough John had purchased the stock as a short-term play, he con-\nvinced himself that he really liked the company and would not mind holding it\nfor the long term. Now, at least, that is what it would take for him to recoup\nhis losses and get out at breakeven.\nThe stock moved through the third trend line, heading lower. The easy\ngame was now turning into a disaster. John first considered selling on Decem-\nber 11, when the stock reached 12.75, for a 30% loss. He delayed the selling\ndecision by saying that the holding was a long-term one and he should expect\nto come across such declines in the short term.\nThe next day, the stock closed higher, and it gave him renewed hope.\nIndeed, it closed even higher the following day. But the 2-day recovery was an\nillusion and the stock declined again. As it plunged below 12.75, John threw up\nhis hands and told his broker to dump the dog. He received a fill at 12.25, the\nlow for the day. Two days later, the stock bottomed out at about 10.75. From\nthe buy point, John lost 35%.\nSample Trade\n129\n",

That is the problem I was researching when I\ndiscovered the bump-and-run reversal top formation. I was trying to figure out\na reliable way to determine if tomorrow’s price would be higher or lower than\ntoday’s and by how much.\nI tried all sorts of mathematical games to boost the accuracy of the pre-\ndiction with only limited success. Then I moved to the visual world. I drew a\ntrend line along a stock chart and wondered if I could determine how far prices\nwould decline below the line. I looked at many stock charts and trend lines try-\ning to see if there was a relationship between a trend line and the breakdown\nof the trend. That is when I discovered it: the bump-and-run formation—\nBARF for short. I toyed with the idea of leaving the name as is but decided that\nthe investment community would not believe the veracity of the new forma-\ntion. So, I changed the name to bump-and-run reversal (BARR), a slightly\nmore descriptive and palatable acronym.\nTour\nAs I looked at the various trend lines, I discovered that pronounced break-\ndowns share several characteristics. Look at Figure 8.1, a good BARR example.\nThe overall formation reminds me of a mountain range. The foothills at the\nstart of the formation are low and subdued, not venturing too far above the up-\nsloping plain. Volume at the start of the formation is high but quickly recedes.\nThe mountains themselves rise well above the foothills on high volume.\nInvestor enthusiasm continues as prices round over at the top, then diminishes\non the far side. When the mountains end, prices decline sharply and continue\nmoving down. That is a BARR. Prices bump-up, round over, and run back\ndown again. The formation is the visual representation of momentum. The\nbase of the formation follows a trend line that always slopes upward. It signals\ninvestors’ eagerness to acquire the stock. As each day goes by, investors bid\nhigher to reluctant sellers and the price rises.\nOther momentum players eventually notice the rise in the stock price.\nMany jump on the bandwagon the day after a surprisingly good earnings\nannouncement. That is when the bump begins. Volume spikes upward along\nwith the stock price. Quickly rising prices entice others to join the fray \nand that, in turn, sends the stock even higher. As momentum increases, \nprices jump to form a new, higher-sloping trend line. Then things start go-\ning wrong.\nSupply catches up with demand. As that happens, the rise slows and the\nsmart money turns cautious. Investor enthusiasm wanes and the war between\nsupply and demand turns. The stock rounds over and starts heading down.\nTour\n133\n",

In the figure, a trend line drawn below the lows in the\nstock extends until it intersects prices as they decline in May. Volume is high\nat the start of the pattern and the trend is up. That is a key consideration:\nPrices must be rising. The trend line should be approximately 30 degrees, but\nthe degree of slope depends on the scaling used to view the chart. If the trend\nline is flat or nearly so, it is not a good BARR candidate. A rising trend line shows\ninvestor enthusiasm for the stock. However, the trend line should not be too\nsteep either. Steep trend lines (over 60 degrees or so) do not allow enough\nroom for the bump to complete properly.\nLead-in, lead-in height. The first part of the formation, called the lead-\nin phase, leads to the bump phase. The lead-in phase should be at least 1 month\nlong and usually falls in the 2- to 3-month range, but can be considerably\nlonger. Prices oscillate up and down in this phase and have a range of at least $1\nas measured from the highest high to the trend line. This range, called the lead-\nin height, is calculated using prices from the first quarter of the formation.\nFigure 8.1, for example, shows that the highest high during the first quar-\nter of the formation occurs on January 12, 1994, at 25.63.

The trend line usually rises at about\n30–45 degrees (although this varies with scaling). Avoid trend\nlines that are too steep (over 60 degrees): There is not enough\nroom for the bump.\nLead-in, lead-in height\nThe lead-in is the section just before prices move up sharply in\nthe bump phase. Lead-in prices should have a range of at least\n$1 (preferably $2 or more), as measured from the highest high\nto the trend line, vertically, during the first quarter of the\noverall formation length. Minimum lead-in length is 1 month\nwith no maximum value.\nRounded bump\nPrices rise up (trend line slope is 45–60 degrees or more) on\nhigh volume usually after a favorable event (unexpectedly good\nearnings, an analyst recommends or upgrades the stock, higher\nstore sales, that sort of thing). Prices eventually round over and\ndecline back to the 30 degree trend line. The bump must be at\nleast twice the lead-in height, measured from highest high to\nthe trend line, vertically.\nDownhill run\nAfter returning to the trend line, prices may bounce back up\nand form additional bumps or slide along the trend line.

Prices jump up at the bump start and quickly rise from\na low of 26.50 to a high of 34.38 during late March. Volume remains high\nthroughout this period then quickly tapers off as prices round over at the top.\nMany times, the top takes on the appearance of a head-and-shoulders forma-\ntion or a double or triple top. If you recognize any of these formations on your\nchart, ignore the BARR top formation and obey the implications of the indi-\nvidual formations.\nThe bump height, as measured from the highest high to the trend line,\nshould be at least twice the lead-in height. In this example, the bump height is\n8 (that is, 34.38–26.38). This is more than twice the lead-in height of 1.38.\nThe reason for the minimum two-to-one ratio is arbitrary. The idea is to\nmake sure that investor enthusiasm and, hence, momentum are getting carried\naway. An up-sloping trend line that turns into a bump with a higher sloping\ntrend line emphasizes the rising momentum. Sustaining such unbounded\nenthusiasm for too long is difficult and the stock price eventually declines. In\nFigure 8.1, that is exactly what happens. Prices round over and start heading\ndown. Sometimes the decline is orderly and sometimes it is choppy. In nearly\nall cases, prices return to the trend line. Once there, the stock may do several\nthings. Fairly often prices bump up again, and that is called a BARR with a dual\nbump or a dual BARR. Occasionally, a dual BARR consists of several bumps\nbut the result is still the same. Prices eventually fall below the trend line.\nDownhill run. Sometimes prices slide up along the trend line for a\nmonth or so before continuing down. At other times, prices drop straight\nthrough the trend line, turn around and climb again, before ultimately drop-\nping. In a few rare cases, prices descend from the bump high and never make\nit back to the trend line before moving higher. These cases commonly appear\non weekly or monthly price charts.\n136\nBump-and-Run Reversal Tops\n",

Table 8.2 shows the performance num-\nbers for busted patterns, but few occur, so the numbers are likely to change.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change. In a bull market, the S&P 500 index\nclimbed 8%, and in a bear market, the index dropped 11%. Notice how a\nstrong bear market helped the average BARR decline 27%.\nDays to ultimate low. In a bull market, it takes just over 2 months (68\ndays) to reach the ultimate low, but in a bear market, the drop takes 39 days.\nThus, patterns in a bear market have prices that drop farther in less time, mean-\ning a steeper decline. This finding suggests that if you own a stock with a BARR\ntop and prices confirm by closing below the trend line, sell immediately. Oth-\nerwise, the price riptide may drag your profitable position into a losing one.\nTable 8.3 lists failure rates for BARR tops. The failures start small, espe-\ncially in a bear market. Just one pattern, or 1%, fails to drop at least 5%. As one\nmight expect, the failure rates in a bear market are below those of the bull mar-\nket. Half the patterns in a bear market will fail to drop at least 25%. In a bull\nmarket, the halfway mark passes at about 18%, meaning half the patterns will\nfail to decline more than 18%. Compared to other bearish chart patterns, these\nfailure rates are small.\nOne way to use the table is with the measure rule. Later, in Trading Tac-\ntics I discuss the rule, but suppose it predicts a decline from 20 to 15, or 25%.\nHow likely is it that prices will actually decline that far? Table 8.3 shows the\nanswer. In a bull market, 73% will fail to drop at least 25% and in a bear mar-\nket, 59% will fail.

Two lines parallel to the trend line assist in that deter-\nmination. The first line, called the warning line, is lead-in height above the\ntrend line.

Long-term price charts were no help as the stock was making new highs\nalmost daily. Jenny shrugged her shoulders as there was no way to determine\nwhere the rise would stop. Her only guess was that it might pause at 35, 40, or\n45, price points where investors might decide to sell. Any one of those points\ncould turn the stock downward, she decided. Even the current 30 level might\nbe the highest price the stock sees.\nAfter her analysis was complete, she was still confident that the stock held\npromise of additional gains. As with any stock caught by upward momentum,\nthere was no telling how high the stock would climb before it stopped. She\ndecided to hang onto the stock. If the stock declined to the warning line, \nshe would sell it. She placed a stop-loss order at 27.50, the current value of the\nwarning line.\nDuring late September and into the start of October, the stock followed\nthe sell line upward. On October 12, the stock jumped upward again. After a\nweek or so, Jenny was able to draw another sell line parallel to the original\nBARR trend line that intersected stock prices. She decided that should the\nstock fall to the lower sell line, she would dump the stock. She raised her stop-\nloss point to 31. But the stock did not return to the lower sell line.\nThe stock reached a minor high of 34.38 on October 19, then retraced\nsome of its prior gains. It curled around and reached a low of 32.88 before\nturning around. Jenny printed out another price chart and drew a new trend\nline. This line had a slope of about 60 degrees. She smiled as the BARR was\nperforming exactly as predicted.\nDuring the first part of December, prices pierced the 60 degree trend line\nwhen the stock began moving sideways. Jenny suspected that the rise was nearly\nover, but one could never tell for sure until it was too late. She decided that should\nthe stock decline below the latest sell line, she would close out her position.\nThe stock moved up again. A few days after Christmas, the stock reached\na new high of 39.75 and Jenny was able to draw another sell line. During the\nnext 2 weeks, the stock declined to the lower sell line, then rebounded to chal-\nlenge its recent high. On January 15, it peaked at 39.88, a smidgen below the\n40 resistance number she estimated earlier.\nTo Jenny, the day looked like a one-day reversal, but she could not be sure.\nTaken together, the two highest points looked like a double top, but the reces-\nsion between them was not deep enough to qualify and the two peaks were a bit\ntoo close together. Still, it was a warning sign and it made her nervous.\nSample Trade\n147\n",

The higher left lip is a change from the first edition of this Encyclopedia\nwhere cups with a higher right lip performed better. I believe the difference is\nfrom the change in methodology and a larger sample size. \nTour\nThe cup-with-handle formation was popularized by William J. O’Neil in his\nbook, How to Make Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill, 1988). He gives a couple of\nexamples such as that shown in Figure 9.1. The stock climbed 295% in about 2\nmonths (computed from the right cup lip to the ultimate high). Unfortunately,\nit does not meet O’Neil’s criteria for a cup-with-handle formation. I discuss my\ninterpretation of his criteria in a moment, but let us first take a closer look at the\nchart pattern. The stock began rising in early August at a price of about 5.50 and\nclimbed steadily until it bumped up in early December. Volume, incidentally,\nwas very high for the stock at this stage. The stock climbed robustly then\nrounded over and plunged back through an earlier trend line. It completed a\nbump-and-run reversal (BARR). During its climb, the stock reached a high of\n26.88 during late December and a low of 12.38 after the BARR top—a loss of\n54%. The rise and decline formed the left side of the cup. Over the next 2\nmonths, prices meandered upward and pierced the old high during late March.\nThe rise to the old high completed the right side of the cup.\n150\nCup with Handle\nDiana Corp.

      "text": "In the first edition of this book, I applied as many of his guidelines as I\ncould and found that fewer than 10% of the patterns I considered valid cups\nwere chosen. Plus, the performance of the selected few was not as good as the\ncups I found using the Bulkowski guidelines shown in Table 9.1. For more\ninformation about the cup with handle pattern, consult O’Neil’s book. \nHere is a brief review of the guidelines I found important.\nRise before cup is at least 30%. As I was selecting cup-with-handle pat-\nterns, it became apparent that locating cups during an uptrend was important.\nSo I used O’Neil’s minimum rise to the left cup lip of 30%. To measure this,\nI applied the same method as for finding the trend start (see the Glossary for a\ndefinition) and reviewed those that fell short of 30%. If the trend start using\nthe mechanical method was shy (usually by just a few percentage points) of the\nrequired 30% but the price trend appeared longer on examination, I accepted\nthe pattern. Just 15 of 471 patterns (3%) were in this category.\nU-shaped cup, handle duration. I removed all V-shaped cups and kept\nthe U-shaped ones. I am not sure about the performance effect of this. Also\nremoved were those cups with handles shorter than 7 days (5 trading days). A\ncup without a handle is a rounding bottom. I considered the handle length as\nthe distance from the right cup lip to the breakout.\nCup duration. I used a strict interpretation of O’Neil’s cup duration.\nRemoved were short cups (fewer than 7 weeks) and overly long ones (over \n65 weeks). \nHandles form in upper half of cup. I used a more lax interpretation of\nwhere the handle forms on the cup. In other words, I visually inspected the\ncups to be sure prices in the handle drifted no lower than halfway down the\ncup. I removed those drifting lower (include all with downward breakouts).\nWhen measuring distance, use an arithmetic chart, not a semilogarith-\nmic chart.\nCup lips near same price. Finally, I selected cups with lips (tops) at\napproximately the same price level. Cups with uneven lips are better classified\nas scallops. I assign no hard percentages to the difference. Use your own judg-\nment and the figures in this chapter as guides.\nFigure 9.2 shows another good example of the cup-with-handle pattern.\nThe cup gently rounds over and climbs just beyond the old high then pauses.\nPrices drift down in the handle, along with a down-trending volume pattern\nbefore the breakout. Then volume surges and prices move smartly upward.\nTwo days after the breakout, prices move marginally lower again and enter\nthe region of the right cup lip. After a brief throwback, prices are soon on\ntheir way again. Less than 2 months later, the stock tops out at 15.50 for a \nrise of 22%.\nIf you look on either side of the cup in Figure 9.2 you will find two addi-\ntional cups (portions of which are shown) that fail.

In a bear market, only a third of the patterns will\nstill be climbing toward the high after 70 days.\nOn the other end of the scale, few patterns flame out early. Usually a\nquick rise to the ultimate high does not result in a large gain, so higher num-\nbers on the right of the table are a plus. The table shows that 15% of the cups\nin a bear market will top out in the first week. Half the patterns will drop at\nleast 20% before day 35. The 20% decline is part of the definition of the ulti-\nmate high. See the Glossary for more details on the ultimate high. \nTable 9.6 shows size-related statistics.\nHeight.

The traditional method involves determining the\nheight of the formation from lowest low in the cup to the high at the right cup\nlip.

However, this method only has a 50% success rate (half the formations\nreach their price targets in a bull market—fewer, 27%, in a bear market). For\na better target, compute the cup height and take half of it. Then continue as\nbefore. The stock reaches the new, lower-priced target 76% of the time in a\nbull market; 55% in a bear market.

The next two most common\nretrace amounts were 35% and 60%, respectively. All of these numbers are\nclosing in on their respective Fibonacci retrace values of 50%, 38%, and 62%.\nFor example, Figure 10.2 shows the retrace as the distance from B to D\ncompared to the distance from B to C.

In\na bull market, the best performing patterns have breakouts near the yearly low.\nIn a bear market, the middle of the range works best, but the sample count uses\n29 patterns. With additional patterns, the results may change.\nPullbacks. A pullback occurs about half the time. That is not often enough\nin which to formulate a trading plan (such as wait for the pullback before short-\ning).

Icups with gaps show improved performance after the breakout, but\nthe differences are slight. \nTable 10.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate low.

A quarter of the\npatterns in a bull market are still searching for the ultimate low after 2.5 months.\nNotice the slight rise in the number bottoming out at day 42 (bear mar-\nket) and 49 (bull market). Keep an eye out for a trend change 6 to 7 weeks after\nthe breakout.\nTable 10.6 shows size-related statistics.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform better than short ones. To use this obser-\nvation, compute the formation height by taking the difference between the top\nof the cup and the lower of the two rims and then divide by the price of the right\nrim low. If the result is higher than the median, the pattern is tall.\nWidth. Narrow patterns perform slightly better than wide ones. I used\nthe median length as the separator between narrow and wide.\nAverage formation length. Icups are wide beasts—about 4 to 5 months\nlong—on average. Icups in a bull market are narrower than in a bear market,\nbut the reason for this is not clear.\nHeight and width combinations. In both markets, icups that are both tall\nand narrow perform best.

Figure 10.6 shows the\ninverted cup-with-handle dealt her and how she traded it.\nThe first thing Sam did was to qualify the pattern. Did it meet the iden-\ntification guidelines listed in Table 10.1? Quickly running through them, we find\nthat price leading to the pattern was drifting down in a bull market. A down-\nward price trend was good as you want to trade with the trend, but it would have\nbeen better if the pattern appeared in a bear market. The cup looked rounded\nwith rims uneven but not too apart in price. The handle showed a distinct bump\nup but some distance from the cup. She did not know if this made any difference.\nThe handle retrace measured 69%, higher than the Fibonacci retrace of 62%. \nNext she reviewed the “For Best Performance” list to improve her odds of\na successful trade. Was a pullback likely? No (good), because there was no price\naction as far back as late 1992 and little underlying support in the two years\nbefore that. Was the pattern tall? No (bad). The pattern high was at 10.63, the\nlow at 8.13, and the breakout at 8.38. The result was 29.83%, just shy of the\n31.93% median, making the pattern short. Was the pattern wide?

Review the identification characteris-\ntics shown in Table 11.1. \nPrior price trend. Since we are dealing with diamond bottoms and not\ntops, the prevailing price trend is downward leading to the diamond. \nThe hardest part of identifying any pattern is seeing the shape prices make.\nFor diamonds, they are especially difficult to identify. However, they occur\nmany times at price turning points. Thus, look for diamond bottoms at the end\nof a downward price trend. Rarely, diamonds appear in the middle of the trend\nand prices continue lower instead of reversing.\nDiamond shape. When prospecting for diamonds look for prices to widen\nout over time forming higher highs and lower lows. The price pattern should\nlook like a broadening bottom chart pattern. Then, prices narrow, forming lower\nhighs and higher lows. The second half should look like a symmetrical triangle.\nIf you draw trend lines around the minor lows and highs, the result should\nappear diamond shaped. More likely, the diamond’s top or bottom will be\npushed to one side, making it appear as though the chart pattern is leaning over. \nVolume trend.

Sup-\nport meets prices that decline into the formation area, usually stopping briefly \nnear the breakout price, then prices turn around again and head back up. This\nthrowback to the formation happens more than half the time (53%) and rep-\nresents another opportunity to initiate a trade or add to a position. \nFigure 11.4 shows the last example of a diamond bottom. Does it obey the\nidentification characteristics from Table 11.1? Yes. The prevailing price trend\nis downward leading to the diamond. The minor highs and lows touch the asso-\nciated trend lines often enough except on the upper left facet. I scratched my\nhead drawing the slope of that edge because it does not have two minor highs\nto connect, but one (the top of the pattern). I connected the high of a day and\njoined up with the lower left trend line. Does that make it any less of a diamond?\nI will let you decide.\nThe volume trend slopes downward (very high on the left side and dimin-\nished on the right). Breakout day volume is high, too. \nThe diamond is also a head-and-shoulders bottom. I have marked the\ntwo shoulders (S) and head (H) to illustrate the pattern. The down-sloping neck-\nline is the trend line marking the right top of the diamond. Whether you con-\nclude it is a diamond bottom or a head-and-shoulders, the bullish implications\nare clear.

If you want to trade a diamond\nwith an upward breakout and it breaks out downward, you will simply look for\nanother trade. Thus, only 5% failures remain. These are when price breaks out\nof the pattern, moves in the intended direction, but stops and reverses direction\nbefore moving far.\nFigure 11.5 shows an example. Is this a valid diamond? Prices trend down-\nward into the pattern, the diamond shape is clear, but volume trends upward\n(higher on the right than the left). Is the rising volume trend cause for concern?\nNo. Breakout day volume is also low instead of high. Everything looks fine\nexcept for volume.

The job pays well, but he has many school loans\nand a mountain of dept. He thought of using his paycheck to keep ahead of the\nbills while depending on the bull market to furnish the luxuries.\nHe had his eye on a new stereo system and wanted it for a party he was\nhosting during the Fourth of July festivities. That did not leave him much time,\nso he searched for a chart pattern he could trade profitably. He chose the dia-\nmond bottom shown in Figure 11.6. Scott first noticed the diamond in May, a\nfew days before the breakout. He believed that the price would not decline below\n69.88, 0.12 below the round number of 70 and at the same level as a couple of\nprice peaks in January.\nRisking just $0.75 with a possible reward of $3.75 gave him a risk to reward\nratio of 1:5. If everything worked as planned, he would make a tidy sum, enough\nto buy the stereo.\nThe day after the stock broke out upward, he bought and received a fill at\n71.75 (near point C in Figure 11.6). That was higher than he liked, but with\nthe strength shown, he was sure the trade would work out. Scott dutifully\nplaced his stop-loss order at 69.88 with his broker. Three days later the stock\nclosed at 75, above the target price. He dropped by the music store just to fon-\ndle the knobs and flip the switches of his dream machine.\nThen things began going wrong. The stock closed down nearly $3 to 72.13.\nIt dropped to 71.38 the next day and made a lower low a day later. Suddenly,\nScott was losing money and his stereo pipe dream was in danger of plugging.\nShould he sell the stock and put off the party for another time?\nLuck was on his side and prices began climbing again. Soon, they were at\n74, but the honeymoon did not last long. Prices completed a symmetrical tri-\nangle but Scott did not see it. They broke out downward through the support\ntrend line (extend the lower right diamond diagonal toward the triangle). The\nstock even gave him another chance to get out at a profit when it attempted a\npullback to the triangle boundary. Scott was busy making party plans and missed\nthe signal. When he received a call from his broker in mid-June reporting that\nthe stop took him out at 69.88, Scott scratched his head and wondered what\nwent wrong. Do you know the answer?\nThe answer is greed. Since he needed money for a stereo, once prices\ncleared the top of the diamond, he should have put a limit order to sell at his\ntarget price. Although this technique limits the profit potential (because you\nget taken out even though the stock may double after that), it allows a trader\nto capture the turn near a high point. I have seen this behavior with event pat-\nterns. Prices shoot up, hit the target and then just as quickly decline. If you do\nnot sell, you lose your profit. An example from my own trading: A few days\nago, a stop-loss order sold my position in Rohm & Haas for a $113 profit in an\nearnings flag trade. If I used my profit target, I would have made $1,000. \n194\nDiamond Bottoms\n",

Yes.\nThe price trend leading to the pattern is up, there are plenty of trend line\ntouches in the pattern, and volume diminishes from being high on the left to low\non the right—all are ingredients of a properly selected diamond top. Breakout\nvolume, however, is timid, falling well short of the peaks posted during the\nprior three days. \nIs low breakout volume the reason why prices failed to descend far (just\n3%)? Maybe. A high volume breakout would have given more confidence to a\nbearish situation and perhaps prevented a pullback. I have noticed that high\nvolume downward breakouts pull back less often than do low volume ones.\nThis makes intuitive sense, as a high volume descent tends to push prices down\nfarther than a low volume one. \nPerhaps the key to this failure is like many others: Support below the pat-\ntern stops the decline. On the weekly chart (not shown), support appears in\nAugust 1996, February 1996, and May 1995, all with prices peaking near 17.\nCoupled with a bullish general market, the rising tide lifted all boats and pre-\nvented this one from sinking.\nBased on this chart, if this were my trade, I would have seen the support\nin July (point A) as a warning sign.

It ranges between 43 and 81 days, or about 6 to 11 weeks.\nNotice that prices in a bear market drop quicker than they rise in a bull market.\nTable 12.3 shows failure rates for diamond tops under varying breakout\ndirections and market conditions. I am sure your eye went first to the bear mar-\nket, up breakout with a 0% failure rate. Look down at the bottom of the col-\numn. I found only 28 patterns.

Bull markets do better when the breakout is\nin the middle of the yearly price range. Bear markets have too few samples to be\nusable. Upward breakouts do better near the yearly low, and downward break-\nouts do better near the yearly high.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. How often do prices throw back (upward\nbreakouts) or pull back (downward breakouts) to the diamond trend line bor-\nder or breakout price? Answer: about half the time.\nThe time to complete the throwback or pullback ranges between 9 and 13\ndays. When a throwback or pullback occurs, performance suffers, as Table 12.4\nshows. Thus, the key to selecting better performing patterns is to search for\nunderlying support or overhead resistance before investing. Nearby support or\nresistance may repel the downward or upward move, respectively.\nGaps. Across the board, gaps hurt performance. By gaps, I mean a price\ngap that occurs on the day price closes outside the pattern boundary (the break-\nout day). The average gap size varies from $0.40 to $0.91 depending on market\nconditions and breakout direction. Other chart patterns show larger gaps asso-\nciated with downward breakouts, but the small sample size may explain the large\ngap size in diamonds with upward breakouts in a bear market.\nTable 12.5 shows a frequency distribution of days to the ultimate high or\nlow. Notice how many diamonds reach the ultimate move in the first few weeks.\nFor example, in a bear market, 55% of those diamonds with downward break-\nouts top out in the first month. At the other end of the table, 13% are still\nsearching for the ultimate low after 70 days (about 2.5 months).\nAlso notice the slight blip around a month into the trade. In a bear market,\nup breakout, 11% of the diamonds top out after 35 days. Skipping down, 14%\nof diamonds in a bear market with downward breakouts bottom around day 42.\nIn fact, all patterns show a slight rise during days 35 or 42.

Add the difference (5.77) to the breakout price (C\nat 41.85, the point at which price pierces the diamond boundary) to get the\ntarget (47.62). Price reaches the target between 69% and 79% of the time. See\nthe Results Snapshot (“Percentage meeting price target”) for the numbers. In\nthis example, the diamond missed the target by falling short.\nHowever, there is an alternative method that sometimes yields more\naccurate results. The method involves looking at the price chart and seeing if\nthere is something to reverse. By this I mean diamonds sometimes form after\na quick run-up in prices. The reversal will usually erase these gains and return\nprices to where they were before the run-up.\nWait for breakout. When trading technical formations like diamond\ntops, it is always safest to wait for the breakout. If you do not wait for the\nbreakout, you may face a situation similar to that shown in Figure 12.4. Instead\nof reversing, prices resume their original trend and the investor, shorting\nbefore the breakout, takes a loss.\nRisk/reward. Before placing a trade, consider the risk/reward ratio. In\nessence, you first identify the support and resistance levels and calculate the\ndifference between those levels and the current price. Trades that result in risk/\nreward ratios of one to two or higher are worth making. With smaller ratios,\nthe risk may be too high to warrant a trade. \nSample Trade\nFigure 12.6 shows a diamond top Lorenzo traded. He first noticed the dia-\nmond well after it formed—during the throwback to be exact. The throw-\nback’s hooking pattern caught his attention, and he searched for a nearby chart\npattern. In this case, he saw a diamond top, but was it a valid diamond or just\ncubic zirconia?\nLorenzo reviewed the identification guidelines and found that prices were\nrising into the pattern, verifying a top. The diamond shape, although pushed\nto one side, had an adequate number of touches of each diamond boundary (the\ntrend lines). Volume receded from the middle of the pattern to the end, so it\nhad a downward trend. In fact, the entire volume shape appeared domed. Dome-\nshaped volume for diamonds in a bull market with an upward breakout was a\ndecent choice (not the best or worst; see Table 12.7). \nBreakout volume was high but nothing to write home about and well below\nthe peaks of a few days earlier. Prices also gapped upward, suggesting buying\nenthusiasm. However, he knew that breakout day gaps resulted in performance\nthat was not as good as those diamonds without gaps. That made him nervous.\nSince the breakout was upward, he checked for overhead resistance and\nsaw the long island in May. Prices tested the region at point D, leading to the\n210\nDiamond Tops\n",

Still, he knew that prices would eventually pierce such resistance\nzones, perhaps after multiple attempts to break through. \nHe computed the predicted price target using the diamond height pro-\njected upward from the breakout price and saw that the target was at the high\nend of the resistance zone. Thus, it looked likely that prices would throw back\nthere. That meant watching the stock closely and selling when it neared the\ntarget to maximize profits. On the down side, if prices dropped, he would close\nout his position just below the diamond bottom (point B). \nTwo days after prices closed the gap in the throwback, he bought and\nreceived a fill at 43. In the days that followed, the stock dropped, and he knew\nfrom experience that many of his trades either did well immediately or fell\napart. This looked as if it were going to result in a loss. He placed a stop-loss\norder to sell at 37.93. That was below the round number support at 38 and just\nbelow the diamond bottom.\nPrices climbed. When they closed above the prior minor high, point D,\nhe raised his stop to just below point E, a nearby minor low. Prices continued\nhigher for two more days then retraced their gains, attempted another high\n(point F) and then started a long slide. \nFrom experience, Lorenzo knew that a failure of price to make a higher\nhigh (at point F) was a bearish sign, but he hoped price would rebound. It did\nnot. Instead, price gapped down and tripped his stop. The stock sold at 40.98,\nfor a 5% loss.\nWhat did he do wrong? I would not have taken this trade because of the\noverhead resistance. Since there are plenty of chart patterns in other stocks\nunder more promising circumstances, why take one with high risk and limited\nprofit potential? On the plus side, he used a stop-loss order and raised it as\nprices climbed. Eventually, the order took him out for a small loss. That is the\nway it should work when a trade goes bad.

Narrow bottoms signify the Adam variety and wide bottoms sig-\nnify the Eve variety. \nRise between bottoms. Look for a rise between the twin bottoms of at\nleast 10%, as measured from the lowest bottom low to the highest high between\nthe two bottoms.

In a bear market, the decline gives up\nall the gains and more. \nFor aggressive traders in a bear market, wait for prices to peak then short\nthe stock and ride it down. The trick, of course, is to buy just after it peaks. How\ncan you tell when the stock peaks? Look for topping patterns that break out\ndownward in other stocks, especially those in the same industry. A strong mar-\nket downturn is also helpful. Or, trade a busted pattern.\nBusted pattern performance. Busted patterns have good bearish perfor-\nmance but the samples are few.

Answer: about 4 months in a bull market and 3.5 months in a bear market.\nTable 13.3 lists failure rates. AADBs have single-digit break-even failure\nrates that climb as the maximum price rises. For example, 5% of the patterns in\na bull market fail to rise at least 5% after the breakout. Over a quarter (26%) rise\nless than 15% in a bull market and 35% fail to rise at least 15% in a bear market.\nHalf the patterns top out after gains of just over 25% in a bull market and 20%\nin a bear market.\nPerhaps the biggest surprise is how quickly the failure rates climb. In a bull\nmarket, they triple from 5% to 17%. Bear markets double from 7% to 15% and\nthen double again to 35% as the maximum price climbs 5%, 10%, and 15%.\nThe table gives you some idea how typical double bottoms work.

That is a 30% move. How many patterns will rise at least that\nfar? Answer: 32% (68%, on average, will fail to make it that far).

First he qualified the pattern as a true double bottom\nby reviewing the identification characteristics listed in Table 13.1. Briefly, the\nstock started down in early January after a long-term uptrend that began in\nFebruary 1995. The twin bottoms were narrow with one-day downward spikes.\nThe rise between bottoms measured 29%; the bottom lows were 1% apart in\nprice and separated by 64 days. Oddly, the right bottom showed higher volume.\nHe placed an order to buy the stock at the confirmation price. Thus, he would\nget in at a good price and received a fill at 20.\nThe stock struggled by moving sideways for a week then achieved liftoff.\nPrice climbed until early June when it started retracing. The retrace turned\ninto a throwback when price pierced the confirmation line at 20. Prices moved\nup again and retraced, forming the handle of a cup-with-handle pattern. Randy\ndrew a down-sloping trend line along the handle, and the day after price closed\nabove the trend line, he bought more, receiving a fill at 22.73.\nHe computed the target price for the AADB (24.50, see the “Measure rule”\nin Table 13.8) and smiled when prices passed that, moving up. Then, he drew\nan up-sloping trend line following the contours of the handle (called the “Sell\nTrendline” in Figure 13.6). He vowed to sell the day after price closed below the\ntrend line, which it did in late November (not shown), and he received a fill at\n32. That was down considerably from the high at 38.19, but he made 60% on\nhis first trade and 41% on the cup-with-handle trade.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select Adam & Adam\ndouble bottoms that perform better after the breakout.

Most of the time, the breakout is in the middle of the range in a bull\nmarket and near the yearly low in a bear market.\nYearly position, performance. Mapping performance onto the yearly\nprice range shows that the best performance comes from patterns with breakouts\nnear the yearly high. A double bottom with a breakout near the yearly high—\nsounds like the best performers take place in an upward price trend like that\nshown in Figure 14.2.\nThrowbacks. The next several rows in Table 14.4 concern throwbacks. Just\nover half the time price throws back to the confirmation price. To complete the\nthrowback, it takes price 9 or 10 days. An interesting finding is that a throwback\nhurts performance. Thus, look for overhead resistance before trading a stock.\nGaps. Breakout day gaps hurt performance in a bull market but help it in\na bear market. However, the numbers are close, so they may be likely to change. \nTable 14.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high as\nmeasured from the breakout date. For example, 23% of AEDBs in a bear mar-\nket and 12% in a bull market reach the ultimate high in the first week. In two\nweeks’ time, 27% and 17%, respectively, will have topped out (that is the first\ntwo columns with numbers added together). \nNotice the increase in bear market patterns topping out just over a month\nafter the breakout. Thus, if you see upward momentum soften then, consider\nselling. The softness may indicate a trend change.\nTable 14.6 shows size statistics. \nHeight. Tall patterns outperformed short ones in both markets. To use\nthis finding, compute the formation height from the highest high to the lowest\nlow in the pattern and divide by the breakout price (the highest high). Compare\nthe result to the median.

In both bull and bear markets, patterns\nwith volume heavier on the left bottom than on the right performed better after\nthe breakout. \nTrading Tactics \nAs a bullish chart pattern, you need only know when to buy to trade AEDBs.\nSelling is, of course, the tough part. Before you buy, consider the trading tac-\ntics shown in Table 14.8.\nThe Measure rule. The measure rule predicts the minimum price move\nexpected once a double bottom experiences an upward breakout. Consider the\nchart pictured in Figure 14.6. To calculate the predicted price, first determine\nthe formation height by subtracting the lowest low from the highest high in the\nformation. In Figure 14.6, the lowest low occurs at the right bottom, with a\nprice of 27.57. The highest high, marked on the figure by point A, is 31.09.\nAdd the difference, 3.52, to the confirmation point, or the highest high\nbetween the two bottoms (that is, 31.09 + 3.52). Again, the highest high is\npoint A. The result, 34.61, is the expected minimum target. You can see in the\nchart that prices meet the target in late December. A few days after meeting\nthe target, prices momentarily descend before resuming their climb. During\nmid-April, the stock reaches its ultimate high price of 40.26 before declining.\nAfter you locate a potential double bottom, review the selection guide-\nlines before placing a trade. Figure 14.6 shows a declining price trend leading\nto the first bottom. The rise between the two bottoms is about 13%, just above\nthe 10% threshold.

However, she resisted the temptation\nto get in early because she could not guarantee prices would continue moving\nup. She justified her action by pretending that she was teaching her students\nhow to trade. If she could not do it properly, how could they?\nWhen prices reached the high between the two bottoms, Lauren decided\nto buy. Just before she placed her order, the broker read off the current quota-\ntion. It was well above the confirmation point. So she decided to wait and pray\nfor a throwback.\nAbout 4 weeks after the breakout, prices dipped to the buy point, but\nwould they continue down? She had to wait until she felt confident that prices\nwould rise. To her, this occurred a day later, on November 27. That day prices\nmade a higher low and she felt comfortable buying the stock. It was a gamble,\nbecause 2 days of rising prices hardly make a trend.

The Eve bottom caused him con-\ncern as the twin spikes were long but separated by a few days. Was that really\nan Adam bottom? The Adam bottom had a shorter spike. Was it an Eve bottom?\nHe looked above the spikes and saw that the Eve bottom was several weeks wide\nbut the Adam bottom remained narrow. He concluded that the pattern was an\nEADB. The rise between bottoms was over 10% and the bottoms looked to be\nabout 6 weeks apart. Volume was higher on the left bottom than the right,\nspelling good news for performance. \nAs he watched the pattern develop, he saw what looked like a head-and-\nshoulders bottom. He drew in the down-sloping neckline and when price closed\nabove it, confirming the head-and-shoulders bottom, he bought and received\na fill at 11. After that, it took just 2 days for price to confirm the EADB. \nWillie rode the stock higher and the price took on the shape of an ascend-\ning scallop—a rounded turn with a right handle. When the second, higher scal-\nlop appeared, he grew concerned. Sometimes, consecutive ascending scallops\nget narrower as they appear higher in the price trend.

That is the ideal pattern, but few look like that in the real\nworld. Of the four varieties of double bottoms, the Eve & Eve double bottom\n(EEDB) has the highest average rise—40%—in a bull market. Not only that,\nbut it has a low break-even failure rate: 4% What more could a trader want?\nTour\nWhat does an EEDB look like? Figure 16.1 shows a good example of the twin\nEve bottom. This EEDB forms after a broadening bottom chart pattern. The\ntwo Eve bottoms are wide, rounded, and distinct lows separated so that they are\nnot part of the same congestion region. The rise between the two bottoms in this\nexample measures an unusually large 40%. In March, price closes above the\nhighest high in the pattern, confirming the twin bottom as a true double bottom.\nWhy does a double bottom form? All chart patterns show the struggle\nbetween buying demand and selling pressure. When the price drops to a point\nwhere traders view the stock as a steal, they buy. If enough buy, the stock moves\nup in price. That is why the bottom usually shows a volume spike or high vol-\nume. In an EEDB, selling pressure balances buying demand, making the bottom\nturn long and gentle.\n260\nDouble Bottoms, Eve & Eve\nEve\nENSCO International (Oilfield Svcs/Equipment, NYSE, ESV)\nEve\nConfirmation Price\nThrowback\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n98\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan 99\nFigure 16.1\nA broadening bottom leads to an Eve & Eve double bottom.

      "text": "Prices rise and continue to rise until sellers, viewing the stock as over-\nbought, take profits. This selling pressure eventually stalls the upward move.\nWhen other traders see the upward momentum slowing, they dump their shares.\nThis selling forces the stock down again. \nWhen the price drops to a low enough level, the smart money accumulates\nshares again, sometimes quietly and sometimes not. Others see the slowing\ndownward price trend and predict a turn. They buy, too. \nAs price pulls out of its dive, more traders buy and the second Eve bottom\nforms as a gentle turn. Price begins climbing again. When it approaches the high\nbetween the two bottoms, it often stalls there as traders take profits. In a valid\nEEDB, the selling pressure does not send the price down again. Instead, traders\nsense the intrinsic strength and buy. This buying demand forces the price to tick\nupward, moving above the high between the two bottoms. That is the break-\nout signal. \nTechnical traders watching from the sidelines buy the stock in droves. Vol-\nume skyrockets along with the price. Reluctant sellers dump the stock to eager\nbuyers. The price climbs for several days and then things change. About half the\ntime, the price throws back to the breakout price. The throwback is brief before\nprice gathers strength and rises again, soaring to new highs. \nIdentification Guidelines\nI find that identifying EEDBs are easier than identifying birds, but, in both\ncases, you have to know what to look for. Not just any two bottoms at the same\nprice level will suffice for a double bottom. Listed in Table 16.1 are guidelines\nthat make correct selection easier. While considering the guidelines, look at\nFigure 16.2. \nDownward price trend. The stock begins declining in mid-October\n1993 from a price of about 56.50. It bottoms out at about 41.50 in mid-May.\nPrices never drop below the left low on the way to the bottom. The reason for\nthis guideline is that you should use the two lowest minor lows on the price\nchart. Do not try to select one low and then a nearby low just to satisfy the guide-\nlines. The two points marked A and B in Figure 16.2 represent an incorrectly\nselected double bottom because point A has lower lows to the left of it.\nBottom shape. Assign each double bottom pattern into its Adam or Eve\ncategory. Adam bottoms are narrow and V shaped, perhaps with a one- or two-\nday downward price spike. Eve bottoms are wide rounded turns. They may also\nhave price spikes, but they are usually shorter and more plentiful. \nRise between bottoms. The rise between the two bottoms should be at\nleast 10%, as measured from the lowest bottom low to the rise high.\nBottom low prices. The bottom to bottom price variation should be\nsmall. The basic rule is that two bottoms should appear to be near one another\non the price scale. Figure 16.2 shows a price variation of about 1%.\nIdentification Guidelines\n261\n",

      "text": "Bottom separation. The two bottoms should be at least a few weeks\napart but are often separated by many months, as shown in Figure 16.2. A\nmonth is the minimum separation that many professionals view as leading to\npowerful rallies. I set a lower standard to help verify that this is true. It turns\nout that peaks close together perform better than those spaced farther apart.\nPrice rise after right bottom. Prices should rise up to the confirmation\nprice without first making a third bottom. On average, it takes between 1 and\n2 months to complete the rise.\nBottom volume. The volume chart for double bottoms usually shows the\nhighest volume occurring on the left bottom. Diminished volume appears on the\nright bottom, and the volume trend of the overall formation is downward. None\nof these are absolute rules. Sometimes volume is highest on the right bottom in-\nstead of the left. However, on average most of the formations obey the guidelines.\nConfirmation price. The confirmation point is the highest high between\nthe two bottoms, and it is used to calculate the measure rule and to gauge the\nbreakout price (more about that later). Figure 16.2 shows a rise from the right\nbottom of 15%, above the 10% threshold.\nA double bottom is not a true double bottom until prices rise above the\nthe confirmation point. In tabulating the statistics, I only count those double bot-\ntom in which prices rise above the confirmation point. Why? Because of the high\nfailure rate: 64%. In one study, there were 980 formations that looked like dou-\nble bottoms, but their price trends eventually moved below the second bottom.\nAn additional 525 formations performed as expected by rising to the confir-\nmation point and continuing higher. If you buy a stock just after it touches the\nsecond bottom, your chances of having a successful trade are one in three. In\nother words, wait for prices to rise above the confirmation point.\nNow that you know what a double bottom looks like, let us discuss how\nto separate it into its proper Adam and Eve category. Figure 16.3 shows another\nexample of an EEDB but one harder to identify. Both bottoms have a one-day\ndownward spike. However, as you look up the bottom, prices widen. If you were\nto shave off that one day’s growth, you would have a rounding turn on both\nbottoms. Adam bottoms are narrower and usually longer. \nA good example of an Adam bottom occurs in December when prices\nplunge downward for three days. The bottom looks narrow and pointed, not\nwide and rounded. Notice the different appearance between the Adam and Eve\nbottoms. When trying to determine whether the double bottom has Adam or\nEve components, ask yourself if the two bottoms look similar (Adam & Adam\nor Eve & Eve) or different (Adam & Eve or Eve & Adam). If they look the same,\nare the bottoms wide or narrow, pointed or rounded? \nLet us look at another example, Figure 16.4. The first Eve bottom is nar-\nrower than the second one and it looks like a widely spaced horn (it has two\nminor lows). The right bottom looks wide but it is V shaped. Are these Adam\nbottoms?\nIdentification Guidelines\n263\n",

Thus, the reason the Eve & Eve\npattern failed to rise was overhead resistance coupled with a deteriorating fun-\ndamental picture.\nI like to know what is going on in the stocks I follow. I keep a database of\nevents and can match an event to the price action. The company released earn-\nings on both sides of the April/August price bump. The first release helped\npower prices up and the second helped take them down. During creation of the\nEve bottom, news appeared that machine tool orders were soft (down 2%)\nmonth-to-month and down 30% from the prior year. Coupled with increased\nforeign competition and insider selling, the fundamentals were going south.\nThat information did not help the technical picture. \nThe bump in price from April to the August Eve bottom reminds me of\nwhat sometimes happens to diamond tops. The price shoots up in a few days,\nforms a diamond top, and then tumbles back to where it started. From there, the\nstock flatlines as if it has lost its will to live.

In a bull market, for exam-\nple, the rise is 33% when a throwback occurs, and 48% without a throwback.\nThis finding suggests you should look for overhead resistance and avoid any\nsituations that might cause price to be repelled.\nGaps. Breakout day gaps marginally help performance in a bull market\nbut hurt it in a bear market.

This finding suggests you\nplace a buy order slightly below the breakout price so that it, hopefully, will get\nyou in before the actual breakout.\nTable 16.5 shows a frequency distribution of days to the ultimate high. Few\npatterns fail (top out) in the first week, but look at the bear market row, columns\n35 and 42 days. In those 2 weeks, 20% of the EEDBs in a bear market reach the\nultimate high. Thus, you should expect price to peak in just over a month after\nthe breakout. Bull markets show weakness in weeks 3 and 4 (days 21 and 28 in\nthe table). For some reason, this weakness occurs regularly in bear market chart\npatterns (of all types). \nTable 16.6 shows statistics related to size. \nHeight.

If the result is smaller than the median\nlisted in Table 16.6, then you have a short pattern.\nWidth. I measured the pattern width from lowest low in the left bottom\nto the right bottom low.

      "text": "As shown in Table 16.3, EEDBs show small break-even failure rates, providing\nyou wait for confirmation.\nThe exception to this rule is if you see a flat shelf near the right bottom.\nThe shelf is a price congestion area and sometimes it may take the form of\nanother chart pattern. Figure 15.6 in the prior chapter shows an example of this\nsituation. Buy when price moves above the congestion and put a stop on the far\nside of the support area (that is, below the shelf).\nTrade with market trend. Let the smart money trade against the pre-\nvailing trend. You should follow in their footsteps once they have cleared a\npath through the landmines. In other words, trade with the general market\ntrend. Buy bullish chart patterns (like EEDBs) in a rising stock market. Avoid\nthem in a bear market.\nCheck others in the industry. If other stocks in the same industry are\ndoing well, then that bolsters the case that your EEDB will break out upward,\nreversing the downward price trend. If other stocks in the industry are show-\ning bullish bottoming patterns or if their stock prices are rising, then trade the\nEEDB. If prices in other stocks are breaking down, making lower lows, then look\nelsewhere for a more promising situation. Double bottoms are plentiful. Keep\nsearching.\nSample Trade\nNot all chart pattern trades work as expected, and Figure 16.6 shows an exam-\nple. To be sure we are dealing with a valid EEDB, let us run through the iden-\ntification characteristics. Is the price trending downward to the pattern? Yes.\nAlthough the figure shows a high in mid-January (B), the stock crested back in\nmid-November 1999 (not shown).\nDo both bottoms resemble an Eve bottom? The shape appears rounded\nin both bottoms. The left bottom comprises two minor lows, but if you exclude\nthe first minor low (shown as point A), the Eve assessment does not change.\nThe rise between the bottoms is 29%, and the bottoms are 4% apart in\nprice and 18 days distant (measured from lowest low to lowest low). This is one\nof the narrower Eve bottoms, but it is still in the 2 to 7–week optimum range.\nVolume is higher on the right bottom than the left in a bear market. This obser-\nvation suggests slightly better postbreakout performance, but does not guaran-\ntee it. Price rises up to the confirmation price without first dropping below the\nright bottom low. The pattern is a valid EEDB.\nWhat happened after the breakout? Prices climbed enough to clear the\nconfirmation line then threw back and continued down. The stock reached a low\nof 4.24, recovered, and then dropped more, bottoming at 2.02 in February 2003.\nIf you bought at the breakout price and sold at the highest high, you would have\nmade 9%, without deducting commissions or other trading costs. Average\ntraders would have lost money, perhaps a lot of it if they rode the stock down.\nSample Trade\n273\n",

      "text": "What went wrong? Is this another case of overhead resistance? No. This\nis a case where the fundamentals take center stage. See that large gap on the left\nof the chart? Ten days before the gap, a brokerage downgraded the stock. The\nstock dropped, sure, but it hardly noticed the downgrade.\nOn November 29, when the market was closed, the company announced\nthat it would not meet its previous sales projections. When the stock opened the\nfollowing day, price gapped lower, closing 36% below the prior close. In short,\nthe stock dead-cat bounced; the bounce phase was the rounding turn before the\nEEDB (point B).\nA brokerage firm rated the stock “outperform” on the day it gapped lower.\nSuch positive statements after a large down gap help drive the price higher in\nthe bounce phase. However, the dire situation eventually catches the hype and\nthe stock sinks . . . sometimes dramatically, like that shown here.\nThus, even though we had a valid EEDB, the fundamentals were scream-\ning sell. I do not recommend taking a position in a stock showing a dead-cat\nbounce for at least 6 months, sometimes even up to a year. Many chart patterns\nduring that time look promising but fail to perform as expected. This is one\nexample.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select EEDBs that\nperform better after the breakout. Consult the associated table for more\ninformation.\n• Review the identification characteristics for correct selection—\nTable 16.1.\n• Trade EEDBs in a bull market—Table 16.2.\n• EEDBs show lower failure rates in bull markets than in bear ones—\nTable 16.3.\n• Select patterns with breakouts near the yearly low—Table 16.4.\n• Throwbacks hurt performance. Avoid EEDBs showing nearby over-\nhead resistance—Table 16.4.\n• Watch for the rise to stall 5 to 6 weeks after the breakout in a bear\nmarket—Table 16.5.\n• Choose narrow patterns—Table 16.6.\n• Pick patterns with a lower right bottom—Table 16.6.\n• Select patterns with volume heavier on the right bottom than the left—\nTable 16.7.\n274\nDouble Bottoms, Eve & Eve\n",

An Adam & Adam double top (AADT) is a twin-peak chart\npattern, but not just any two peaks will do. Adam peaks are narrow, inverted\nV’s, and sometimes have a long, one-day upward price spike. Volume is heav-\nier on the left top than the right—usually.\nThe Results Snapshot shows the performance results. Oddly, for a bearish\nchart pattern, AADTs perform better in a bull market than in a bear market,\njudging by the break-even failure rate. The average decline measures 19%\nregardless of market condition, which is also odd. Pullbacks occur more often in\na bull market than a bear market, which makes sense when you think about it. \nThe “Percentage meeting price target” uses half the pattern height instead\nof the full height for the measure rule computation. This approach gives bet-\nter results. In the Trading Tactics section of this chapter, I give an example of\nhow to use the rule.\nSurprises are many, but they are self-explanatory, and I discuss them in\ndepth later. \nTour\nFigure 17.1 shows an example of an Adam & Adam double top.

That qualification is important as an earlier study I did found\nthat price continues rising 65% of the time without confirming the twin-peak\npattern. Thus, always wait for confirmation unless you have valid reasons for\ntrading earlier.\nIn the example shown in Figure 17.1, volume has a U shape, the most com-\nmon.

When they look the same, you have either an AADT or an\nEve & Eve double top. The difference between an Adam top and an Eve top is\ntheir width and shape. See how the Adam tops are narrow, pointed, looking like\nan inverted V? Look at the Eve top highlighted in February.

Adam & Adam peaks A and B are not part of a double top because price\ndoes not confirm the pattern. Instead, prices rise above the higher of the two\npeaks, invalidating the double top pattern.\nFigure 17.3 shows another example of an AADT and an Eve top. The Eve\ntop is wide and composed of several short spikes—minor highs—and the group\nappears rounded. Adam tops are narrow, inverted V’s, usually composed of\none- or two-day price spikes. Prices climb into the pattern, form the tops, and\ndrop to the confirmation line, validating the AADT. In this example, volume\ntrends upward and that is unusual.

The Adam top should appear as an inverted V, narrow, and\nmany times made of a one- or two-day price spike. Eve tops appear wider and\nmore rounded as the November turn shows in Figure 17.4. Eve tops usually\nhave price spikes that are shorter and more congested.\nValley between tops. A dip should separate the two tops, making each\ntop stand out as its own minor high. Do not select patterns that are part of the\nsame congestion pattern. For this reason, the peaks marked A and B in Figure\n17.4 are not part of a double top. \nTop high prices. The price difference between the two peaks is usually\nminimal, between 0% and 6%. The key is that they should appear to be at or\nnear the same price.

The reason for this delay is that\n65% of the time, price will not drop to the confirmation line before making a\nnew high. Only after price confirms the pattern does a twin-peak pattern become\na true double top.\nFocus on Failures\nDouble tops have two types of failures. The first is one of identification. You\nmust wait for price to close below the confirmation line. Only then does the\ntwin-peak pattern become a true double top. You can try trading the pattern\nbefore price drops to the confirmation line, but if you are shorting a stock, you\nwill probably take a loss when the price soars away from you. Do the smart thing\nand wait for price to close below the low between the two peaks before trading.\nThe second type of failure is what I call a 5% failure. That means price con-\nfirms the pattern and then drops less than 5% below the breakout price before\nrebounding. It does not happen often (8% in a bull market and 11% in a bear\nmarket), but the chance is not zero. Be prepared and use a stop to limit the loss.\n280\nDouble Tops, Adam & Adam\n",

Point A is especially good because\nthe price closes near the daily low. That is important. Look for a long price spike\nwith a close near the daily low. For the first Adam peak, if you sold the day after\nthe spike, you would have made 62%. If you sold at the close the day after points\nB and A, you would have made 55% and 40%, respectively. Those are good\ngains regardless of how you slice it. \nMost amateur investors would have held onto the stock and rode it back\ndown. As it bottomed at the confirmation line, they may have sold (some did\nas the slight rise in volume suggests). Others held on, vowing to sell if price\nreached the old high. When price climbed and approached the old high, their\ntune changed. Their desire to sell melted into greed. “Why sell if the stock is\ngoing up?”\nGood point. But you have to sell sometime.

No. Every time I have done\nthat in a double top, the stock never confirmed, and I gave up profit because\nprice made new highs. Still, you can increase your profit by taking shortcuts to\nselling as the example shows (using trend lines, for instance). You can always\nbuy back in if price does not sink to the confirmation point.\nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "Adam & Eve double bottoms (AEDTs) perform about average (bull market) or\nslightly below (bear market) when compared to the average decline of other\nbearish chart pattern types. The double-digit break-even failure rate in a bull\nmarket is high, too. Thus, trade this one from the short side in a bear market for\nthe best performance. If you own the stock in a bull market and it double tops,\nyou might want to sell or not, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes it\nmay pay to weather a small decline after an AEDT, especially if the general\nmarket and others in the industry are soaring.\nAEDTs have a few surprises, and I discuss them in the Statistics section.\nTour\nAlong with the head-and-shoulders formation, double tops are perhaps the most\npopular. Many novice investors see a dual peak on the stock chart and proclaim\nit to be a double top. It probably is not. There are a number of characteristics\nthat compose a true double top and I discuss them in a moment, but, first, what\ndoes a double top look like?\nConsider Figure 18.1, a double top in ElkCorp. The first thing one notices\nare the twin peaks. They should be near the same price level and widely spaced.\nThe price trend leading to the first peak is upward and prices fall away after the\nsecond peak.\nThe intervening valley is just that: a valley that sees prices decline by 10%\nto 20%, sometimes more. The valley floor forms the confirmation level or point.\nA twin peak formation becomes a true double top once price closes below the\nconfirmation point, signaling a breakout. \nSometimes a pullback occurs such as that shown in Figure 18.1. A pullback\nallows investors another opportunity to exit their position before the decline\nresumes. For more aggressive traders, the pullback is a chance to make a short\nsale in the hope that prices will continue falling. \nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 18.1 lists identification characteristics that Adam & Eve double tops share.\nThey are only guidelines—not rules—and exceptions are many.\nUpward price trend. Figure 18.2 shows an AEDT that forms after a\nshort-term price rise beginning in November. The average rise leading to\nAEDTs is 128 days, or about 4 months long.\nTop shape. When searching for an Adam & Eve double top, remember\nthat the Adam peak should look different from Eve. Adam looks like an inverted\nV, usually with a one- or two-day price spike poking out of the top. Eve is\nrounder and wider. Adam peaks come first; Eve, second. The shape difference\nis clear in the figures accompanying this chapter.\n292\nDouble Tops, Adam & Eve\n",

I conclude that it is an AEDT,\nconfirmed when price closed below the confirmation line (the breakout in\nthe figure).\nRegardless of whether you consider the double top an AEDT or AADT,\nthe result is the same: price drops but not far. Why? An old saying goes, “Price\nhas to have something to reverse.” Here, price moves horizontally from Sep-\ntember through January, leaving little upward move to reverse. Yes, the actual\ndecline from the breakout price to the August low measures 13%, but you get\nmy point. \nViewing Figure 18.5 on the weekly scale (not shown), we find massive sup-\nport at 20, a portion of it appears as the August and October lows. Additional\nsupport appears at the triangle apex, about 23.50, right where the trading range\ncenters. Of course, apex support has no effect on the AEDT because support\nis above the breakout price. \nFocus on Failures\n297\nBreakout\nEve\nAdam\nSymmetrical\nTriangle\nUltimate\nLow\nInvacare Corp.

      "text": "The first thing to notice is that this double top occurs in a bull market. That\nsuggests a smaller decline than if it were in a bear market. The S&P 500 index\nhad just reached a new high on October 7, but was easing lower on the break-\nout day (October 16). The five stocks in the apparel industry that I follow all\nmade highs in October 1997 and by the confirmation date, were trending down-\nward. That was a good indication that the stock should be sold.\nThe Eve peak sets the yearly high, and Table 18.4 says that the worst per-\nformance comes from breakouts within a third of the yearly high. That obser-\nvation sounds a note of caution.\nThe support line set up by the ascending triangle in June suggested that\nprice would have a difficult time piercing it. Thus, expect a pullback. Table\n18.4 shows that a pullback hurts performance, but the difference in a bull mar-\nket is small.\nIs the pattern a tall one? The height as a percentage of the breakout price\nmeasures 11.4%. This is less than the median, so the pattern is short, suggest-\ning substantial underperformance.\nIs the pattern narrow? Yes. The pattern is 16 days wide (as measured\nbetween the highest high in each top). Narrow patterns marginally outperform\nin a bull market.\nWhich peak is lower? The Adam peak is lower than Eve, and Table 18.6\nsays that in a bull market, AEDTs with lower left tops underperform, but the\ndifference is not significant.\nWhat about volume? Figure 18.6 shows U-shaped volume between the\npeaks and that is good news according to Table 18.7. Patterns with U-shaped\nvolume perform significantly better that those with other shapes. Is the break-\nout volume heavy or light? I highlight the breakout volume the day after the\nbreakout, just so you can find the breakout day easily. The preceding day, the\nbreakout day, volume is light. Table 18.7 loves light breakout volume as pat-\nterns with that condition perform substantially better. Finally, which top has\nheavier volume? According to my spreadsheet, it is the right top. I used 5 days\nof volume surrounding each peak and compared the two. Table 18.7 says to\nexpect underperformance with the heavy right top volume scenario.\nThus, this analysis showed mixed technical evidence. If you owned the\nstock, you could sell on the breakout. Waiting for a pullback before selling is\ndangerous because they occur just 59% of the time, but with underlying support\nby the ascending triangle, a pullback was a good bet. \nIf you wanted to short this stock, the timing is the same. Short at the break-\nout and add to your position when price turns downward after the pullback\ncompletes, or just short when price drops again after the pullback.\nSay you short the stock at the breakout. Price pulls back then drops to\npoint A. Since that is a new minor low, place the stop a dime or so above the\ntop of the pullback, the closest minor high. Price climbs to B then drops to C.\nC is lower than A, so it is a new minor low. Lower the stop to B. Price climbs\nto D then drops to E. Move the stop to D.

Look\nat Figure 19.2 and Table 19.1 for the answer. The figure shows two Eve &\nAdam double tops with contrasting volume shapes. The February chart pattern\nhas U-shaped volume and the May pattern shows a dome shape. Patterns with\ndome-shaped volume perform better.\nUpward price trend. To create a top, price must be trending upward,\neven if the trend is short. For reference, the average price trend leading to the\ndouble top in the stocks I looked at was 84 days, or about 3 months long.\nTop shape. Look for two peaks; the left one, Eve, should be wider and\nmore rounded looking than the right one, Adam. Adam is narrow, usually an\ninverted V shape, and many times with a one- or two-day price spike. Above all\nelse, the two tops should look different from each other. \nIdentification Guidelines\n309\nConfirmation\nLine\nConfirmation\nLine\nEve\nEve\nAdam\nAdam\nCognex (Precision Instrument, NASDAQ, CGNX)\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n33\n35\n37\nMay\nJun\nJul\nFeb\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nMar\nApr\nJan 01\nFigure 19.2\nTwo twin peaks confirm as Eve & Adam double tops when price closes\nbelow the confirmation line.

The answer is unclear because the numbers are too close or have\nlow sample counts. However, many bearish patterns do best when the breakout\nis near the yearly low.\nPullbacks. EADTs in a bull market have one of the higher pullback rates.\nAlmost two out of three pull back and take between 10 and 11 days for prices\nto return to the confirmation line (the breakout).

If you see an especially dire situation developing in a stock you\nown, then protect your profits and sell early.

It\nreminds me of a measured move down chart pattern.\nDoes the pattern obey the guidelines listed in Table 19.1? The brief rise\nshown by line A satisfies the upward price trend leading to the EADT. The twin-\npeak pattern shows a rounded Eve top paired with a pointed Adam top. The\nvalley between the tops measures 9%—a bit on the short side. The two tops have\nprices that vary by just 1% and are 25 days apart. Price drops to the confirma-\ntion line without making a third peak. Volume is heavier on the left peak than\nthe right, which is unusual. Thus, the pattern meets the identification guidelines:\nit is an Eve & Adam double top.\nWhat is so special about this EADT? Two things. First, the U-shaped vol-\nume pattern is exquisite. Second, notice the quick rise leading to the pattern,\nhighlighted by line A. Price rockets upward for a week then moves sideways in\nthe pattern. Nearly as steep is the decline out of the pattern, shown by line \nB. If I were trading this double top, I would place an order to sell shares at \nthe confirmation line. That way, I would get in at a good price as the pattern\nconfirmed. \nI would expect a pullback because of the July congestion. Worst case, I\nwould put a stop at the Adam top, just in case things got out of control. For the\ndownward target, the measure rule predicts a decline to 30.10, as I discussed in\nthe “Measure rule” in Table 19.8. Since I know that a quick decline often fol-\nlows a quick rise, I would set the target lower, at the beginning of the quick\nrise, or about 27.78. Since that is below the round number 28, I would proba-\nbly target 28.07 or some oddball number. Everyone is going to try buying at 28,\nand I want to get my price before the others drive it back up. \nIn fact, you can see that price stalled at 28 for 3 days before resuming the\ntumble (point D in Figure 19.4). If, by some magic, I stayed in the trade, I would\nexpect a further decline to the down-sloping trend line.

In a bear\nmarket, the break-even failure rate is just 2% and prices decline 25% after the\nbreakout, on average. That is superb performance. Even in a bull market, the\npattern shows its stuff. After reaching the ultimate low, price soars 63%, on\naverage. Busted patterns in a bull market do even better: a 70% rise.\nThe pattern has many surprises we have heard before plus a new one.\nWhen volume is heavier on the left top than on the right, the pattern tends to\noutperform. I discuss these surprises in the Statistics section.\nTour\nFigure 20.1 shows what an Eve & Eve double top looks like. It reminds me of a\nperson with large eyebrows, the confirmation line is the nose, and the mouth\nis the U-shaped volume trend. The double top forms after an upward price\ntrend and has a rounding turn between the two highs. The rounding turn is not\na prerequisite, and I have not studied the performance of double top shapes in\nthat regard.\nThe twin peaks look similar in that both have wide bases and a gentle price\nturn at each top.

Volume on formation of the\nleft top is high but lasts only 1 day. The right top volume is dense, high, and\nremains high for about a week as the top forms.

A buy signal occurred when price closed above the down-sloping trend\nline. The high volume at B (a common bottom phenomenon) also suggested a\nbottom—panic selling. \nAdditional evidence of a major turn comes from points A and B. Point A\nmarks a major turning point for the stock; B, being a higher low, is a retest of\nthat low. Since it did not drop below A, it is a bullish signal.\nIf you missed the trend-line signal and higher low at B, then a close above\nthe double top would be another buy signal. With a 63% average rise, you have\nplenty of time to buy. If you bought at the B low, you would have made 73%.\nBuying at the EEDT high would have made a profit of 36%. The stock topped\nout at 44.13, by the way, before tumbling back to 32, near the double top high.\nNot all trades will work out as well as this one. A major bull run began\nafter the October low and the industry responded with large gains. Both helped\npropel the stock higher. A combination of bullish factors is often what sepa-\nrates a winning trade from a losing one.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help you select better per-\nforming EEDTs.

You see\nthese formations appearing in strong uptrends or downtrends (such as that\nshown in Figure 21.1), usually near the halfway point in the move. This par-\nticular flag goes against the grain in the sense that prices rise in a downtrend.\nThis is the most common behavior—a retrace in a downtrend—but it is not\nunusual for flags to appear horizontal (as short rectangles) or slope downward\n(following the trend). Since flags can also appear in an uptrend, they usually\nslope downward, but can be horizontal or slope upward too.\n336\nFlags\n",

The flag, while obeying the confines of the two down-sloping trend lines,\nhas a good volume trend. Prices should continue higher after the flag completes\nbut do not. Why? One explanation is that the formation is just too long at 26\ndays. Sometimes an excessively long formation suggests an impending failure or\na weak price move (after the breakout).

In this example, the flag is not proportional to the\nup move preceding it, suggesting the need for caution trading it.\nFigure 21.5 shows a more common failure, one of performance.

Flags show no consistent performance\ntrend as far as position in the yearly price range.

Flags performed better postbreakout when the break-\nout volume was light—below the 30-day average (the rounded-off 16% tie for\nbull markets, down breakouts actually gives the performance edge to light vol-\nume). Patterns in bear markets with downward breakouts did better with\nbreakout volume heavier than the average.\nTrading Tactics\nTable 21.8 shows trading tactics for flags. Consult Figure 21.6 as I review the\ntactics listed in Table 21.8.\nMeasure rule. The measure rule gauges the minimum price move. First,\ndetermine where the trend begins, which is usually the minor high (for down-\ntrends) or low (for uptrends) preceding the formation. Figure 21.6 shows the\ntrend beginning at point A. Subtract the low at the formation start (point B at\n42.75) from point A (47.50), giving a difference of 4.75. Subtract the difference\nfrom the high at the formation end (point C at 43) to give the target price of\n38.25. Prices reach the target 13 trading days after they move below the for-\nmation trend line.\nWhen trading flags, you must first be sure you have a valid formation.\nUse the identification guidelines outlined in Table 21.1 to ensure that you\nhave correctly identified a flag.\nUse the measure rule to gauge the amount of profit likely from the trade\nand weigh the amount of profit against the possible risk of failure. Look for\nsupport and resistance levels where price trends were repulsed in the past.\nMany times prices will pause or turn around at these junctions. These values\nbecome the risk points for a trade. You can compare the risk with the reward\nby computing the current price with the measure rule target and the first or\nsecond level of support or resistance.\nFor the stock shown in Figure 21.6, the potential reward is 4.75 (that is,\n43–38.25). The first resistance level is at 44 and there is another at 45 (assum-\ning the trade goes against you and prices rise). The risk is one or two, that \nis, 44–43 or 45–43. The ratio, at 4.75 to 1, suggests this formation is worth\nTrading Tactics\n347\nTable 21.8\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nCalculate the price difference between the start of the trend and\nthe formation.

Take a position in the stock after a breakout, once\nprices move outside the formation boundary. Once prices near the target price,\nas predicted by the measure rule, consider closing out the trade. Since the sta-\ntistics regarding the success of meeting the predicted price target are poor, be\nready to close out the trade sooner than expected.

Admittedly, the 95% price gain is less\nthan a strict interpretation of the O’Neil guidelines, but it comes close. The\nhigh, tight flag slopes downward for 38 days, 3 more days than the maximum,\nand declines by 22%, 2% over the threshold. You could argue that the num-\nbers are close enough to the O’Neil guidelines to qualify as a high, tight flag. I\naccept it as a flag.\nTable 22.1 shows the guidelines I used in selecting and evaluating high,\ntight flags.\nSubstantial rise. First, there must be a short, quick rise. By that, I mean a\nrise in which price nearly doubles in 2 months or less. It can move up more than\nthat, and the rise need not take place from a flat base (horizontal price move-\nment). In the HTFs I found, I visually looked for a doubling of the price in 2\nmonths and then let my computer determine when the trend started (see\n“Trend Start” in Glossary and Methodology for details).\nFinal consolidation. Once the stocks are selected on a price-rise basis,\nthen look for the nearest consolidation area. In my selections, I did not care\nhow long the stock consolidated nor how far the flag descended before turning\nupward. All that mattered was that the consolidation area was plainly visible to\nthe casual observer. The consolidation area should be about double the price\nof the prior 2-month low.\nReceding volume trend. The final identification guideline is not really\nfor identification as much as it is for performance. Flags with a receding vol-\nume trend outperform those without. However, I would not ignore a high,\ntight flag simply because volume is rising. Rather, I would recognize that its\nperformance may suffer.\nFocus on Failures\nInvesting in a stock showing a high, tight flag is not without risk. Figure 22.3\nshows a flag that suffers from a small rise. Since one would expect a stock to\nmove up substantially after the breakout, I consider this behavior a failure of\nthe stock to perform as expected.\nFocus on Failures\n353\nTable 22.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nSubstantial rise\nA rise lasting less than 2 months carries prices upward at\nleast 90% (shoot for a doubling of the stock price).\nFind consolidation\nLocate a consolidation area, where prices pause in the\nprevailing uptrend near where price doubles from the trend\nstart.\nReceding volume trend\nThe volume trend in the flag should be receding for best\nperformance.\n",

If the HTF has an irregular shape, use\nthe top of the pattern as the buy point and place the buy stop there.\nIf price closes below the flag pattern, sell your position immediately\nbecause price is going down. Reversals do happen, so be on guard for one.\nOnce you have a position in the stock, raise your stop to just below the prior\nminor low when price makes a new high. Keep raising the stop as prices rise.\nEventually, this method will take you out when the trend changes or during a\nsevere retrace.\nSample Trade\nWhen John spotted the high, tight flag shown in Figure 22.4, he wasted no\ntime in taking a position, buying when price pierced the upper trend line at\npoint A. He placed a stop 0.13 below the formation low at 5.63.

The remain-\ning gap, the ex-dividend gap, is not considered because it rarely happens and has\nno investment significance. The ex-dividend gap usually occurs in utility stocks\nor stocks with high-paying dividends. On the day of dividend distribution, the\nprice sometimes moves downward leaving a gap in the price chart. Even though\nthe price of the stock after distribution reduces by the dividend amount, the\nday’s trading range often fills the gap so no actual gap appears on the chart.\nI define closing the gap to be when prices return and span the gap completely.\nThe area gap closes quickest, with nearly 90% of those gaps closing within a week.\nListed in the Results Snapshot table is the average time it takes price to\nclose the gap. Sometimes gaps close quickly (such as exhaustion gaps) because\nthey are found near the ends of trends where price reverses and fills the gap.\nOther gaps take much longer since they mark the start of a strong trend (break-\naway gap). The continuation gap is a combination of the two because it com-\nmonly appears in the middle of trends.\nGaps had a few surprises. I found that larger gaps appear in bear markets\nfor some reason. Performance improves for gaps in bull markets when they\nappear near the yearly high. Finally, large gaps perform better than small ones.\nTour\nA gap appears in an uptrend price series when yesterday’s daily high is below\ntoday’s low price. A downtrend gap is similar, being created when yesterday’s\nlow is above today’s high. In both cases, some type of exuberance is driving the\nstock to create a gap. It sometimes is nothing more than the stock being worth\nless simply because of a dividend distribution. At other times, the repercussions\nare more severe. An earnings surprise, either positive or negative, often causes\na gap and the stock to rise by 10% or 15% or to decline by 30% or more,\ndepending on the severity of the news.\nFigure 23.1 shows a plethora of different gap types. Area gaps occur in\ncongestion zones, usually when prices are moving sideways. Price gaps up or\ndown and the gaps close quickly. Of all the gap types, area gaps are common,\nappearing all over the place. Breakaway gaps appear at the start of trends. They,\ntoo, are quite numerous and accompany high volume. Usually there is some\nfundamental event driving the stock, creating a breakaway gap. Continuation\nTour\n363\n",

To successfully trade gaps you have to\nbe quick, making sure to use stops, and you have to be ready to close out a trade\nat a moment’s notice. Still, they can be profitable. Consider what Gina did with\nthe situation shown in Figure 23.3.\nAs a seasoned investor, Gina knew all about gaps and practiced trading\nthem on paper until she was successful most of the time. The practice honed\nher skills and pulling the trigger seemed rote. With a focus on limiting her\nlosses, she was growing confident that her trading style was one that would\nallow her to succeed in the markets, so she took the leap and decided to trade\nher system for real.\nShe followed the stock for a long time and was both familiar and com-\nfortable with the fundamentals of the company. When she noticed the break-\naway gap occur on May 10, she quickly checked the identification guidelines.\nVolume was above average (although it may not be clear from the chart) and a\nnew upward price trend seemed to be forming. She called her broker and\nbought 1,000 shares receiving a fill at 58 that day.\nShe placed a stop-loss order at 57, 0.13 below the lower gap rim just to\nbe safe. If this turned out to be an area gap, she would probably be stopped out\nfor a small loss. During her paper trading days, she discovered that most gaps\nprovide near-term support or resistance, so she was confident that her stop\nwould hold.\nTrading Tactics and Sample Trade\n371\nTable 23.6\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nArea gaps\nThese gaps are too short-lived to be traded profitably, consistently.\nBreakaway gaps\nIf high volume is present at the start of a trend, then trade with\nthe trend. Verify gap type by reviewing the identification\nguidelines before trading.\nContinuation gaps\nContinuation gaps usually mark the halfway point so you can\ngauge the eventual price move. Measure from the trend start to\nthe gap center and project the difference from the gap center to\nthe predicted high or low.\nExhaustion gaps\nIf an abnormally wide gap occurs or a gap occurs at the end of a\ntrend, then close out your position when the trend reverses. After\na trend reversal, consider trading the new trend (shorting the\nstock if the prior trend was up). Violent reversals often follow\nexhaustion gaps. Close out the trade the day after new highs (for\nuptrends) or new lows (downtrends) fail to occur.\nStop loss\nThe lower rim (for uptrends) or the higher rim (for downtrends) of\na gap is a good place to put a stop (0.15 or so away from the rim).\nGaps provide near-term support or resistance, so this strategy\nworks well with those gaps that do not close quickly.\n",

Those in a bull market rise\nby 38% in a bull market and 30% in a bear market.\nHSBs have a few surprises in store for traders, including breakout day\ngaps that help power the stock upward. Tall and narrow patterns perform bet-\nter than do their short and wide counterparts. HSBs with falling volume trends\nor U-shaped volume perform better.\nTour\nWhat does the formation look like? Figure 24.1 shows a good example of a\nhead-and-shoulders bottom. The stock peaks during February, where the fig-\nure begins. From that point, the stock moves downward and makes a lower low\nin late March before moving up. The turn marks the left shoulder. The stock\ndeclines again and reaches a new low during late April, forming the head.

By mid-August\n1995(not shown), the stock is trading just below 60.\nAccording to new statistics, the head-and-shoulders bottom shown in\nFigure 24.1 has a typical volume pattern. Volume is usually highest on the\nhead, then the left shoulder, and even lower on the right shoulder. The rise\nfrom the head to the right shoulder accompanies a rise in volume as does the\nactual breakout.\nIn contrast, the formation shows little increase in volume during the rise\nfrom the head to the right shoulder. Volume on the breakout is unexciting and\nthat helps explain why the stock stalls. Upward momentum fails to carry price\nmuch higher; the stock rounds over and heads back down.\nFigure 24.2 shows a head-and-shoulders formation on a weekly time\nscale. I chose this chart to show you the typical trend of head-and-shoulders\nbottom reversals. They usually form after an extended downtrend in prices. As\na reversal, once they complete, prices rise.\nWhy do HSBs form? The chart pattern represents a struggle to find the\nbottom, the lowest price that represents the best value. As the stock descends\nduring February 1994, investors nibble at the stock in increasing numbers.\nVolume climbs even as the stock descends until it spikes upward for 1 week\nduring formation of the left shoulder. Buying demand puts a crimp on the\ndownward slide and prices move up but only for a week. The following week,\nprices move lower.

The left shoulder has very\nhigh volume, the head exhibits somewhat less volume, and the right shoulder\nrecords the lowest volume up to that point. Only after prices start moving up\nfrom the right shoulder does volume spike upward.\nBreakout volume, depending on where you determine the breakout\noccurs, is unconvincing. In late August, prices move decidedly above the neck-\nline and stage a definitive breakout. Even so, it is not until 2 weeks later that\nvolume advances noticeably.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 24.1 encapsulates the identification guidelines for HSBs. Consider Figure\n24.3, a head-and-shoulders bottom. The formation does not appear at the end of\na long-term downtrend but at a short-term one (up to 3 months). The uptrend\nbegins the prior June with another head-and-shoulders bottom. The formation\nreverses the slight short-term downtrend but continues the long-term uptrend.\nShape. Overall, the formation sports the three telltale troughs: left shoul-\nder, head, and right shoulder. The left shoulder is at about the same price level\nas the right one and appears to be about the same width. Such symmetry is\ncommon in head-and-shoulders formations (tops, bottoms, and the complex\nvariety). If the left shoulder is sharp or pointed, the right shoulder will be too.\nThe head is below both shoulders by a reasonable amount. By this char-\nacteristic I mean the formation is not a triple bottom—three troughs at about\nthe same price level.\nIdentification Guidelines\n377\nTable 24.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nShape\nA three-trough formation with the center trough below the other\ntwo. It looks like a head-and-shoulders bust flipped upside down.\nThe three troughs and two minor rises should appear well defined.\nSymmetry\nThe left and right shoulders should be opposite one another about\nthe head, somewhat equidistant in both time and price. There are\nwide variations, but the formation is noticeably symmetrical about\nthe head.\nVolume\nUsually highest on the left shoulder or head and diminished on the\nright shoulder.\nNeckline\nA line that connects the rise between the two shoulders. A neckline\npierce signals an upward breakout. For up-sloping necklines, use\nthe highest high in the pattern as the breakout price.\nUpward breakout\nThe breakout is upward, usually on high volume that powers\nprices upward. A low volume breakout is not an indicator of an\nimpending failure.\n",

      "text": "In Figure 24.3, the left shoulder suddenly declines for 3 days, then\nreverses and climbs to a minor high. Similarly, the rise between the head and\nright shoulder climbs almost to the height of the rise between the left shoulder\nand head then descends to the right shoulder. All five features, the three\ntroughs and two minor rises, appear well defined and distinct. The features are\nimportant as you scan your charts looking for head-and-shoulders bottoms.\nSymmetry. Symmetry is another important key to selecting a valid head-\nand-shoulders bottom. The right side of the formation usually mimics the left\nside. The right shoulder declines to about the price level of the left shoulder\nand the distances of both from the head are similar. Of course, there are many\nvariations, but symmetry should make a head-and-shoulders bottom stand out\nfrom a sequence of any three depressions.\nVolume. Volume represents another clue to the validity of a bottom.\nThe left shoulder or head has the highest volume, with diminished volume on\nthe right shoulder.\nBreakout volume is usually high as it pushes prices above the neckline.\nHowever, in a quarter of the formations in a bull market, breakout volume is\nwell below the 30-day average. As a rule, volume will rise on the day of the\nbreakout, but it need not.\nNeckline. The neckline is an imaginary line connecting the two rises\nbetween the shoulders and the head. It can slope downward or upward. In\nwell-formed formations, the slope of the line is not very steep, but a steep\nneckline should not be a disqualifier of a head-and-shoulders bottom (see Fig-\nure 24.1—it has a rather steep neckline).\n378\nHeads-and-Shoulders Bottoms\nAug\nFeb 95\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJul\nJun\n3 Com Corp.

Use\nthe formation high as the breakout point instead of an up-sloping neckline\nbecause you will get a by signal sooner. You may never get a signal in an HSB\nwith a steep up-sloping neckline.\nFocus on Failures\nLike most formations, there are two types of failures. The first type, shown in\nFigure 24.4, is a failure of the head-and-shoulders bottom to pierce the neckline\nand move higher. As you would expect, the formation appears after a downtrend\nin prices. The highest price peak is partly visible in the upper left corner of Fig-\nure 24.4. From the high of 38.75, prices fall to the low at the head, 21.25, a\ndecline of 45%. When the bottom forms, it should signal a trend reversal.\nAn interesting thing about the formation in Figure 24.4 is that the left shoul-\nder is almost the same shape as the right. Only a dollar separates the two shoul-\nder lows and the head is well below both shoulder troughs. The right shoulder is\nsomewhat farther away from the head than the left. This characteristic is typical.\nVolume is suspiciously low throughout the formation. The left shoulder\nand head register about the same level of volume. The right shoulder volume,\nhowever, is higher than the other two. Of course, an irregular volume pattern\nis no reason to discard a formation—but it serves as a warning.\nAfter the right shoulder forms and price begins rising, volume tapers off\nrapidly, and the attempt to pierce the neckline fails. The rally attempt does not\neven come close to the neckline.\nFocus on Failures\n379\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nMar 94\nApr\nMay\nJul\nJun\nASA Holdings (Air Transport, NASDAQ, ASAI)\nHead\nLeft\nShoulder\nRight\nShoulder\n– 38\n– 36\n– 34\n– 32\n– 30\n– 28\n– 26\n– 24\n– 22\n– 20\n– 18\n– 16\n– 14\n– 12\n– 10\n–   8\nFigure 24.4\nFailure of a head-and-shoulders bottom to stage an upside breakout.\n",

There is some suspicious activity, principally the abnormal\nvolume pattern, but nothing to deter an investor.\nFigure 24.5 shows a slightly different type of failure. This is what I call a 5%\nfailure. The two shoulders and head appear well formed and distinct. The left\nshoulder looks different from the right, but the twin rises between the shoulders\nare similar. The price level of the two shoulders is not suspiciously out of line.\nVolume is unusual. The only heavy volume appears near the head as\nprices rise away from it toward the right shoulder.

The\nstock moves sideways for 2 weeks before starting back down.\nAlthough this formation does have an upward breakout, price fails to rise\nby more than 5% above the neckline.

Add the difference to the point where prices pierce\nthe neckline. The result is the target price to which prices will\nrise, at a minimum. For up-sloping necklines, substitute the\nrise between the head and right shoulder (that is, the highest\nprice in the rise) for the neckline breakout price.\nWait for confirmation\nIf you can determine that a head-and-shoulders formation is\ncompleting, consider buying the stock. This formation rarely\ndisappoints and the rise is worth betting on. However, you\nmust be sure that a head-and-shoulders bottom is present.\nOtherwise, wait for price to close above the neckline or\nhighest high.\nStop loss\nPlace a stop-loss order below the lower of the two shoulders.\nOften, prices drop to the shoulder lows before meeting\nsupport.

After all, if\nyou can locate a normal head-and-shoulders bottom, then there is a decent\nchance that you are also looking at a complex one. If you look to the left and\nright of the two shoulders, you might see additional shoulders. Multiple shoul-\nders are one indication of a complex formation. But before I delve too far into\npattern recognition, let me briefly review the important snapshot statistics.\nThe complex head-and-shoulders bottom (CHSB) is a strong performer\nwith a low break-even failure rate and a very good average gain after the break-\nout. The volume trend slopes downward, and about two-thirds throw back to the\nbreakout price. However, when a throwback occurs, performance suffers. Thus,\nyou should look for nearby overhead resistance and avoid patterns showing it.\nTo improve postbreakout performance, look for patterns with a rising\nvolume trend, random volume shape, or heavy breakout volume, or having a\ndown-sloping neckline. CHSBs with those qualities tend to perform better\nthan do CHSBs without those traits.\nTour\nThere are two types of complex head-and-shoulders bottoms: those with mul-\ntiple shoulders and those with multiple heads.

The two outer-\nmost shoulders are near the same price level too.\nLooking at all the shoulders and the head together, the chart is a good\nexample of a complex head-and-shoulders bottom. However, the volume pat-\ntern is unusual as it is heavier on the right than on the left. Most of the time,\nthe left shoulders show higher volume than the right pair, but the head has the\nhighest volume about half the time.\nIf you ignore the various labels, you can see a rounding bottom.

The stock rises but throws back\nagain before finally breaking away and heading higher. By late March the stock\nreaches a high of 16.63, well above the head low of 9.19.\nVolume on the left side of the formation is heavier than on the right. In\nthis regard, the formation is more typical than that shown in Figure 25.1.\nIdentification Guidelines\nAre there certain characteristics that make head-and-shoulders bottoms easy to\nidentify? Yes, and they are outlined in Table 25.1.\nShape. As discussed before, there are two general types of complex head-\nand-shoulder bottoms: those with multiple shoulders and those with multiple\nheads (rarely do you have both). Figure 25.3 shows a complex bottom with\nmultiple shoulders. The head is distinctly below the shoulders, far enough\nbelow to distinguish the chart pattern from a triple bottom.\nSymmetry. In this case, there is a normal head-and-shoulders bottom\nflanked by an additional pair of shoulders. The overall formation appears sym-\nmetrical. The two left shoulders match the two on the right in distance. Fig-\nure 25.3 shows a far right shoulder that is higher than its corresponding left\none. However, the basic symmetrical pattern is typical for nearly all complex\nhead-and-shoulders bottoms.\nVolume. Figure 25.3 also shows the usual volume pattern: The two left\nshoulders show higher volume than the two right ones. Overall, the volume\ntrend is a receding one.\nNear horizontal neckline. The neckline connects the highest peak on\nthe left with the highest peak on the right. Most of the time the line is nearly\nhorizontal. Although this is subjective, a scan of all the formations indicates\nthat 74% obey this guideline. Many of the formations shown in this chapter\nhave near horizontal necklines.\nUpward breakout. For those with up-sloping necklines, use the highest\nhigh in the formation as the breakout price. Using a steep up-sloping neck-\nline to gauge the breakout point is risky. Prices may never close above the \nneckline.\nOnce price closes above the neckline, a breakout occurs. Quite often,\nprices throw back to the neckline and perhaps move lower before ultimately\ncontinuing higher. Figure 25.2 shows an example of this behavior during late\nDecember when prices plunged from a high of 11.50 to 9.44, a decline of\nalmost 20% in just 2 days! When the decline ended, prices recovered quickly.\nThe formation shown in Figure 25.3 is unusual because it acts as a con-\nsolidation of the uptrend. Prices from November through January climb\nsteadily and then resume moving up after the breakout. The formation is a\nconsolidation region, where prices move horizontally for a spell.\nIdentification Guidelines\n393\n",

Prices falling below the\nhead signal a formation failure, and it is best to cut your losses instead of pray-\ning that they will turn around. They will not.\nWatch for throwback.

Depending on when you bought the stock, you could\nhave seen a near 10% price improvement if you had waited a few days.\nSample Trade\nWhen the weather is nice, I like to take my bicycle out for a spin and give the\nautomobile drivers something to aim for. On one of my bike trips I met\nMelody. After I told her what I did for a living, she confessed that she was a\nnightclub dancer and made oodles in tips. I was unsure whether I bought her\nstory, but she looked pretty enough (wearing a bike helmet and sun glasses,\nwho can tell?).\nAnyway, she told me about a trade she had made in the stock pictured in\nFigure 25.5. The stock intrigued her because a trend line drawn from the high-\nest high in early October to just after the head marked a turning point. That is\nwhere prices moved up enough to pierce the trend line.\nMelody knew that prices usually retest the low before beginning an\nextended move upward, so she followed the stock and watched it loop around\nand dip to 14. Then she glanced sideways and noticed the other dip at 14.38.\nThat is when she uncovered the (inner) head-and-shoulders bottom.\nA neckline connecting the rises between the two shoulders was impossibly\nsteep; there was no way she could apply the traditional measure rule to deter-\nmine a target price (because price had not closed above the neckline), so she\ndecided to buy into the stock when prices closed above the right shoulder high.\nThis event occurred in late May and she received a fill at 17.50. Taking a\ncloser look at the graph, she saw two more shoulders, one during early Febru-\nary and the mirror image in mid-May, both at 16. Her simple head-and-shoul-\nders bottom changed into the complex variety.\nThe realization did not affect her investment plans at all, but it made the\nsituation more interesting. She wondered if another pair of shoulders would\nappear. Her suspicions were fulfilled during late July when another shoulder\ndeveloped. This one at 15.75 mirrored the shoulder in mid-December 1993.\nSoon, prices began moving up. They climbed above the break-even point in\nmid-August and staged an upward breakout. Now she was able to apply the\nmeasure rule for the complex bottom and found the target was 22.13.\nSample Trade\n403\n",

Since the target serves as a mini-\nmum price move, prices often continue moving down, as in Figure 26.5.\nThe measure rule, as just described, is the conventional way to compute\na target price. However, it does have a flaw. Consider Figure 26.6. Prices dur-\ning the right trough recession decline to 27.75, well below the higher trough\nat 31.25. A neckline joining the two is too steep. Prices never plunge through\nthe neckline, and it is impossible to compute a target price using the conven-\ntional method. Instead, compute the formation height by taking the difference\nbetween the highest high in the head and the lowest low in the highest trough\n(point A on the chart). After finding the formation height, subtract the value\nfrom point A to get the target price. In this example, the highest high is at\n33.63 and the lowest low at the highest trough is 31.25, giving a height of 2.38.\nSubtract the result from 31.25 to get a target of 28.87. Figure 26.6 shows this\nvalue, and prices reach the target during mid-April.\nThe alternative method has two advantages.

Kelly followed the stock closely and when the head appeared,\nshe made a note on her program that it might turn into a head-and-shoulders\ntop. “It just had that certain feel.” She was correct.\nThe right shoulder plunge took prices lower than she expected but\nquickly recovered to near the left shoulder high. She drew a neckline below the\ntwo valleys and thought the line was too steep to serve as an anchor for the\nmeasure rule, so she used the alternate measure rule and computed a target\nprice of just 28.88. This did not seem right either, so she used the right shoul-\nder low to compute another target. This one turned out to be 21.88, or the\nheight from the head to the right shoulder valley projected downward from the\nvalley low. That target would take prices back to the July 1993 level and it\nseemed reasonable to her.\nStill, something bothered her about the stock and she decided not to\ntrade it.

Avoid\npatterns that are both short and wide—Table 26.6.\n• Select patterns with a rising volume trend and heavy breakout vol-\nume—Table 26.7.\n• Patterns with U-shaped volume do best—Table 26.7.\n• Pick patterns with volume highest during formation of the head—\nTable 26.7.\n• Choose patterns with horizontal or up-sloping necklines—Table 26.8.\n• Patterns with higher left shoulder peaks perform best—Table 26.8.\n420\nHeads-and-Shoulders Tops\n",

Both forma-\ntions have a volume trend that generally slopes downward between the shoulders.\nThe left shoulders often have higher volume than the corresponding right ones.\nThe complex pattern has a few surprises, beginning with pullbacks. When\nthey occur, performance suffers. This behavior is typical for many chart patterns,\nbut I find it interesting nonetheless. Other surprises include tall patterns per-\nforming better than short ones and CHSTs with a rising volume trend and heavy\nbreakout volume showing improved performance. I discuss these later.\nTour\nThere are two basic varieties of complex head-and-shoulder tops, as illustrated in\nFigures 27.1 and 27.2. In Figure 27.1, the formation appears after an extended\nbull run that begins in November 1992 and then melts back by mid-October,\nforming a base for the head and shoulders. The stock rebounds, creating the\nleft shoulder.

Once prices slip from the head, they find\ntraction at the first shoulder trough and rebound. The right shoulder takes\nshape. After declining through the neckline, formed by a line joining the two\nshoulder troughs, prices quickly pull back and move higher.

      "text": "The first shoulder forms as prices touch 27.88, then retreat to a low of 22.\nThe decline undoubtedly upset our investor pal. He probably told himself that\nhe would sell the stock once it returned to its old high.\nIn early January, prices zoom upward and make a smaller peak at 27.50.\nSince the rise is so steep, our intrepid investor thinks, why sell the stock when it\nis going to go higher? He is right. Price retraces a bit then moves higher and\nforms the head at a price of 28.63. Once the head completes, things start to go\nwrong for our buddy. He is swayed by glowing predictions on the Internet of\nthe stock moving up to 35 or 40 within a year.\nAt the top, prices round over and start down. They stop midway between\nthe troughs of the two left shoulders before making one final attempt at a new\nhigh. Up to this point, there are several opportunities to sell the stock at a good\nprice. Did our novice investor take them? Probably not. Always optimistic that\nprices will ultimately break out and reach higher ground, he does not see the\nbudding complex head-and-shoulders formation for what it is: a warning.\nWhen prices drop below the neckline, our novice investor has just 2 days\nbefore things really get going. On the third day the stock closes at 23, near the\nlow for the day. Prices quickly unravel and ultimately reach a low of 15, just a\nfew dollars above the purchase price. That is when our investor throws in the\ntowel and sells the stock. Of course, this is near the low and the stock ulti-\nmately climbs to 30 a year later.\nIdentification Guidelines\nHow can our novice investor recognize the bearish reversal? Table 27.1 out-\nlines some identification tips of a complex head-and-shoulders top.\nShape. Consider Figure 27.3, another example of a multiple shoulder chart\npattern. After a decline from a head-and-shoulders formation just off the left side\nof the chart (only the right shoulder appears in the figure), prices decline until\nreaching bottom at the start of July. Then they rise up, haltingly, and form a new\nhead-and-shoulders formation: a complex top. If you ignore the labels for a\nmoment, the inner price action looks like a rounding top. This smooth price\nrollover is common for complex head-and-shoulder formations. Of course, the\nflat head shape for a multiple shoulder pattern (Figure 27.2) is also typical.\nSymmetry. You can divide Figure 27.3 into a pure head-and-shoulders\nformation by ignoring the outer shoulders. For single-head formations, this is\nthe easiest way to correctly identify a complex head-and-shoulders top. First\nlocate a regular head-and-shoulders pattern and then expand your view to\ninclude additional shoulders. In this example, the head rises above the sur-\nrounding shoulders. The two shoulders are usually equidistant, or nearly so,\nfrom the head. The price level of the left and right shoulders is very nearly the\nsame. Thus, the symmetry of a complex head-and-shoulders top is more pro-\nnounced than that of a regular head-and-shoulders formation.\n424\nHeads-and-Shoulders Tops, Complex\n",

      "text": "In a regular head-and-shoulders formation, one shoulder may be higher\nin price than the other or one shoulder will be much further away from the\nhead—a rather extended shoulder. That is usually not the case with the com-\nplex variety. Symmetry is paramount and a key identification element.\nMoving to the outer shoulders, they also are equidistant from the head and\nare very nearly at the same price level as well. Continuing the symmetry exam-\nple, the two peaks labeled left shoulder 1 and right shoulder 1 appear to be\nshoulders of the same formation, although further away than the inner grouping.\nIf you consider the inner quad of shoulders as part of the head, then what\nremains is a large, regular head-and-shoulders formation. This formation is\ndenoted by left shoulder 1, right shoulder 1, and the large, rounded head (com-\nposed of five minor highs). Even the outer neckline supports this example as\nprices touch the line several times before dropping through it in a 1-day\ndecline of about four points.\nVolume. If you could zoom in on the volume pattern, you would see it is\nmarginally heavier on the left side of the formation than on the right, at least\nfor the formation bounded by the inner (higher) neckline. High volume on the\nleft side of the formation as compared to the right is typical for complex head-\nand-shoulders formations and occurs about two-thirds of the time.\nNeckline and breakout. The neckline joins the lows of the lowest\ntrough and is interpreted the same way as a normal head-and-shoulders top.\nOnce price pierces the neckline, a downward breakout occurs and prices move\nlower. Volume typically rises on a breakout and can remain high for several\ndays, depending on the severity of the decline.\nFocus on Failures\nComplex head-and-shoulders patterns suffer two types of failures. Both are\nrare. Figure 27.4 shows the first type. I define a downward breakout as a close\nbelow the neckline, or in the case of steep necklines, a close below the lowest\nshoulder trough. Figure 27.4 shows price declining below the neckline only\nonce on May 8 but closing above it. From that point, prices rise and move\nabove the highest head and an upward breakout occurs.\nThe formation itself is well formed. It has two heads at about the same\nlevel and two shoulders also near the same price level. Symmetry throughout\nthe formation looks good, too, as the shoulders are equidistant from the head.\nVolume appears heavier on the left shoulder than on the right, as you would\nexpect. Only during the decline from the right head to the right shoulder does\nvolume rise. In short, there is no real indication that price will fail to continue\nmoving down, but it does.\nFigure 27.5 shows a slightly different situation.

      "text": "Measure rule. The measure rule predicts the minimum expected\ndecline. Look at Figure 27.6 as an example of the measure rule outlined in\nTable 27.9. Compute the formation height by subtracting the difference\nbetween the highest high (31.63) from the value of the neckline directly below\nthe highest high (27). Subtract the result (4.63) from the breakout price\n(25.75), which is where declining prices pierce the neckline. Prices drop below\nthe target price of 21.12 in early March.\nThis is the conventional measuring rule and it is successful between 45%\nand 53% of the time. That is below the 80% success rate I like to see for mea-\nsure rules. The conventional method also has a flaw when the neckline slopes\nsteeply. Under such circumstances, prices may never pierce the neckline and\nyet the stock is tumbling. Fortunately, the neckline rarely slopes steeply in\ncomplex formations. However, if you do run across a formation with a plung-\ning neckline, use the lowest of the shoulder troughs as the breakout price.\nCompute the formation height in the normal manner, but subtract the height\nfrom the trough value to get a target price.\nA slightly more conservative measure rule computes the formation height\nfrom the highest high to the higher of the neckline troughs. Then subtract the\nresult from the higher of the neckline troughs and the result is the target price.\nThis method works between 51% (bear markets) and 62% (bull markets) of \nthe time.\n434\nHeads-and-Shoulders Tops, Complex\nStandard Microsystems Corp.

      "text": "Using the chart pattern shown in Figure 27.6 as an example, the highest\nhigh is at 31.63 and the higher of the two neckline troughs is at point A, 27.50\n(using the daily low price). This gives a formation height of 4.13 (31.63 –\n27.50) and a target price of 23.38 (or 27.50 – 4.12). Prices reach the target dur-\ning the large 1-day decline on March 2.\nIf the head-and-shoulders formation does not occur after an extended\nupward trend—the situation shown in Figure 27.1—then prices will probably\ndrop back to the low where the formation began. In Figure 27.1, the low just\nbefore prices start rising to the formation is about 28. That is the level to\nwhich prices return after the breakout.\nAt other times, the formation will suddenly shoot up from a base, then\njust as quickly return to the base. Figures 27.2 and 27.5 show examples of this\nsituation.\nWait for confirmation. Since a simple head-and-shoulders pattern\nmakes up a CHST, trade the inner head-and-shoulders. That strategy may\nallow you to place a trade sooner than waiting for price to close below the\nneckline or shoulder low. For conservative investors, wait for the CHST to\nconfirm (when price closes below the neckline or shoulder low). If you own the\nstock, sell it after confirmation because price is going down. Count on it!\nShort stop. For short positions, look for areas of strength—resistance\nlevels—and place a stop-loss order just above that level. Common resistance\nlevels are the shoulder troughs, shoulder tops, and head top. Should the price\nrise above the highest high in the CHST, cover the short, as price is likely to\ncontinue climbing.\nWatch for pullback. Sometimes price breaks out downward then\nregroups and rises above the neckline before plunging down again (see Figure\n27.1 and 27.3). These extended pullbacks and regular pullbacks are good places\nto initiate a short sale or add to a short position.\nSample Trade\nHenry runs a small hedge fund. He considered buying into the stock shown in\nFigure 27.6, but needed more bullish evidence. In August 1994, indicators he\nuses on a daily basis confirmed a buy signal, so he bought shares for his fund at\nan average price of about 17.25.\nIn January 1995, Henry suspected the end was near, so he began taking a\ncloser look at the fundamentals. He was so engrossed with his research on the\ncompany that he failed to notice a pattern forming. Over drinks with his fund\nmanager friends, he shared with them what he had dug up about the company.\nThe news was not good.\n“So that’s why it’s making a broadening top!” one remarked. Henry fur-\nrowed his brow and pictured the price action in his mind and there it was, a\nbroadening top, just like his friend had said.\nSample Trade\n435\n",

      "text": "The next day Henry pulled up the chart and looked at it more closely. He\nsaw higher highs and lower lows (see the zoom out in Figure 27.6), character-\nistic of a broadening pattern. Coupled with his fundamental research on the\ncompany, he knew it was nearing time to sell, but not yet. He wanted to sell at\nthe top, when prices tagged the top trend line.\nIn early February, when prices attempted to reach the previous high, they\nfell short, dipped down for a few days, and tried again (the two right shoulders).\nThe second rise was even shorter than the prior one, signaling weakness, so\nHenry started selling immediately.\nThe failure to sail across the formation and touch the top of the broad-\nening formation meant it was a partial rise. A partial rise in a broadening top\nusually means one thing: A downward breakout will follow.\nBy the time the stock pulled back up to the base of the two right shoul-\nders (point B), Henry had sold his holdings. As he was getting ready to leave\nhis office for home, something on his computer screen caught his eye. The\nbroadening pattern had changed into a complex head-and-shoulders top.\nThere were the two left shoulders balancing the two right ones with a head\nperched in the center.\nHenry discussed the new situation with his mentor and his fund manager\nbuddies, then decided to short the stock. By the time prices reached the long-\nterm up trend line, he had a tidy sum sold short.\nTwo days later, prices tumbled. They dropped 20% or $5 a share in 1 day\nand continued down. In less than a week, they were at 16 before finding some\nsupport, a plummet of 36%.\nHenry had studied the behavior of dead-cat bounces, and he pulled out\nhis notes and brushed up. He knew the stock would bounce upward, usually\nwithin a week, then trend lower.\nTrue to form, prices moved up a bit (to 18.13), but it was not the smooth,\nrounded bounce he expected. In the coming days, prices moved lower, so\nHenry quit complaining, but he watched the situation closely.\nThe stock bottomed out at about 16 and trended horizontally. To him, it\nlooked as if the stock were building a base and preparing for an upward move,\nso he covered half his short position. In late April, when prices jumped up to\n18.50, he immediately covered the remainder of his position.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select CHSTs that per-\nform better after the breakout.

Table 28.1 shows identification\ncharacteristics.\nWeekly chart, downward spikes. Horns are visible on weekly charts.\nAlthough they appear on daily charts, weekly charts make selection easier. For\nthe formation on the left in Figure 28.2, the chart shows two long, downward\nprice spikes separated by a week. The low of the center week stays well above\neither of the spike lows, emphasizing the inverted horn shape of the formation.\nLooking back over the months, you can see that there are no downward\nspikes that come near the length of the horn spikes (as measured from the low-\nest low to the lower of the two adjacent weeks). The twin horns mark an\nunusual event, one that an investor should pay attention to.\nClear visibility. For the left formation in Figure 28.2, the horn appears\nafter a downward price trend, allowing clear visibility to the left of the forma-\ntion, as no downward trends or price outliers obscure the view. This visibility\nis important in that the formation should stand alone and not be part of a con-\ngestion region. It should mark the turning point of a downward price trend.\nThe formation shown on the right of the chart in Figure 28.2 is what a\nhorn bottom looks like in an uptrend. There is a small price retrace, of 3 weeks’\nduration, just as the horn bottoms out. These few weeks separate the formation\nfrom the surrounding price action and allow easy recognition.\nThe two spikes share the same low price, 14.50, and have good price\noverlap (as the right spike almost completely overlaps the left one).

The twin bottom pattern confirms as a valid horn bottom\nwhen price closes above the highest high in the 3-week pattern.

      "text": "Threat assessment. After you have correctly identified the horn, look at\nthe surrounding price pattern. Is the stock trending higher and has it been\nmoving higher for months now? If so, then the horn may signal an approach-\ning top. Sometimes the horn calls the turn exactly while at other times it is off\nby a few months (usually it precedes the turn but sometimes it lags).\nIf the horn appears on a downtrend, that is fine. The formation is simply\nimplying that the trend will continue moving down. However, should the horn\nappear after an extended downtrend, then the possibility of further declines\nmay be in jeopardy. This behavior is especially true if the horn appears after a\nlong downtrend when prices are beginning to move up again (they are retrac-\ning some of their losses). Often the retrace signals a trend change. You will be\nbuying into a situation in which you believe prices will fall and retest the low,\nbut prices will dip slightly and then head higher.\nBe cautious when selling short after a long downtrend, and be especially\ncautious if the downtrend has ended and the horn seems to mark the end of an\nupward retrace. Do not expect prices to fall far. They do occasionally but the\nmajority of the decline has already passed.\nLow volume. Spikes with volume below the 1-month average show\nlower failure rates while improving the average decline in a bull market. That\nis worth considering before you place a trade.\nTrend change. Even if a horn top fails and prices drop by less than 5%,\nthere is a chance that the horn is a premature signal of a bearish trend change.\nTherefore, whenever you see a horn top, be aware that the end of an uptrend\nmay be just a few months away.\nSample Trade\nYou might be saying, “Those bromides are all fine and good, but how do I\nreally trade it?” Consider the situation in Figure 29.4 faced by Sandy. She\nwatched the complex head-and-shoulders formation take shape in a stock she\nowned. Volume on the far left shoulder was higher than during the head, as\nexpected, and volume on the far right shoulder was further diminished. All in\nall, it was setting up to be a dire situation. When she spotted the horn top\nforming on the right shoulder, she knew the end was near.\nTwo weeks after the right horn spike appeared, she sold her holdings in\nthe stock for a tidy profit, but she was not finished. The following week, she\nshorted the stock at 34.25. Her calculations using the measure rule for the\nhead-and-shoulder formation indicated a decline to 16. This was higher than\nthe 12 predicted by the measure rule because she used her sell point instead of\nthe breakout point (which was not reached yet so she had no idea what it was).\nWith the stock selling at 34, a drop to 16 seemed too optimistic. Still, she\nwatched with glee as the stock plummeted. In rapid order it fell to about 25\nbefore meeting support. Sandy scanned the weekly chart looking for support\nSample Trade\n461\n",

The gaps must overlap prices or be quite close to one another. In this\nstudy, all islands have price gaps within 0.13 of one another and are at least\n0.25 or larger. In addition, I did not consider one-day reversals (islands com-\nposed of 1 day) as part of this study.

Consider Figure 30.2, which shows several island reversals.\nThe first two islands happen as part of a retrace in a downtrend. The small\nisland tops last for about a week before prices resume their downward plunge.\nThe island bottom forms after an extensive decline that sees prices drop\nfrom a high of 36.50 to 12 in less than 5 months. The exhaustion gap occurs on\nvery high volume and prices that day have a very large 3.50 trading range. The\ngap remains open until prices gap upward in late January. Looking at the bot-\ntom formation overall, it looks like a complex head-and-shoulders bottom.\nMarked on the figure are the dual shoulders and duplicate heads. The volume\nfor the head-and-shoulders pattern is what you would expect: highest on the\nleft shoulder, diminished on the head, and quite low on the right shoulder.\nOnly after price gaps upward does volume spike higher for 2 days before recov-\nering and trending downward.\nThe island top on the right of the figure is somewhat difficult to spot\nbecause of the large gap on the left that matches the small one on the right. It\nonly takes a few days for prices to reach their high before easing down. When\nprices gap lower at the end of March, volume does not budge.\nIdentification Guidelines\n467\nTable 30.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nShape\nGaps set off both island tops and bottoms and share all or part of\nthe same price level.

Going against the market is like\ntrying to cross a six-lane highway on foot: It is possible but dangerous.\nSince all islands have a gap on the breakout day, I used the intraday low\n(upward breakouts) or intraday high (downward breakouts) the day after the\nbreakout as the breakout price. This delay assumes you bought at the best\nprice the day after the breakout.

      "text": "Days to ultimate high or low. Patterns in a bull market with an upward\nbreakout took more than twice as long as the other combinations to reach the\nultimate high or low. Notice that islands in a bear market with a downward\nbreakout took 34 days compared to 128 in a bull market (up breakout). Since\nboth travel the same distance, 23%, the decline must be dramatically steeper\nthan the rise in a bull market. The implication here is that you should be in\ncash instead of holding stock in a bear market.\nTable 30.3 shows failure rates for islands. For example, 18% of islands in\na bull market with an upward breakout failed to rise more than 5%. Nearly\nhalf, 47%, failed to rise more than 15%. For downward breakouts, read the\ntable the same way. In a bear market, 5% failed to drop more than 5% after the\nbreakout. This is the lowest failure rate of the bunch. Nearly half (47%) failed\nto drop more than 20%.\nIslands in a bear market with downward breakouts do well (have the low-\nest failure rates) until the decline reaches 30%. After that, bull markets, upward\nbreakouts outperform by having the lowest failure rates.\nNotice how the rates progress in each column. For example, in a bear\nmarket with an upward breakout, the failure rate triples from 10% to 29% and\nnearly doubles again to 47% for price moves of 5%, 10%, and 15%. This\ntripling and doubling is common for chart patterns. It suggests that good per-\nformers are hard to find, so you need every break you can get. That is why\nthings like trading with the market trend, using stops, and selling at a profit\nwhen the stock, industry, and general market begin showing weakness can spell\nthe difference between a millionaire trader and a homeless investor.\nTable 30.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.\n472\nIsland Reversals\nTable 30.3\nFailure Rates\nMaximum \nBull \nBear\nBull\nBear\nPrice Rise\nMarket, \nMarket, \nMarket, \nMarket,\nor Decline \nUp \nUp \nDown \nDown \n(%)\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\n5 (breakeven)\n62 or 18%\n12 or 10%\n49 or 17%\n8 or 5%\n10\n125 or 36%\n34 or 29%\n119 or 41%\n38 or 23%\n15\n163 or 47%\n55 or 47%\n160 or 55%\n54 or 33%\n20\n196 or 57%\n71 or 60%\n199 or 69%\n78 or 47%\n25\n218 or 63%\n78 or 66%\n218 or 75%\n93 or 56%\n30\n234 or 68%\n84 or 71%\n239 or 83%\n111 or 67%\n35\n248 or 72%\n89 or 75%\n255 or 88%\n129 or 78%\n50\n285 or 83%\n106 or 90%\n281 or 97%\n156 or 95%\n75\n317 or 92%\n117 or 99%\n289 or 100%\n165 or 100%\nOver 75\n345 or 100%\n118 or 100%\n289 or 100%\n165 or 100%\n",

Since this event may occur over a weekend or a holiday, the aver-\nage time to the breakout from the island end is 1 or 2 days.\nYearly position. These numbers tell me that islands happen anywhere in\nthe yearly price range. For example, islands in bull markets with upward break-\nouts happen most often when the breakout is near the yearly high.

Those do best when the downward breakout is near the yearly high.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks occur often for\nislands (between 59% and 75% of the time), suggesting that the second island\ngap closes quickly. The time to complete the return to the breakout price\nvaries from 6 to 9 days, which is unusually fast (11 or 12 days is more typical).\nWhen a throwback or pullback occurs, performance suffers. For example,\nislands in a bull market with upward breakouts and a throwback climb 18%\nafter the breakout. When a throwback does not occur, the rise measures\n38%—a substantial difference.\nBefore you trade islands, check for underlying support or overhead resis-\ntance. If a stock has nearby support or resistance, then consider looking for a\nmore promising situation. After all, once a throwback or pullback occurs, the\nprice may continue moving in the adverse direction, setting you up for a loss.\nTable 30.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow.

Since pullbacks and throwbacks occur a majority of the time and\nsince island reversals have a low failure rate but poor performance, it is wise to\nwait for the retrace. It usually occurs a week or two after the second gap. If a\npullback or throwback does not occur quickly (in less than a month), then\nmove on to the next trading situation.\nWhen a pullback or throwback occurs, do not invest immediately. Wait\nfor the retrace to complete and for prices to turn around and resume their orig-\ninal direction. Sometimes prices retrace to the formation, then continue mov-\ning in the adverse direction.\nWatch trend lines. In the Focus on Failures section of this chapter I dis-\ncuss the use of the trend line in detail, so there is not much added here. How-\never, both up and down trend lines can show a trend change. Wait for prices\nto close above a down trend line or below an up trend line before pulling the\ntrigger.

He\nwatched the semiconductor company’s stock plummet. During November and\nDecember, the stock formed a long island consolidation. He knew it was not a\nreversal because the two gaps did not line up across from each other. Then\nanother island formed in January to early February.\nSince prices gapped down to the second formation then gapped up away\nfrom it, he knew he was dealing with an island bottom, a better investment\nchoice for performance than an island top. He used the measure rule to gauge\nthe likely price to which the stock would climb. The target represented nearly\na 30% rise in price, large enough to risk a trade.\nBefore he bought the stock, he made a few checks. He saw that the trend\nwas down, as the stock had fallen from a high of 61.13 to the island low of\n17.50. Clarence drew the trend line from the highest high downward and saw\nit go through the right island gap. This was a good sign as prices had moved\nabove the line and closed there. It signaled a possible trend change.\nStill, something did not feel right about the stock. It had made a new low\nand the semiconductor industry as a whole was soft. Did the island bottom\nreally mark a turning point or would the stock simply rise up, spin around, and\nretest the low? He was unsure, so he decided to wait and see if prices threw\nback to the formation. If they threw back then continued higher, he would buy\nthe stock. Three days after the upward breakout, the stock threw back and\nclosed the gap. Now, Clarence knew, all the stock had to do was move higher.\nIt did not.

When I first started looking for island reversals years ago, I thought\nlong islands qualified. They do not. The difference between a long island and\nan island reversal is the gap alignment. With island reversals, the two gaps\nmust share the same price. With long islands, the gap price is usually different.\nWhen I started searching for long islands, I found them everywhere, so I\nraised the qualifications until I had a workable number. The Identification\nGuidelines section discusses the qualifications I settled on.\nLong islands are average performers. Most of the time, the break-even\nfailure rates are quite low and the average decline is good. The average rise is\nshy of outstanding as it tops out at just 31% in a bull market.\nSurprises are the usual lot and most need no explanation. The exception:\nIslands tend to get shorter as they approach the end of the trend. That obser-\nvation can help you avoid an unprofitable trade and help you predict a coming\ntrend change.\nTour\nBy now, you may be wondering what a long island looks like.

      "text": "Unaligned gaps. Look for two gaps that do not share the same price. If\nthey do have prices in common, then you are looking at an island reversal. I did\nnot exclude island reversals in my study of islands, but they made up only 18%\nof the samples. An island reversal is also a long island, but a long island is not\nnecessarily an island reversal.\nWide gaps. Small gaps occur frequently, so I looked for gaps at least $1\nwide. This parameter cut the number of islands dramatically, but I still found\nalmost 1,000 in just over 200 stocks.\nShort length. I chose islands that were less than 4 months long. This\ntime frame is longer than a fiscal quarter (3 months) and yet is not too long to\nbe invisible (think of a double bottom with bottoms a year apart . . . how many\ntraders will notice?).\nU-shaped volume. When price gaps, volume usually explodes then\nrecedes. This behavior gives the typical long island a U-shaped volume pattern.\nDo not exclude a long island simply because of the volume pattern, especially\nsince those with dome-shaped volume usually perform better.\nIslands in sequence. When multiple islands appear in the same price\ntrend, they tend to get shorter in length. Figure 31.2 shows an example of this\nbehavior. The first island on the far left (gaps 1 and 2) is wider than the fol-\nlowing one (gaps 2 and 3) and island 3–4 is the shortest of the lot. The 3–4\nisland marks the end of the uptrend.\nBreakout. A breakout occurs on the second gap.\nUsing these identification guidelines, long islands are both plentiful and\nhighly visible on the daily chart.\nFocus on Failures\nFigure 31.3 shows what an island failure looks like. The figure is an example of\nwhat happened to airline stocks when the tragic event of September 11, 2001,\noccurred. The stock market closed for a week and when it reopened, airline\nstocks gapped downward (gap 1). From then on, price continued lower for sev-\neral days, then bounced, and made a slightly lower low. Then the stock recov-\nered and formed a symmetrical triangle.\nIn mid-November, the stock gapped downward (gap 2) and other airline\nstocks also showed weakness on that day, but I do not know why. I do know\nthat it was less than 2 weeks after the release of quarterly numbers. The down-\nward breakout was short-lived as price recovered the next day and continued\nmoving higher.\nThis is a good example of the need for a stop-loss order. A stop would\nhave limited losses if a trader shorted the stock after the downward breakout.\nWithout a stop, a trader would have seen the price climb from a low of 14.85\nto a high of 35.25 less than 4 months later, a rise of 137%.\nThe good news is that losses of this nature, where price moves less than\n5% in the breakout direction (a busted pattern), are rare except in a bull mar-\n484\nIslands, Long\n",

Also, since the move in the first week is usually a large one, be sure to\nget in quickly then protect yourself with stops.\nSample Trade\nFigure 31.4 shows the sample trade discussed in this section. I chose Delta\nbecause of its similarity to Figure 31.3, Continental, just after September 11,\n2001. Both have large, one-day bearish gaps on that day but recovered. The\nbounce in Figure 31.4 carries prices from point 3 to 4 then slides to 2, com-\npleting the dead cat bounce chart pattern. At point 2, the long island forms\nwhen price gaps downward.\nAs a position trader—one that holds stocks for days, months or even\nyears—I would not have shorted this stock. I build my database the day after\nthe market closes. Seeing the downward gap at point 2, I would have asked my\nbroker for a quote and found price moving higher (note the intraday low the\nday after point 2 is well above the prior close). If the stock is moving up, why\nrisk a short sale?\nThis long island represents an opportunity to trade after the ultimate low\nand participate in an average 48% recovery (see Table 31.2, “Change after\ntrend ends,” and note that this is not a busted pattern because prices drop 8%).\nThe stock reached bottom at point 3, bounced, and retested the low at 2.

By the end\nof February, the other airline stocks rejoined the squadron and resumed the\nupward move.\nA trend line, shown as “Sell Line 2” in Figure 31.4, was the sell signal.\nThat trend line did not last long because prices climbed at a steeper slope. Sell\nLine 1 connected the lows and was the new sell signal. When price closed\nbelow the trend line, it was time to sell. All but one of the other airline stocks\npeaked in late February or during March.\nThe general market, using the S&P 500 index as the proxy, also peaked in\nearly March, bumping up against a horizontal trend line set by peaks in\nDecember and January. The peaks formed a right-angled, descending broad-\nening wedge. That mouthful means a pattern with a flat top and down-sloping\ntrend line along the bottoms. The index touched the horizontal trend line in\nearly March and again in mid-March, but seemed reluctant or unable to punch\nthrough. The second touch was higher but by less than a point. The failure to\nmake a significant new high was another warning signal of a trend change.\nLike a bump-and-run reversal top, a chart pattern that shows increasing\nmomentum by steeper sloping trend lines, the party had to end sometime. Price\ncannot continue moving upward at such a rate. So, selling at one of the two\ntrend lines made sense especially since many of the other airline stocks were\nmaking lower highs by April.

With other patterns, I gauge the term by the time to the\nultimate low, but with MMDs, I am using the pattern length instead.\nI do not show the average decline or the failure rate. The average decline\nmeasures the move from the breakout to the ultimate low, and neither applies\nto this pattern. The failure rate is a measure of how far price moves after the\nbreakout. That also does not apply. \nThe Results Snapshot is self-explanatory with a few exceptions. The\n“Average corrective phase retrace” is how far prices move back up the first leg.\nIn both markets, prices retrace nearly half the first leg move. \nThe second leg is longer than the first one between 35% and 39% of the\ntime on a dollar, not a percentage, basis. On the time scale, about half (53% in\na bull market and 49% in a bear market) of the second legs are longer than the\nfirst ones. \nWhat does this information mean? If you measure the first leg price\ndecline and project it downward from the top of the corrective phase, you will\nhit your target between 35% and 39% of the time. If you take half of the first\nleg move and project downward, you will hit your target between 83% and\n93% of the time. On a percentage basis, however, the first and second leg\ndeclines are about equal.\nA surprising finding that helps with gauging performance is the retrace\namount of the corrective phase. Large retraces, over 62%, are more likely to be\nfollowed by a second leg decline that matches or exceeds the first leg decline.\nSmall retraces (less than 38% of the first leg move) show a larger likelihood of\nthe second leg being shorter than the first. Also, the decline is steeper and price\ntravels farther in a bear market than in a bull market. That should not be a sur-\nprise because MMDs are a bearish chart pattern. Finally, MMDs with U-\nshaped volume tend to have second legs that are as long as or longer than the\nfirst leg decline.\nTour\nFigure 32.1 shows what a typical measured move down looks like. The decline\nfrom the high (point A) to the start of the retrace (point C) is called the first leg.\nThe retrace is commonly referred to as the corrective phase and the remaining\ndecline to the low is called the second leg. The first and second legs are nearly\nthe same size, but their behavior is described in more detail later in the Statis-\ntics section.\nThe corrective phase is simply an upward retrace of the downtrend. It is\na place for the stock to catch its breath and for novice investors to buy into the\nsituation. They purchase the stock and push it up, believing the decline is at an\nend.

      "text": "Second leg. When the second leg begins, the downturn resumes. Prices\nusually follow the slope set by the first leg but this varies from formation to for-\nmation. Of course, the two legs will not share the same trend line since the cor-\nrective phase offsets them. Even so, the second leg usually fits inside its own\ntrend channel as prices decline in a straight-line fashion. The second leg\ndecline approximates the price decline set by the first leg and the time it took\nto accomplish it.\nAvoid. There are several guidelines that you should follow when search-\ning for the measured move down. Avoid formations that show a rounded first\nleg, where prices move lower but curve around in a sort of rounding turn, scal-\nlop, or saucer. The trend should be a straight-line decline.\nDuring the corrective phase, prices should not rebound (or come close) to\nthe high set by the first leg. If prices near or rise above the first leg high, then\navoid the formation.\nWatch for consecutive measured moves in a declining price trend. The\ndowntrend eventually will end, so it is best to trade on the first or second mea-\nsured move and avoid the rest.\nOccasionally, the prevailing price trend will be horizontal. Prices rise up\nand reach a high then begin down in the first leg. When prices return to the\nbase, they bounce. This bounce, wrongly interpreted as the corrective phase of\na measured move down, is really a minor high in a consolidation trend. Prices\nreturn to the base and may bounce several more times before beginning a sus-\ntained move upward. The overall picture looks like a horizontal saw-tooth for-\nmation. Avoid measured moves that spring from a horizontal trend.\nThe last caveat is to consider the measure rule. I discuss the measure rule\nin the Trading Tactics section of this chapter, but the measure rule says the\nIdentification Guidelines\n499\nTable 32.1\nIdentification Characteristics \nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nFirst leg\nUsually begins from a new high. Prices decline rapidly in a straight-\nline fashion. Avoid declines that curve (they are rounding turns,\nscallops, or saucers).\nCorrective phase\nPrices can move horizontally but usually rise and recover from 38%\nto 62% of the prior decline before resuming the downtrend. If the\ncorrective phase nears or rises above the first leg high, look\nelsewhere.\nSecond leg\nThe slope of the first leg down trend line often carries onto this leg.\nBoth legs usually fit inside their own trend channels.\nAvoid\nFor cascading measured moves, use the first retrace and not later\nones as they get progressively closer to the end of the trend. Avoid\nhorizontal, saw-tooth consolidation regions and measured moves\nthat rise from a flat base. Make sure the measure rule does not\npredict prices will fall below zero.\n",

In a near straight-line run, the stock tumbles from a high of 33.50\nto a low of 9.13.\nIf this decline marks the first leg of a measured move down, how far will\nprices fall in the second leg? That depends on how far up the corrective phase\nbrings prices. The corrective phase rises to a high of 15.25. I discuss the mea-\nsure rule later, but it says the second leg approximates the price decline of the\nfirst leg. If we run through the computations, we discover that the predicted\ndecline is minus 9.13. Even if the company were to declare bankruptcy, its\nstock price would never go negative. \nAnother key to this failure is the size of the corrective phase. Usually,\nprices recover 38% to 62% of the first leg decline, but this one does not come\nclose (about a 25% retrace). With larger price declines, the corrective phase is\nproportionally larger too.

When prices move up in August and reach a\nminor high in September, it is nothing unusual. Although the prior minor\nhighs do not ascend to this height, there is no reason to suspect that a measured\nmove will follow.\nWhen prices decline to the base at 40 and bounce, a naive investor might\nthink a measured move down is forming. The corrective phase in late October\nand early November sees prices rebound far up the first leg before curling over\nand heading down. If the investor sells short at this point, it will be a costly mis-\ntake. Prices quickly skyrocket to 60 by May from the second leg low of 44.88.\nWhy does this formation fail?

He\nwatched the stock climb from a low of about 10 in June 1994 to a high of 53.63\nin October 1995. Every so often, he would draw trend lines along the bottoms\nof the minor lows and notice how the upward trend seemed to be accelerating\n(the trend lines grew steeper over time).\nSince he knew this could not last, he was ready for a trend change, which\noccurred on November 14 when prices pierced the trend line, moving down.\n508\nMeasured Move Down\n",

Once the correction completes, prices climb\neven more rapidly during the second leg. You can see that prices bow upward\ninstead of touching the trend line in a sort of rounding-over maneuver before\ntopping out in June. The rise constitutes what is commonly called the second\nleg. It is the rise from the corrective phase to the end of the formation.\nOnce the formation completes, prices sometimes drop back to the level of\nthe corrective phase or lower.

The retrace is usually proportional\nto the first leg rise: Large retraces follow large rises.

This is a\nwarning sign. There is a common Street axiom that says rising prices need high\nvolume but falling prices can decline on their own weight. This formation appears\nto be an example of that axiom. Since there is little upward buying pressure to\npush prices higher, momentum fades out just below the prior top and then prices\ntumble. The resulting decline sees prices fall below the start of the first leg.\nBefore we move on to statistics, I want to alert you to some identification\nproblems. When prices rise steadily for a long time, say over a year or more,\nthen begin a MMU, the corrective phase might be excessively choppy. I men-\ntioned this behavior in the Identification Guidelines section and in Table 33.1,\nbut it is something to keep in mind.\nAlso, do not be too quick to buy into the situation. Remember that the\ncorrective phase should be proportional to the first leg rise. By that I mean\nprices should fall anywhere from 40% to 60% of the first leg move before\nbeginning the second leg. If prices only fall 15% before turning up, then it\nmight be a false breakout.\nSometimes prior peaks are a key to how far prices retrace. These minor\nhighs are often places of support. When prices decline to that level, they pause\nand move horizontally for a time before continuing down or rebounding. Vol-\nume is often a key to the level of support you can expect from these types of sit-\nuations. A prior peak with high turnover will give more support to a stock on\nits way down. That is not to say that the stock will not burn through the sup-\nport, just that it might take more of a push to fall off the cliff.\nStatistics\nThe tables in this section differ from those given in other chapters because of\nthe uniqueness of this chart pattern. Many of the statistics provided elsewhere\ndo not apply because there is no breakout and no ultimate low or high. Table\n33.2 shows general statistics for MMUs.\nNumber of formations.

Thus, you could use the bottom of the\ncorrective phase as a stop loss price. That would allow price to resume its climb\nabout half the time. The other half of the time, the stop will protect you from\na more massive loss. The bad news is that a decline to the corrective phase may\nmean a large profit giveback.\nIf you are a swing trader, you might sell as price nears the target (the sec-\nond leg high) and buy back after it rebounds in the corrective phase. Holding\nonto the stock after the MMU completes means you are willing to suffer\nthrough the average 26% to 27% price decline (see “Change after trend ends”\nin Table 33.2).\nTrading Tactics\nTable 33.5 shows trading tactics for measured move up formations.\nMeasure rule. The measure rule predicts the level to which prices will\nrise. To estimate the target price, compute the height of the first leg. I use the\nmeasured move up formation shown in Figure 33.4 as an example. Locate the\nhighest high in the first leg. Usually this is somewhere near the beginning of\nthe corrective phase, and point A indicates this in the figure. From this value\n(21.13), subtract the lowest low (14.13) in the first leg, shown as point B. The\ndifference (7) is the height of the first leg. Add it to point C (18.38)—or the\nlowest low in the corrective phase—to arrive at the target price. In this case,\nthe target price is 25.38. Prices reach the target just 10 trading days after the\ncorrective phase ends.\nUsing the full length of first leg projected upward works 45% of the time\nin a bull market and 56% of the time in a bear market. A better method is to\nuse half the first leg move. That would work 85% of the time in a bull market\nand 99.6% of the time in a bear market. Do not let the bear market number\nfool you.

Whatever the\ncase, be aware that if you do not sell near the target price and decide to hold on,\nyou might lose all your gains.\nSample Trade\nMichelle is an engineer. Over the years, she has developed a thick skin to take\nthe ribbing from her college colleagues in a male-dominated profession. Even\nwhen she ventured into the professional environment after college, the ribbing\ncontinued. Make no mistake: She is pretty and they just wanted her attention.\nI saw this firsthand when I stopped by her office with a question. She was not\nthere at the time, but her desk blotter had the scribblings of love notes from\ndozens of men. Of course, I added my own, but I digress.\nIf you were to give a Rubic’s cube to Michelle, she would not necessarily\nsolve it. First, she would want to take it apart to see how it is constructed. This\ninquisitiveness coupled with her ability to solve tough problems in a unique\nway makes her special even among engineers. She is also an investor with the\nsame qualities.\nMichelle had a unique way to take advantage of the situation shown in\nFigure 33.4. She already owned the stock but believed it was running out of\nsteam. During the prior November to February period (not shown), she saw\nthe stock form a double top. Prices declined from a high of 24.13 to the low of\n14.13 at the start of the measured move.\nUnfortunately, as a novice investor, she was unable to pull the trigger and\nsell it after prices confirmed the double top. She rode the decline down to the\nlow and saw 41% of her gains evaporate. When the stock began moving up, she\nbreathed easier. Still, she vowed to do better the next time. As the stock started\nits climb, she saw the increase in volume. The increase meant that the run\nwould be an extended one, as there seemed to be enough enthusiasm to send\nprices higher.\nAll bull runs must pause now and again and this situation was no differ-\nent. Michelle saw the stock pause and consolidate for nearly a month during\nJuly. She looked back at the chart and noticed that the stock had reached a zone\nof resistance where there were several old highs that stalled prices near the 21\n520\nMeasured Move Up\n",

Michelle calculated that the stock would rise to 25.38, a new yearly high.\nShe suspected that the stock might find resistance at the old highs of 24, and\nthat is exactly what happened. A symmetrical triangle formed in the stock. The\nformation obeyed the rules for symmetrical triangles, lower highs and higher\nlows with a receding volume pattern, and she was confident that she had cor-\nrectly identified it.\nSince there was no way to tell which direction the stock would break out\nof the triangle, she sat tight. Then prices gapped out the top. Was the gap a\nbreakaway gap or an exhaustion gap? She reasoned that since the gap appeared\njust after a region of consolidation, it was most likely a breakaway gap, so prices\nwould continue rising, but how far? She hoped the triangle represented the\nhalfway mark of an up move. She knew that symmetrical triangle formations\nsometimes act like half-staff formations, so she expected a climb to 28 (see the\nmeasure rule for symmetrical triangles). To her it sounded like a long shot, but\none worth waiting for. Her calculated price target of 25.38 was met the day\nprices jumped out of the triangle.\nAbout a week after prices left the triangle, they reached a new high and\nthen fell back. When price closed the gap in the first part of September, she\ndecided to sell her holdings. Fortunately, the next day prices zoomed upward\nand she was able to sell her shares at 24.50, near the daily high of 25.13. After\nthat, the stock tumbled back to the middle of the corrective phase, right in the\ncenter of the support zone. Then, the stock recovered. As the stock climbed and\nposted a new high, she wondered if she had sold too soon. She felt better after\nreviewing the chart 6 months later and seeing prices hovering in the $15 range.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select MMUs that\noutperform. Consult the associated table for more information.\n• Review the identification guidelines for correct selection—Table 33.1.\n• On a percentage basis, the second leg is about two-thirds the length of\nthe first leg (bull market). In a bear market, the second leg is margin-\nally shorter (by four percentage points)—Table 33.2.\n• In a bull market, the average length of the first leg is 11% shorter than\nis the second on a dollar basis. In a bear market, the second leg is 8%\nlonger—Table 33.2.\n• Select patterns with a rising volume trend—Table 33.3.\n• After the MMU ends, prices stop declining above or within the cor-\nrective phase between 54% to 64% of the time—Table 33.4.\nFor Best Performance\n521\n",

Upward breakouts\nare about a week shorter, but downward breakouts have a postbreakout trend\nthat mirrors the pre-formation trend length.\nTo gauge the price move, for upward breakouts, I used the trend start low\nto the pennant high (price move before the pennant) and from the breakout\nday low price to the trend end high (price move after the pennant). For down-\nward breakouts, I measured from the trend start high price to the pennant low\n(price move before the pennant) and from the breakout day high price to the\ntrend low (price move after the pennant).\nThe prior price move is longer than the post price move in all cases.\nThus, set price targets conservatively because the price move after the break-\nout will usually be shorter than the price move leading to the pennant.\nTable 34.7 shows volume-related statistics.\nVolume trend.

Pennants are for short-term\n(swing) traders, not for buy-and-hold investors.\nMeasure rule. Use the measure rule to help predict a price target. Fig-\nure 34.5 shows an example. The trend starts at point A and climbs to the pen-\nnant. Take the difference between the top (intraday high) of the pennant at its\nstart (B at 10.69) and the trend start low (point A, at 7.50) to get the trend\nheight of 3.19. Add this value to the intraday low at the pennant end (point C\nat 11.44, the day before the breakout) to get the price target (14.63). Price\nclimbs to the target 3 days after the breakout.\nWarning: This method works between half (bear markets) and two-thirds\nof the time (bull markets), so be conservative in your estimate.\nWait for breakout. Since pennants do reverse on occasion, it is best to\nwait for the breakout. A breakout occurs when price closes outside the pennant\nboundary. Only then should you take a position in the stock. Do not procras-\ntinate, as delays will be costly.\nClose out the trade. Price should move in the direction of the prevail-\ning price trend, usually following a slope similar to that before the pennant.\nWhen price falters (pauses), sell.\nSample Trade\nConsider the situation shown in Figure 34.5. The pennant obeys the identifi-\ncation guidelines shown in Table 34.1. The pennant looks odd because price\ntrends upward in the pennant instead of declining. In that regard, the pennant\nis unusual, but it is still a pennant.\nSample Trade\n533\nTable 34.8\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nCalculate the price difference between the start of the trend and the\npennant.

Many technical traders look for this type of situation—\na heavy volume breakout after a long horizontal move. They say that the\nlonger the base, the more powerful the move up. Based on this example alone,\nI would have to agree.\nYou can see how price punched through the base’s ceiling on high volume\nthen coasted higher, forming the pennant. Once price shot out the top (a close\noutside the pennant trend line), the stage was set for a trade.\nMany technical traders would have entered this trade on the breakout\nfrom the base (when price closed above the base’s top), allowing them to profit\non the ride up. Using the pennant as a measure rule sell signal would be a\nbonus.\nSuppose you saw the pennant form and watched price break out. The\nnext day, you would buy at the market open, filled at 12.53, which was also the\nintraday low.\nPrice rises toward the measure rule target of 14.63. Stay in the trade as\nprice makes higher highs. You can place an order to sell near the target so the\nmarket will take you out automatically. That order usually results in selling\nnear a minor high and gives you a higher profit than trying to time it yourself.\nIn this case, since price was trending up, stay in the trade.

Pipe bottoms are an exciting\ndiscovery with a low failure rate (5%) and a high average rise (45%) in a bull\nmarket.\nI conducted an in-depth study of pipe bottoms on daily price charts and\ncame up disappointed. The statistics show that daily pipes have a failure rate of\n18% with an average gain of 33%. Almost half the formations (45%) have\ngains less than 20%. However, there are a number of large gains; almost a\nquarter of the formations (23%) have gains over 50%.\nI began to believe that an investor trading daily pipes would either pick a\nformation that fails or one that has such a small gain as to be unprofitable, so I\ndiscarded the research and looked at the weekly chart. As you can see from the\npreceding numbers, the performance is quite good. Not only is this formation\nworth exploring further, it just might be an outstanding performer worth\nadding to your technical toolbox.\nThe only surprise that needs explaining is inside and outside weeks. An\ninside week is one in which the right spike’s trading range is inside the trading\nrange of the prior week. An outside week is the reverse, with a higher high and\nlower low than the prior week. Pipes that are inside weeks perform better than\noutside weeks.\nTour\nFigure 35.1 shows a pipe formation and the price appreciation that results. The\nchart is on the weekly scale and you can see that prices begin dropping in mid-\nOctober, 1993, down to the pipe pattern. Volume picks up during the left pipe\nspike and is even higher the following week. The two downward price spikes,\nof almost equal length and overlapping, mark a turning point, a signal that the\ndecline is over.\nFrom the low, prices move up smartly and reach a new high in early\nNovember, a climb of almost 120% in just 9 months. For this formation, such\nlarge gains are not unusual. Almost 20% of the pipes in a bull market have\ngains over 90%.\nIdentification Guidelines\nHow do you correctly identify pipe bottoms?

However, the right\nside shows higher than average volume in both formations. Still, the volume\npattern is unconvincing, as it usually appears most brisk at pipe bottoms. As a\ncontrast, look at the pipe on the far left side of the chart. Both spikes show vol-\nume that is well above average.\nAnother clue to the failures lies buried in the guidelines outlined in Table\n35.1. Prices should drop unusually far during the 2 weeks, more than most down-\nward price thrusts during the year. As you look at the chart, you can see several\ndownward, 1-week spikes (December and February, for example) that nearly\nequal the length of the two pipe formations. The entire chart seems filled with\nragged price spikes of varying lengths. For this reason, you should be skeptical\nof investing in these two pipes.\nThe pipe failures shown in Figure 35.3 are not pipes at all because price\ndoes not close above the highest high in the pattern.

Since pipes often appear at the end of a\ndownward price trend, prices sometimes rise up, loop around, and retest the\nlow. The pipe in early December 1991 is an example. Prices bounce upward,\nround over, and fall back on themselves, forming a new low at 98.13. The\nretest of the original low completes in late March.\nPipe bottoms exhibit support at their lows. Rarely do prices drop more\nthan a half a point or so below the pipe low before recovering and beginning\nan extended upward trend. The half point is not an absolute rule as it depends\non the price of the stock (the one shown in the chart is a $100 stock and it\ndrops $1 below the prior low).\nSo even though you may buy into a stock above the top of the pipe and\nwatch prices fall, hold on.\nStatistics\nTable 35.2 shows general statistics for pipes.\nNumber of formations. Pipes are everywhere. I needed only 200 stocks in\na bull market (mid-1991 to mid-1996) to find almost 1,000 patterns. For the bear\nmarket, I used about 220 stocks bracketing the bear market from 2000 to 2003.\nReversal or continuation. Pipes bottoms are, by definition, reversals of\nthe downward price trend because price breaks out upward after the pattern.\nAverage rise. The average rise in a bull market is a huge 45%! In a bear\nmarket, the pattern performs less well, rising an average of 32%. Trade this\npattern in a bull market for the best results.\nStatistics\n541\n",

In a bear market, over a quarter\n(30%) of the patterns exceed the 45% benchmark.\nChange after trend ends. Once price reaches the ultimate high, it tum-\nbles between 33% and 36%, depending on market conditions. As you might\nexpect, price falls farther in a bear market than in a bull market. That observa-\ntion suggests you go short in a bear market, not in a bull one.\nBusted pattern performance. Busted patterns show similar perfor-\nmance numbers to the prior row. While the change after the trend ends shows\nwhat happens to all pipes, busted patterns include only those with upward\nmoves less than 5% before they tumble. Before trading a busted pattern, wait\nfor price to close below the low in the pipe. That way, you can expect price to\ncontinue tumbling.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change.

It takes a long time (4 to 6 months) to climb 32%\nto 45% (the average rise for pipes in bear and bull markets, respectively). The\nnumbers show that the rise in a bear market is slightly steeper than the rise in\na bull market.\nTable 35.3 shows failure rates for pipes. The bear market starts with the\nlowest failure rate, but the bull market beats it for rises above 5%.\nHow do you read the table? For example, 22% of the bull market pipes\nfail to rise at least 15%. In a bear market, 26% fail to climb at least 15%. Half\nthe patterns in a bull market climb less than 35% and half in a bear market\nclimb less than 30%.\nUse Table 35.3 to estimate how likely it will be to meet your cost of\ndoing business and any profit margin you want to maintain. For example, say\nyour cost is 10% and you want to make 10% on each trade, for a 20% total.\n542\nPipe Bottoms\nTable 35.2\nGeneral Statistics\nDescription\nBull Market\nBear Market\nNumber of formations\n926\n226\nReversal (R), continuation (C)\n926 R\n226 R\nAverage rise\n45%\n32%\nRises over 45%\n361 or 39%\n67 or 30%\nChange after trend ends\n–33%\n–36%\nBusted pattern performance\n–28%\n–30%\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change\n15%\n1%\nDays to ultimate high\n194\n133\nNote: Minus sign means decline.\n",

Where in the yearly price range do the\nbest performing pipes occur? In a bull market, pipes with breakouts within a\nthird of the yearly high perform best. With the emphasis on momentum, this\nfinding makes sense. Traders buy stocks near the yearly high, forcing price\neven higher. That factor is one reason why you should not short a stock mak-\ning new highs.\nIn a bear market, pipes near the yearly low do well. Investors may buy\nthem because they see the price as a bargain, reasoning that price will rebound\nfarther if they buy near the yearly low. Buying stocks near the yearly low is\ndangerous because price often continues falling.\nThrowbacks. A throwback occurs about half the time, with the rate\nslightly lower in a bull market. It takes about 2 weeks for price to complete a\nreturn to the breakout price. The throwback takes longer than the usual 9 to\n12 days because of the weekly scale.\nOne of the surprising results is that pipes with throwbacks perform less\nwell than those without.

In both bull and bear markets, pipes that are inside\nweeks performed better than do those that were outside weeks.

The uptrend ranges\nfrom several months to over a year, and the pipes seem to signal a coming trend\nchange. Sometimes they do and prices drop, but by less than 5%. At other\ntimes, the drop is more severe, but it is in the future, from 2 to 5 or more\nmonths ahead. In between the pipe and the drop, there are higher prices.\nSprinkled among the uptrend failures are those related to downtrends.\nPipes usually appear at the end of a long downtrend or shortly after the trend\nchanges and begins moving up. Instead of an upward retrace in a downtrend,\nthe pipe marks the turning point for higher prices.\nConsider Figure 36.3, a pipe top in a stock that has been moving sideways\nfor about a year.

For many chart for-\nmations, even those that have a measure rule to predict what the eventual price\nwill be, there is still one overriding rule: There must be something to reverse.\nYou can see that the consolidation region narrows over time, reminiscent\nof a long, symmetrical triangle. Even the volume pattern supports the forma-\ntion by receding most of the way along the chart pattern. Since the boundaries\nof a symmetrical triangle mark lines of support and resistance, the possible\ndecline from the pipe base to the triangle boundary is just 5%, not a very com-\npelling investment. In essence, there just is not much of a climb to reverse.\nHowever, in all fairness, if the pipe correctly predicted a downward break-\nout from the triangle, I would be telling you a different story. Since it is diffi-\ncult or impossible to predict the breakout direction from a symmetrical\ntriangle, it is best to wait for the actual breakout. If investors waited for prices\nto close below the pipe, they could have saved themselves from a loss. As it is,\nthe pipe shown in Figure 36.3 is a failure of prices to decline.

      "text": "Reversal or continuation. Technically, a pipe top acts as reversal of the\nprevailing price trend when price enters the pattern from the bottom and\nleaves by a downward breakout. In reality, however, price will trend downward\nleading to the pipe and continue moving down after the pipe. Thus, you will\noften find that it acts as a continuation of the downward price trend.\nConfused? How about this: The pattern acts as a minor 4-week reversal\nin the midst of a longer-term trend. If the price trend is down, expect it to con-\ntinue moving down. To add fuel to the confusion, I often see pipes at the sum-\nmit of uptrends.\nAverage decline.

Prices bounce between two levels, setting up a\nsupport zone at the bottom and a line of resistance at the top.

At the other end of the scale,\n14% are still searching for the ultimate low after 70 days.\nWhat do the numbers mean? Table 37.5 shows how likely your rectangle\nwill top/bottom out over time.

Tall patterns perform better than short ones. For example, tall\nrectangles in bull markets with upward breakouts rise 66% after the breakout.\nRectangles shorter than the median show postbreakout rises of just 34%.\nWidth. Usually, wide patterns perform better than narrow ones, but the\ndifference is slight. The exception is for rectangles in bear markets with\nupward breakouts. Narrow rectangles show rises of 25% and wide ones rise\n24% after the breakout. I used the median width as the separator between nar-\nrow and wide.\nAverage formation length.

Some analysts\nsuggest measuring the length (not the height) of the rectangle, flipping it ver-\ntically, and adding or subtracting it from the top or bottom trend line to get the\nmaximum price move (for upward and downward breakouts, respectively).\nThis approach sounds a bit far-fetched, but it is a handy guideline. Use it with\ncaution as I have not verified how well it works.\nThe measure rule (vertical measure) works between 50% and 66% of the\ntime for downward breakouts and between 64% and 85% of the time for\nupward breakouts.\n576\nRectangle Bottoms\nTable 37.9\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nMeasure the height of the rectangle by subtracting the value of\nthe trend lines from each other. For upward breakouts, add the\nheight to the top trend line; for downward breakouts, subtract the\nvalue from the bottom trend line. The result is the expected mini-\nmum price move. For a maximum price target, measure the length\nof the rectangle and extend it vertically above the top trend line\n(for upward breakouts) or below the bottom one (downward\nbreakouts). The price then becomes the maximum expected move.\nWait for breakout\nSince you cannot be sure in which direction a rectangle will break\nout, wait for price to close outside the trend line before trading in\nthe direction of the breakout.\nTall rectangle scalp\nIf the rectangle is tall enough, sell or sell short near the top trend\nline and buy or cover near the bottom trend line.\nThrowbacks, \nIf you have a downward breakout, watch for a pullback and short \npullbacks\nthe stock or add to your short position once prices begin descend-\ning again. Use the same technique for an upward breakout: Wait\nfor the throwback then initiate or add to your position when\nprices rise.\nOther\nWatch for rectangles forming as the corrective phase of a\nmeasured move formation and adjust the target price accordingly.\nRectangle reversals sometimes appear as flat bottom formations.\n",

Place the trade after\nprice closes outside the rectangle trendline, and then trade with the trend.\nTall rectangle scalp. If the formation is tall enough, consider placing an\nintraformation trade near the two trend lines. Short at the top when prices\nbegin descending, and cover when they rebound off the bottom trend line (do\nnot cover too soon as prices may continue moving down). Go long at the bot-\ntom and sell at the top trend line when prices begin falling. Again, wait for a\ndirection change as prices may stage an upward breakout.\nThrowbacks, pullbacks. Throwbacks and pullbacks allow investors\nanother opportunity to place a trade, add to their position, or get out with a\nsmaller loss. Take advantage of it but wait for prices to complete their throw-\nback or pullback before placing a trade or adding to a position. The reason for\nwaiting is that prices may continue in the adverse direction instead of return-\ning to the trend line and rebounding.\nOther. Sometimes, rectangle bottoms form as the corrective phase of a\nmeasured move formation. See the Measured Move Down chapter for informa-\ntion on how to take advantage of the situation. Occasionally a rectangle will mark\nthe end of a substantial decline and appear like a flat bottom before prices rise.\nSample Trade\nFigure 37.4 shows a paper trade I made. The rectangle bottom appeared after\nprices dropped from a high of 20.63 in October 1997. The drop was a painful\none but it did not occur all at once. Prices dropped quite rapidly to 15 where\nthey moved horizontally for 8 months. Then the second half of the decline\ntook over and prices reached a low of about 11.\nPrices bounced off the low several times, like a boy taking his first steps\non a trampoline. They were tentative, shaky, with not much enthusiasm. Then\nin mid-October 1998, prices touched the bottom trend line and moved quickly\nacross the formation to tie the September high at 12.38. A few more oscilla-\ntions and the two trend-line boundaries became apparent.\nIf you look at the overall picture, you might think that prices would con-\ntinue down—a downward breakout (following the downward trend). I could\nnot tell which direction prices would go, so I decided to wait for the breakout.\nIf the formation acted as a consolidation, then the breakout would be down-\nward. However, with a two-step downtrend from the high at 20.63, this\nreminded me of a measured move down with a long corrective phase. I thought\nit might break out upward. If the rectangle were taller, I would try an intrafor-\nmation trade (buy at 11.13, sell at 12.38, and then reverse).\nIn early December, prices pierced the top trend line and closed above it;\nstaging an upward breakout. I noticed the breakout the day after it happened\nand bought the stock 13, midrange for the day.\nSample Trade\n577\n",

A better stop would have been just\nbelow the lower rectangle trend line because both trend lines act as support or\nresistance zones. However, I did not want to take such a large loss (15%+).\nEven paper trades go wrong and that is what happened here. A day after\nbuying the stock, prices returned to the rectangle formation to do more work.\nPrices slowly, agonizingly, moved lower until hitting my stop in late Decem-\nber.

After that, rectangles in bull mar-\nkets with upward breakouts do better—Table 37.3.\n• Select rectangles with upward breakouts in the middle of the yearly\ntrading range; downward breakouts near the yearly low—Table 37.4.\n• Throwbacks and pullbacks hurt performance, so look for overhead\nresistance or underlying support before trading—Table 37.4.\n• About half the rectangles with downward breakouts reach the ultimate\nlow within 3 weeks.

As a rectangle forms, prices rise to a resistance\nlevel and fall back to a support area for another try. If this pattern continues,\nthe minor highs can be joined with a trend line drawn along the top of the for-\nmation, and another trend line can be drawn below the minor lows. The two\ntrend lines are horizontal or nearly so. If there is a slight tilt to the trend line,\ndo not worry as long as it does not disturb the overall appearance of a conges-\ntion region.\nTouches. To qualify as a rectangle, prices must touch each trend line at\nleast twice. The touches need not alternate from one trend line to the other,\nbut the minor highs and lows must be distinct.

A random shape, which is neither U nor\ndome, performs exceedingly well in rectangles in a bull market with an upward\nbreakout (49% rise). However, the sample count is not robust—35—compared\nto over a hundred each for the other shapes. Thus, do not depend on a rectan-\ngle with a random volume shape delivering outstanding performance.\nBreakout volume.

On average, your profits should be larger with lower risk providing\nyou use stops to limit adverse moves. If price touches the horizontal rectangle\ntrend line and reverses instead of breaking out, close out the trade immedi-\nately. Chances are prices are going to cross the rectangle to the other side.\nWhen a partial decline occurs, performance suffers. That finding makes\nsense because the move is lower and it weakens upward momentum. However,\nwhen a partial rise occurs, performance improves, but not by much. I did not\nseparate partial rise and decline performance into bull and bear markets.\nPre-formation rises or drops. A pre-formation rise (PR) or drop (PD)\nis what I call a quick up or down move before the rectangle starts. Figure 38.1\nshows both; Figure 38.3 shows a PD.\nPre-formation rises have low sample counts and the results are all over\nthe map. Sometimes a PR helps performance (in bear markets) and sometimes\nnot (bull markets).\nWith pre-formation drops, the news is all good. When a PD occurs, per-\nformance either stays the same or, usually, improves, sometimes substantially.\nWhy this is the case is a mystery to me, but if it changes a 34% rise into a 45%\none, then it is worth paying attention to.\nTrading Tactics\nTable 38.9 explains trading tactics for rectangle tops.\nMeasure rule. The measure rule predicts the minimum target price.\nFirst, compute the height of the rectangle by subtracting the value of the lower\ntrend line from the upper one. Add the difference to the top trend line for\nupward breakouts and subtract it from the bottom trend line for downward\nbreakouts. The result is the target price.\nFor an example of the measure rule and how it applies to rectangles, con-\nsider the rectangle top pictured in Figure 38.4. The top trend line has a value of\n38.75, whereas the bottom one perches at 33.75. The difference of 5 is the height\nof the rectangle. If this rectangle were to break out downward, then the target\nprice would be 28.75, or the lower trend line value minus the formation height.\nSince the breakout is upward, add the height to the top trend line, giving a tar-\nget price of 43.75. Prices reach the target about a month after the breakout.\nI have read that to compute the maximum price move, one physically\nmeasures the length of the rectangle and applies it to the top trend line for\nupward breakouts or subtracts it from the bottom trend line for downward\nbreakouts. When using my computer, the technique comes close to the ulti-\nmate high. On paper, the results are less accurate. I have not tested this method\nextensively and cannot vouch for its accuracy. However, one has to wonder\nhow measuring a formation (in inches) can accurately translate into a price\nmove; but, who knows, the system might work or at least prove helpful.\nTrading Tactics\n591\n",

      "text": "Consolidation, breakout. Returning to Table 38.9, the breakout direc-\ntion is usually in the direction of the prior trend. For Figure 38.4 the direction\nis upward and that is the direction in which the breakout occurs. Once price\ncloses outside a formation, then a breakout (or premature breakout) occurs. If\nthe breakout is upward, go long or cover your short. If the breakout is down-\nward, then short the stock or sell your position.\nTall rectangle scalp. If the rectangle is tall enough and providing you\ndiscover it quickly enough, you can trade the formation as it swings from trend\nline to trend line. Short or sell at the top trend line and cover or buy at the bot-\ntom trend line. Keep an eye on the price trend leading to the formation in case\na breakout occurs. If the stock moves outside the rectangle trend line and you\nare losing money, close out your position. You might also want to get on the\nbandwagon and trade in the direction of the new trend.\nIf the breakout turns into a premature breakout when prices return to the\nrectangle proper, do not panic. There is still a chance that prices will resume\ntheir original breakout direction. Again, if the trade goes against you by shoot-\ning out the other side of the rectangle, then close out your position and do it\nquickly. If you hesitate, you may have another opportunity to add to your posi-\ntion or close it out if the formation pulls back or throws back. Take advantage\nof it especially if you are losing money. Often, prices will return to the forma-\ntion boundary and then turn away. If you do not get out during the pullback or\nthrowback, then it is likely your losses will grow. Do not pass up the second\nchance and do not hope that prices will continue recovering. They will not!\nOther. Before placing a trade in a rectangle formation, see if the chart pat-\ntern is part of a larger pattern. Sometimes, the rectangle is the horizontal part,\ncalled the corrective phase, of a measured move up formation. Knowing that a\nrectangle is a subpart of a measured move allows you to get a better gauge on the\nexpected price move. When the rectangle top is a reversal of the prevailing price\ntrend, the resulting formation resembles a flat top. Suspect that a reversal might\nbe under way if the price trend leading up to the rectangle is unusually steep.\nSample Trade\nDave is an artist. It is tough making a living and he wants to move to the com-\nputer world and become a graphics artist. He has been playing around with\nsome hardware and software that duplicate the feel of a brush on various tex-\ntures but wants to get the latest versions.\nRecognizing chart patterns comes easily to him. With his keen eye, he has\nbeen on the prowl for a lucrative stock play. That is one reason he stumbled\nacross the rectangle shown in Figure 38.4, but he did not spot the rectangle in a\ntimely fashion. The only reason he noticed it is because of the throwback. Throw-\nbacks and pullbacks are peculiar enough with their hooking retrace that they are\neasy to spot. One has only to look back and identify the associated formation.\nSample Trade\n593\n",

In essence, this activ-\nity represents the handle length (after the right lip). The implication here is that\nyou have plenty of time to trade this pattern, even if you do not recognize it dur-\ning development. Trade RdBs only after price closes above the right lip.\nYearly position. Most RdBs have their breakout within a third of the\nyearly high. Since the chart pattern is a long one and the breakout is near the\ntop of the pattern, the numbers are not surprising.\nYearly position, performance. Mapping performance onto the yearly\nprice range, we find that the best performing RdBs are those with breakouts\nnear the yearly high. The results may change with additional samples, espe-\ncially in a bull market.\nThrowbacks. Throwbacks occur less often in RdBs than in many other\nchart patterns, but I do not know why. Prices take the usual amount of time to\nreturn to the breakout price (9 to 12 days). When throwbacks do occur, the\npostbreakout rise averages 33% in a bull market and 28% in a bear market.\nWhen a throwback is absent, performance improves: 50% and 33%, respec-\ntively. Thus, throwbacks retard upward momentum and performance suffers.\nBefore trading, look for overhead resistance and trade patterns without it.\nGaps. Breakout day gaps hurt performance but only in a bear market—\n32% rise without a gap versus 26% with.\nTable 39.5 shows the time it takes prices to reach the ultimate high. Few\npatterns flame out in the first week. Most take over 2.5 months (70 days) to top\nout. Such a long time gives price the opportunity to make an extended move\n(on average, it takes longer to rise farther).\nNotice that a month into the trade, 9% of the patterns in a bear market\nreach the ultimate high (a slight blip). That event may be a warning sign of\nweakness. I have seen this behavior in other patterns, so if price stalls a month\ninto the trade, consider selling. Bull markets peak a week earlier.\nTable 39.6 shows size statistics for the rounding bottom pattern.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform better than short ones, especially in a bull\nmarket (52% versus 38%).

He decided to get there one trade at a time, taking a\nlonger time to trade and working down to interday trading.\nIn December, as he was flipping through his charts, he came across what\nappeared to be a mild double bottom. On the daily chart the two bottoms in\nAugust and November were barely discernible. Was it a valid formation and\nshould he buy the stock now? Glen decided that the retrace between the two\nbottoms was not high enough and the two bottoms not clear enough to be\nworth considering. He justified his action by thinking that if he was having a\nhard time spotting the formation, then others would have the same trouble. If\nno one spots the formation, then prices will not rise.\nWhen he flipped to the weekly chart, it changed the characterization of\nwhat he was seeing. On his screen was an obvious rounding bottom. The vol-\nume pattern supported the conclusion: receding as prices declined and round-\ning up as prices rose. So, he decided to wait for the rounding bottom to stop\nnear the prior saucer lip at about 21.38. When it paused for 2 weeks in Febru-\nary, he knew the formation was primed. The question then became, what was\nit going to do next? The only way to find that out was to wait.\n606\nRounding Bottoms\nAlco Standard Corp.

Volume is dome shaped, but that is\ntypical for rounding turns—it happens 43% of the time.\nBuying demand and selling pressure determines stock price movement.\nFundamentals drive those forces. If news comes out that a company is consid-\nering bankruptcy, you can be sure the stock price is going down. Most news\ninfluences price less.\nFor example, beginning in late January 2002, natural gas prices started ris-\ning and broke out upward from a symmetrical triangle in March, just as the stock\nmade a new minor high. Gas prices peaked in May and started a long slide that\nended in August. By contrast, the stock peaked in March 2002 and continued\nlower. Thus, even as natural gas was making new highs, the stock was tumbling—\n“diverging” as we call it. However, both the stock and natural gas bottomed\nwithin a few weeks of each other, with the stock leading the way higher.\nTechnical factors also influence price movement and contribute to a pat-\ntern failure. For example, if you know that Joe Trader is buying and his record\nis the envy of the industry, you may want to buy, too. This herd instinct is what\nmomentum is all about.

However, the rise in a bear market is\nnot too shabby either: 53%. The key is finding the ultimate low.

By that, I mean price moves less than 5% beyond the breakout before\nreversing and heading off in the new direction.

That\nwaiting sacrifices a majority of the move.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change. Notice how the strength of the average\nrise or decline follows the market trend.

The rise in a bull market (37% in 161\ndays) takes longer to reach the ultimate high than the decline in a bear market\n(23% in 25 days) takes to reach the ultimate low. The decline must be steeper\nthan the rise. This finding implies that you can make more trades in a bear\nmarket than in a bull one, but the profit will average considerably less.\nTable 40.3 shows failure rates for RdTs. The lowest failure rates associ-\nate with the market trend: trading long in a bull market and short in a bear\nmarket. Countertrend trades have more risk. For example, 20% of the RdTs in\nbull markets with upward breakouts fail to rise more than 10%, but in a bear\nmarket, 36% fail to rise as far. Half the patterns (51%) in a bear market fail to\ndrop more than 20%, but 57% in a bull market fail to drop 20%.\nYou can see how the failure rates start low and quickly climb for small\nchanges in the maximum price rise or decline. For example, RdTs in a bear\nmarket with downward breakouts show failures of 9%, 22%, and 39% for\ndeclines of 5%, 10%, and 15%, respectively.

      "text": "Formation end to breakout. Once prices drop to the right rim, they\ntake between 2 and 4 months, on average, to climb above the pattern’s high.\nFor downward breakouts, the delay is shorter but still quite long, about 2\nmonths (58 to 79 days).\nI expected the shortest time to the breakout to follow the market trend.\nIf a rising tide lifts all boats, then that would help the stock climb faster. That\nexplanation sounds good but the numbers suggest otherwise for both bull and\nbear markets. Another explanation is that stocks in a bear market struggling to\nrise against the outgoing (falling) tide must have a very good reason to climb.\nThe enthusiasm powers the stocks upward much faster than stocks coasting\nupward in a rising market.\nThe key to successful trading is finding stocks in a bull market that have\na need to shoot higher or finding those in a bear market that not only want to\ncrash and burn, but also dig a hole so deep as to reach the earth’s core.\nYearly position. As you might guess, upward breakouts appear near the\nyearly high and downward breakouts occur often near the yearly low.\nYearly position, performance. With most of the patterns hovering near\nthe yearly high or digging near the yearly low, the sample counts are few for\nthe other extremes. Keeping that finding in mind, RdTs perform best when the\nbreakout is near the yearly low.\nThrowbacks and pullbacks. A throwback or pullback occurs about half\nthe time. It takes, on average, 9 days for price to return to the breakout price.\nWhen a throwback or pullback occurs, performance usually suffers. The lone\nexception is for RdTs with upward breakouts in a bear market. Those with\nthrowbacks rise 20%. Without throwbacks, the rise averages 19%.\nGaps. I am not sure how important the gap performance numbers are\nbecause with a breakout up to 4 months after the end of the pattern, who is\ngoing to notice a breakout day gap? However, in all cases, gaps helped per-\nformance, sometimes substantially. Notice how large gaps are during a down-\nward breakout.\nTable 40.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Notice how many RdTs have a trend change in the first week or two. The\nworst case is for downward breakouts in a bear market. Almost 60% hit bottom\nin the first 2 weeks. That finding seems odd because the breakout direction is\nin the direction of the market trend. Thus, the down move must be violent and\nsuggests that you should short the stock before the breakout. Otherwise you\nmay miss a potentially large move (think breakaway gap on the breakout day).\nLook for the general market (S&P 500 index) and industry to be trending\ndownward, an absence of underlying support, and a price downtrend before\nthe RdT. If those conditions exist, consider shorting the stock. The stock will\nbottom at the right rim and then bounce up for a month or two. When it peaks\nduring the bounce and starts moving down again, short the stock. That move\nshould get you on the correct side of the trade before the breakout. Use a pro-\ngressive stop (lower it as price drops) in case you are wrong.\nStatistics\n617\n",

For example, in a line of three\nascending scallops, the first one will be wider and taller than the last one. Also,\na downward breakout from a scallop perched at the summit (the end of an\nupward price trend) is bearish and usually means a trend change.\nTour\nFigure 41.1 shows three ascending scallops, with the first one being an especially\nlarge one.

      "text": "Trading Tactics\nTable 41.8 shows trading tactics for ascending scallops.\nMeasure rule. The first trading tactic is to determine how far prices are\nlikely to move once the formation completes. This gauge is called the measure\nrule because it involves measuring the formation height and applying it to the\nbreakout point.\nSubtract the lowest low reached in the bowl from the high reached on the\nright side of the formation. Once you have the height, add the value to the\nhighest high on the right side (upward breakouts) or subtract it from the low-\nest low (downward breakouts). The result is the minimum expected price tar-\nget. An example makes the calculation clear. Consider the ascending scallop\nthat forms during late September as shown in Figure 41.4. Apply the measure\nrule to this formation by subtracting the formation base from the right side\nhigh. Point B shows the base low at 12.50 and the right side high, point A, is\n16. The difference of 3.50 is the formation height. Add the difference to the\nright-side high (point A) to get the target price of 19.50.

In such a case, the target would be 9 (12.50–3.50).\nHandle. Once a scallop completes, prices decline. They retrace all or a\npart of their gains (that is, from the right-edge high to the bowl low) before\nheading higher (upward breakouts) or continuing down (downward breakouts).\nIn Figure 41.4, you can see that the retrace after the first scallop brings prices\ndown to the height of the left scallop lip at 14.25.

The breakeven failure rate is low, 4% in bull markets, and\n7% in bear markets, but climbs quickly. The average postbreakout rise is 43%\nin bull markets and 26% in bear markets, both numbers are very good.\nAs noted in the Results Snapshot, a number of surprises occur with this\npattern. I will discuss them in detail later in the chapter.\nTour\nWhat does an ascending and inverted scallop look like? Figure 42.1 shows two\nexamples.

The turning point may be the start of a new upward\ntrend, but, more likely, it is the corrective phase of a measured move down. In\nother words, prices decline and then stop where the inverted scallop forms.\nIdentification Guidelines\n641\nTable 42.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nDaily chart\nUse the daily chart to find the pattern, although the larger\nones also appear on the weekly charts.\nUpward price trend\nSelect patterns that appear in an upward price trend or at\nthe bullish turning point of a downward price trend.\nInverted and backward \nPrices trend up then round over at the top, forming an \nJ shape\ninverted and backward J. It also looks like the right half of\nan umbrella.\nSmooth top\nLook for daily high prices that, when connected, form a\nsmooth turn. Larger patterns may not be as smooth\nbecause you are connecting minor highs.\nRetrace\nThe rounded top portion of the pattern usually retraces\nabout 50% of the prior up move.

They may not, but\nthat is the way to estimate your reward (overhead resistance) and risk (under-\nlying support).\nWait for confirmation. Always wait for the pattern to become valid.\nThat happens when price closes above the pattern high, and that is also the buy\nsignal. Investing in a pattern before confirmation is best left to amateurs.\nSample Trade\nRobert looked at the chart shown as Figure 42.6 and liked the stock’s rising\nprice trend starting in April. He watched the first scallop form in September\nand October. The retrace of this pattern, ending at point A, was 83%—more\nthan he liked, so he ignored the potential trade. Such a large retrace may mean\nan especially weak technical picture, and scallops with large retraces tend to\nunderperform.\nWhen the second scallop formed during late October through early\nDecember, he saw that the retrace was a more palatable 64%.\nHe ran though the identification guidelines in Table 42.1 and found the\nfollowing: On the daily chart, the pattern was in a price uptrend, it looked like\nan inverted and backward J, the top was reasonably smooth, and prices did not\ndrop below point A, the scallop’s start. Meeting those guidelines qualified the\npattern as an ascending and inverted scallop.\nThe day after price closed above the scallop’s high, he bought. That tim-\ning turned out to be wrong as prices immediately tumbled. Robert is an expe-\nrienced trader and knows all about throwbacks, so he was not worried. Prices\nthrew back to point C, above his stop (which was placed a nickel below point\nB), before rebounding.\nRobert likes using trend lines as sell signals. He drew a trend line from\npoint A to point B and extended it upward (not shown). He knew that steep\ntrends tended to be short lived, but the upward climb was not steep enough to\nworry him. He redrew the trend line (shown) as prices climbed.\nFor fun, he computed the price target and it turned out to be 5.95. Prices\nclimbed through the target, pausing around 5, a round number and a common\nsupport and resistance zone, but eventually pushed their way through.\nSince prices kept bumping against the trend line without piercing it, he\nwas not worried . . . until early June. That is when prices tumbled through the\ntrend line with meaning. Coupled with excessively high volume a few days\nearlier, it seemed time to sell. That is what he did the following day (point D).\nRobert bought at 4.90 and sold at 6.50, for a gain of 33% in about 5\nmonths. From that point, it took over a year for prices to make a new high.\n652\nScallops, Ascending and Inverted\n",

      "text": "Identification Guidelines\nTable 43.1 shows identification characteristics of descending scallops.\nPrice trend. The descending scallops I looked at appeared in a down-\nward price trend 64% of the time, or about two of every three scallops. Since\ndescending scallops work best as bearish patterns, avoid trading those in an\nupward price trend. Sometimes you will see a descending scallop form at the\ntop of a long, upward price trend. It acts as a reversal when price breaks out\ndownward. It may be worth trading; the Sample Trade explores one such trade.\nShape. Look for a reverse J shape, with the left side of the scallop higher\nthan the right. The bowl at the bottom of the pattern should appear smooth\nand rounded, not excessively rough or V shaped. Allow variations: Tall but\nnarrow scallops may look more V shaped than wider scallops and often a price\nspike will poke out downward.\nEnds. The start and end of the pattern (point A and B in Figure 43.1)\nshould be far apart in price. The usual retrace, C to B, of the A to C distance\nis 60%. In other words, price climbs 60% of the way to A from the bowl low.\nSince this figure is an average, allow variations, but the key is to avoid scallops\nthat look like rounding turns—two ends at nearly the same price.\nVolume. Most of the time, 70%, volume will be dome shaped. I never\nexclude a scallop because of the volume shape, but scallops with upward break-\nouts perform better with dome-shaped volume, and scallops with downward\nbreakouts do best with U-shaped volume.\nFigure 43.2 shows four descending scallops. You can see that the overall\nprice trend is downward. It starts on the left at about 20 and saucers down to\nabout 15. The descending scallops appear like reverse J patterns. The minor\nhigh on the right is below the left minor high and between the two peaks is a\nrounded recession. You can see that the last scallop has minor highs that are\nnearly equal. This feature often suggests the declining price trend is nearing an\nend. In this case, prices reach the ultimate low in less than 2 months at 13.63,\nquite close to the last bowl low of 14.75.\nIdentification Guidelines\n657\nTable 43.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nPrice trend\nLook for a downward price trend leading to the scallop.

In Figure 43.2 you can see the spikes in late March and mid-June.\nFocus on Failures\nDescending scallops fail most often because of two other chart patterns: sup-\nport and resistance. Figure 43.3 shows the first example. The July scallop\nbegins at A and ends at B. The bowl has a downward price spike, making the\nturn less smooth than I like to see. Volume is dome shaped, which is typical for\ndescending scallops. After B, prices move down and it looks like they will drop\nbelow the bowl low and complete a breakout. Since price is declining leading\nto the scallop, down is the expected breakout direction. However, price comes\nclose to breaking out downward, but the close remains above the bowl low.\nWhen it closes above B at C, the pattern surprises with an upward breakout.\nPrices rise to the height of A and throw back to the price at B. Overhead resis-\ntance is the culprit. Numerous valleys touch the resistance line and a solid block of\nhorizontal price movement adds strength to the zone in January to March.\nAs in most throwbacks, prices recover and attempt a new high that suc-\nceeds, but not by much. Overhead resistance is there to swat it down and prices\ndrop below the pattern low. The rise from B to the resistance zone where\nprice stalls measures 5%.\nFigure 43.4 shows the second example of a failure, this time with a down-\nward breakout.

Compute the formation height by sub-\ntracting the low near B (21.11) from the high at A (23.75), giving a height of\n2.64.

      "text": "not trade a scallop until the breakout occurs unless you have a compelling rea-\nson for doing so. Remember that the breakout direction usually follows the\nprice trend leading to the pattern. For example, if price is trending down, expect\na downward breakout. In a strong bear market, an upward breakout may falter.\nStops. Since scallops perform so poorly, use a stop to protect any profits\nyou may have and to limit losses. A good starting point for downward break-\nouts is to use point C (see Figure 43.5) as the stop point. For upward breakouts,\nuse the formation low (B) as the stop-loss point.\nPlace the stop a few cents below the low (for long trades), preferably on\nan oddball number (20.93 instead of 21, for example). Every novice investor is\ngoing to use a round number, so position your stop below them. They will be\nstopped out, and you stand a better chance of having your trade left intact.\nSometimes though, this strategy will cause a larger loss because of stop run-\nning. That is when a stop causes price to decline, which trips additional stops,\nforcing prices even lower. To avoid this pitfall, place your stop above the oth-\ners, as in 21.07 instead of 21. That position also narrows your loss (for long\ntrades). Move the stop to just above the prior minor high (downward break-\nouts) or below the prior minor low (upward breakouts) as price advances. Since\nstop running seldom occurs, I place my stop below the round number.\nTrends. Since descending scallops work best in a declining price trend,\nshort the stock only in a bear market. If you own the stock, ask yourself if you\nwant to suffer through a 20% decline.

      "text": "Sample Trade\nFigure 43.5 shows the sample trade for descending scallops. How would you\ntrade the June scallop? The first thing you may notice is that it appears at the\nend of a long upward price trend. Thus, this scallop acts as a reversal. This fact\ndoes not become clear until price closes below point B, the lowest low in the\npattern. When that happens, it signals a downward breakout and a trend\nchange. That movement means shorting the stock (or selling shares you own),\na risky maneuver that should be left to serious traders and investors.\nBefore taking a position in the stock, use the measure rule to determine\nhow far prices will decline. I already discussed this in Trading Tactics, so refer\nto the measure rule discussion there for more information.\nLook for support and resistance zones. Overhead resistance will probably\noccur at the old high (in early June at 23.75), perhaps forming a double top.\nSupport appears at 19, as shown in Figure 43.5, set up by the base of a\nright-angled and ascending broadening formation. If price pierces 19, then I\nwould consider it likely to stall at 16. Although not shown in the figure, 16 is\nthe price at which the decline stalled during the summer and fall of 2001.\nAdditional support appears as a broadening top, centered near 14 and extend-\ning as far back as 1999.\nSince the measure rule target (18.47) and support (at 19) are nearly the\nsame price, that is where I would expect price to stop. If the market were also\ntrending down during the trade, an additional decline to the next support zone\n(16) might be possible or even likely. Below that might be a dream unless com-\npany fundamentals are in serious trouble.\nWith a breakout price of 21.11 and a target of 19, is a 5% decline worth\ntrading, especially a risky short sale? I do not think so. Suppose price declines\nto 16, for a 24% loss. Now we are talking!\nIf fundamental analysis shows the market flooded with nickel, copper,\ncobalt, or precious metals, all of which Inco produces, then the oversupply\nshould translate into lower stock prices. News such as that would give me con-\nfidence to short the stock.\nAccording to Table 43.4, a gap in a bear market suggests a larger decline\nthan without a gap. Suppose you shorted the stock at the close the day after the\ngap. That would be at 20.45, well below the formation low of 21.11.\nIn the coming days, price drops. For short-term traders, consider cover-\ning the short once price nears support at 19 or the predicted target of 18.47.\nMany times, the decline will fall short of the target and it may be prudent to\ntake your profits or tighten (lower) your stop. A lower stop allows you to cap-\nture more of your profit but still give the stock room to drop farther.\nIf you put an order to cover the short at 18.47, you would have missed it\nbecause price declined to 18.52 before rebounding for a week. Patience would\nbe rewarded, though, when prices dropped through support and continued\ndown, triggering the order.\n668\nScallops, Descending\n",

For example, the height of the scallop shown in\nFigure 44.4 is the price difference between B and C. The high is at 11.55 and\nthe low is at 8.21, giving a difference of 3.34.

I consider values over 80% to be reliable, so this method\nfalls well short. Be conservative in your estimates. Is a support zone near the\ntarget? If so, price is more likely to stop there.\nAnother check of the target is to turn it into a percentage decline. In this\nexample, the predicted decline measures 41% (or 3.34/8.21). Since the scallop\npattern in Figure 44.4 is in a bear market, Table 44.3 shows that fewer than\n76% decline by at least 35% (the closest decline to 41%).

The highest high in each peak must be lower than\nthe prior peak. Allow no ties because we are not searching for double or triple\ntops. The three peaks need not follow a straight down-sloping trend line.\nProportion. The three peaks should appear similar in size and shape. Do\nnot mix a wide and tall peak with a short, one-day spike. Consider Figure 45.2.\nPeaks A1, A2, and A3 appear similar in magnitude. They are all minor highs\nand each peak has a lower top than the one before. Notice that the B peaks are\nmuch smaller in size and shape but distinguishable as three independent peaks,\nnot three peaks born from the same congestion region. Both A1 to A3 and B1\nto B3 are valid three falling peaks patterns.\nThe reason for the rule about proportion is to avoid confusion about peak\nselection. Consider peaks C and D. To me, these look like something I missed\nwith my lawnmower. They are minor highs, as are the other A peaks, but they\nare not in the same league. They are 1- or 2-day spikes that appear out of place\nwith the rounded appearing A1 peak. They are not of the same magnitude or\nproportion. When selecting the three peaks, I ignored C and D and went with\nA1, A2, and A3.\nWhy not select peak E? This peak is robust enough to join the party, so\nyou could call it the third peak. When A3 comes along, you might question the\nvalidity of the A1, A2, E pattern because A3 forms a higher high. The way I\nlooked at the pattern, I liked the idea that you could draw a trend line along the\nA1, A2, and A3 peaks. Having E as the last peak seems out of place.

She did not know that a bear market (in the\nS&P 500 index) would begin in March 2000, a month after she bought. \nNothing along the way worried her about the stock’s performance. She\nviewed the retrace in an uptrend (March and April) when the bear market\nbegan as part of the normal stair-step climb that stocks make. Prices pierced\nanother trading range in May, suggesting continued strength in the stock.\nWhen price peaked at point 1 and dropped to A on high volume, she took\nnotice. Her study of the markets suggested that large price swings on high vol-\nume often mean a trend change. When price made a third lower peak (3), she\ndrew a trend line connecting the two valleys (A and B), forming an up-sloping\ntrend line. The day after price closed below the line, she sold her holdings and\nreceived a fill at 34.27. She made 71% on the trade.\nThe stock continued dropping, reaching a low of 1.02 in early September\n2002, for a decline of 97% below where she sold the stock.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select three falling\npeaks that perform better after the break out.

In a bear market, the performance\nis about what you would expect from a countertrend breakout. Throwbacks\noccur in nearly two out of three trades. That rate is high enough that you\nshould expect one when you trade.\nTour\nWhat does a three rising valleys (3RV) chart pattern look like? Figure 46.1\nshows a good example of one. Most often, the pattern will appear in a rising\nprice trend. The one shown comes after a short-term downtrend (starting with\nthe July peak) but before that, prices climbed for almost a year.\nThe three valleys in the figure are pronounced, and their lows almost fol-\nlow a trend line upward. Three valleys tracing a straight line is not a require-\nment for this pattern but most often, that is what you will see. Your eye tends\nto line up the valleys so you will pick minor lows that seem similar to one\nanother.\nVolume in the figure shows a dome shape in the middle of the pattern and\nthat shape predominates 60% of the time, but U-shaped volume suggests bet-\nter performance.\nThe following section further discusses identification guidelines.\nTour\n699\n1\n2\n3\nElkCorp (Building Materials, NYSE, ELK)\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n36\n38\n99\nMay\nMar\nApr\nJul\nFeb\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan 00\nFigure 46.1\nThe three rising valleys chart pattern.\n",

This one occurs well\ninto the upward price trend, and there are others not shown in the figure that\noccurred earlier. Points 1, 2, and 3 mark the minor lows. Each valley is above\nthe prior one. Their shape is also similar—wide in this example, not narrow\nlike the cluster in June (point A and to the right).\nThe pattern confirms when price closes above the highest high in the pat-\ntern. In this example, prices throw back a few days after the breakout and then\ncontinue climbing until peaking in September. That peak marks the ultimate\nhigh for a rise of 34% in a bear market. Volume is dome shaped in this exam-\nple, which is also the most common shape.\nFigure 46.3 shows what a 3RV pattern looks like in a downtrend.

In the example shown in Figure 46.3, that would change a 2%, rise into\na 12% gain. That is not much, but you can make a million bucks by first sav-\ning the pennies.\nFocus on Failures\nThe three rising valleys chart pattern has a small break-even failure rate, but it\nstill fails.

The pattern confirms when price closes\nabove the highest high.\nWhy did this rising valley fail? I find it valuable to take the big picture and\nzoom in. Since the pattern begins at point 1, I would notice the measured move\ndown pattern marked by turns B and C (the first leg); the corrective phase, C to\nD; and the second down leg, D to 1. After a measured move down, the most\ncommon retrace is a climb back into the corrective phase, C to D. After that, a\nresumption of the original trend (downward in this example) is a good bet.\nSince the corrective phase is a solid block of horizontal price movement,\nit presents a formidable challenge to any price mountaineer willing to attempt\nthe climb. I would not invest in this pattern because of nearby overhead resis-\ntance and the likelihood of price dropping, resuming the downtrend.\nNote point A, the early confirmation price.

Active traders, who want to maximize the number of trades each\nyear, should concentrate on trading this pattern in a bull market.\nTable 46.3 shows failure rates for the 3RV pattern. The bull market\nnumbers are lower than the bear market ones. For example, 5% of bull mar-\nket patterns fail to rise at least 5% after the breakout. This figure triples to\n15% failing to rise at least 10%. In a bear market, over half the patterns fail to\nrise at least 20%.\nDespite what appears to be an alarming increase in failures for small price\nmoves, the numbers are quite reasonable when compared to other chart pat-\nterns.

If your cost of trading is 5% and you want\nto make 15% (20% total), how often does the 3RV pattern fail? Answer: 34%\nin a bull market and 52% in a bear market.

That is one of the reasons\nthe ascending triangle is one of my favorite formations: It can show you where\nthe right place is at the right time. You can make a bundle of money if you\ntrade it properly. But before we get to trading tactics, let us look more closely\nat ascending triangles.\nSince upward breakouts invariably perform better than downward ones,\nthe biggest surprise is that downward breakouts have smaller break-even fail-\nure rates than upward breakouts. The differences are small except for the bear\nmarket when the failure rate is 3%, one quarter the 12% rate of upward break-\nouts. Speaking of failure rates, beginning with the second edition of the Ency-\nclopedia, I count premature breakouts as the actual breakout. In the first edition,\nI ignored them. Thus, the failure rates are now higher and the average rise or\ndecline is smaller. The reason for the change is that traders do not ignore pre-\nmature breakouts because each breakout looks like the real thing. The statis-\ntics now reflect that trading reality.\nTour\nFigure 47.1 shows a good example of an ascending triangle.

A pre-\nmature breakout gives a hint of the coming action; less than 2 weeks later,\nprices break out again and move higher.\nWhy do ascending triangles form? Imagine you are the manager of a\nlarge mutual fund. Over the years your fund has purchased a few hundred\nthousand shares of the company shown in Figure 47.1. After seeing the stock\nrise for almost a year, you are getting nervous about continuing to hold it. You\nbelieve the stock is trading well above its fair market value and you have spot-\nted a more promising situation in another company.\nYou tell the trading department to dump all your shares as long as it\nreceives at least 18.50. For 2 days, starting on June 4, 1993, the trading depart-\nment sells shares. Since your fund has a large block of shares to get rid of, the\nprice cannot climb much above 18.50 without the fund selling shares and forc-\ning prices back down. The selling puts a ceiling on the stock. Word gets\naround that you are selling and other institutional investors jump on the band-\nwagon and sell too. Their aggressive selling satiates demand and the stock\nstarts declining. It tumbles to a low of 16.25 on June 9, where buying demand\nhalts the decline. Buyers, viewing the price of the stock as a steal, demand\nmore shares. The buying pressure turns the decline around and prices start ris-\ning—quickly at first but more slowly as additional investors become willing to\nsell their shares. When the stock hits 18.50 again on June 16, your fund sells\nmore shares, effectively halting the advance.

Prices rebound one last\ntime, and hit the sell zone and stay there for about a week before being turned\naway by excess supply. A call from the trading department confirms that the\nstock has been completely sold.\nWithout an overhanging supply to halt the stock’s rise, prices gap up on\nincreasing demand and soar to 19.25. Your fund is out of the picture, but the\nforces of supply and demand are not finished with the company. Others still\nselling their shares force the stock price back down into the triangle proper.\nPrices race to the other side of the triangle, rebound off the lower trend line,\nthen march back up out the top.\nIf I had to sum up the price action of an ascending triangle, I would say it\nforms because of a supply of shares available at a fixed price. Once the supply\ndepletes, shares quickly break out of the formation and move higher. If\ndemand continues to be strong, prices rise. Otherwise, the stock collapses back\non itself and either regroups for another try or continues down.\nIdentification Guidelines\nFinding an ascending triangle in a chart of daily price data is simple, perhaps too\nsimple. I read a tutorial in a popular magazine in which nearly half the illustra-\ntions purporting to be triangles were incorrectly identified. If you have any\ndoubt about the validity of a chart pattern, others may share those doubts. If\nothers do not see the same shapes you do, chances are the pattern will not work\nas you expect. Under those circumstances, where there is some doubt about cor-\nrect identification, do not trade the formation. Save your money for a trade\nwhere you are sure the formation is valid. I discuss identification problems later\nin this section. For now, Table 47.1 lists ascending triangle characteristics.\nTriangle shape. The triangle pictured in Figure 47.1 is nearly a classic\nexample of an ascending triangle. The horizontal top line of resistance repels\nprices and they rebound off a steadily rising support line below. The two nar-\nrowing lines, one horizontal and the other sloping up, outline a triangular\nshape. The ascending trend line predicts a rise in prices, hence the name\nascending triangle.\nHorizontal top line, up-sloping bottom trend line. The top horizon-\ntal trend line should have prices that approach and withdraw at least twice (in\nother words, two distinct minor highs). Similarly, two distinct minor lows sup-\nport the up-sloping trend line. The two trend lines meet at the triangle apex,\nbut prices usually break out of the formation well before then.\nCrossing pattern. Price should cross the pattern several times, not walk\nalong one of the trend lines. The pattern should look filled with price, not white\nspace. Cutting off a price turn and calling it a triangle is a common selection error.\nVolume. As the triangle forms, volume is heavy at first but tapers off until\nthe day of the breakout. Often volume is abnormally low a few days before the\n714\nTriangles, Ascending\n",

When the\nbreakout comes, volume can rise substantially and usually does, but heavy vol-\nume on a breakout is not a prerequisite.\nPremature breakouts and breakouts. How can you be sure the break-\nout is not a premature one? You cannot. A premature breakout is a close out-\nside the boundaries of the two trend lines. After a few days, prices return to the\nconfines of the triangle and eventually break out for good by soaring above the\ntop trend line. Volume on premature breakouts is indistinguishable from nor-\nmal breakouts and both occur at about the same distance to the triangle apex.\nPrice action after breakout. Once a triangle has a genuine breakout\nupward, what is the behavior like? Prices rapidly climb away from the triangle\nbut occasionally throw back to the top of the formation. Volume is usually\nheavy, supporting the rise, and continues to be heavy as momentum gathers\nspeed. Once price levels out, volume returns to normal. If price rises over sev-\neral weeks, the volume pattern usually appears erratic and heavy when com-\npared to earlier in the year.\nIdentification Guidelines\n715\nTable 47.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nTriangle shape\nTwo price trend lines, the top one horizontal and the bottom one\nsloping up, form a triangle pattern. The two lines join at the triangle\napex.\nHorizontal top line\nPrices rise up to and fall away from a horizontal resistance line at\nleast twice (two minor highs). Prices need not touch the trend line\nbut should come reasonably close (say, within $0.15). The line need\nnot be completely horizontal but usually is.\nUp-sloping bottom \nPrices decline to and rise away from an up-sloping trend line. Prices\ntrend line\nneed not touch the trend line but should come close (within $0.15).\nAt least two trend line touches (minor lows) are required.\nCrossing pattern\nThis is an important characteristic. Prices should cross the chart\npattern several times; they should not leave a vast amount of white\nspace in the center of the triangle.\nVolume\nVolume is heavier at the start of the formation than near the end.\nVolume is usually low just before the breakout.\nPremature \nSomewhat prone to premature breakouts, both up and down. \nbreakouts\nVolume on a false breakout is also heavy, just as the genuine breakout.\nBreakout\nVolume is heavy (but need not be) and continues to be heavy for\nseveral days.The breakout can be up or down, usually following the\nexisting price trend.\nPrice action after \nOnce prices pierce the horizontal resistance line confirming a break-\nbreakout\nout, prices move away from the formation. Throwbacks to the\nformation top are common. If prices continue to climb rapidly,\nvolume will probably remain high.

      "text": "What about support and resistance? If you consider the triangle as the\nmomentary intersection of two trend lines, you can guess where support and\nresistance will be. It will be along the two trend lines. Figure 47.2 shows an\nexample of this pattern on the weekly time scale. Notice the generally down-\nsloping volume trend from the formation start to the week before the breakout.\nVolume spikes upward on the breakout and then generally declines as prices\nround over and approach 1994. Prices start climbing again, essentially hugging\nthe trend line started by the ascending triangle. The upward trend continues\nfor several years following the triangle-initiated support line.

The triangle sports two minor high touches of the\ntop trend line and three on the bottom, numbered in the figure.

      "text": "Focus on Failures\nFigure 47.5 shows the first failure type: a 5% failure. Strictly speaking this is\nnot a 5% failure (because price climbs by 6%), but it is typical of what one\nlooks like. A 5% failure is when price breaks out and moves less than 5%\nhigher before curling around and moving below the formation low. In this\ncase, price leaves the formation at 6.13 and reaches a high of 6.50—a 6% move.\nMost failures of this type have two causes. The first is overhead resistance,\nand it is easy to spot. Look for peaks or valleys sharing a common price or a\nsolid block of horizontal price movement. Chart patterns, trend lines, and\nother technical patterns also set up resistance zones. Before investing in a pat-\ntern, always check for overhead resistance.\nThe second cause of failure is when the general market swings against the\nbreakout direction. If the breakout is upward and the market turns down, that\nmay be enough to kill a profitable trade. The same can happen with stocks in\nthe same industry. If competitor’s stocks are going down and yours is the lone\nholdout, chances are your stock will join the party and tank as well.

Upward breakouts act as reversals of the\ndownward price trend and downward breakouts act as continuations. The\nnumbers are close enough that one behavior does not dominate the other\n(reversals make up 53% of the triangle population and continuations 47%).\nTriangles with upward breakouts acting as trend reversals outperform, some-\ntimes significantly, and in downward breakouts, continuations outperform but\nby a slight degree.\nAverage rise or decline. The numbers in this row are, well, average\nwhen compared to other chart pattern types. The best and worst performance\ncomes during a bull market. Upward breakouts climb 35% (the best perfor-\nmance) and downward ones drop just 19% (the worst performance). Remem-\nber that I include premature breakouts as regular breakouts, so that partly\naccounts for the lower performance numbers. Note that the best performance\ncomes when prices follow the market trend: upward breakouts in bull markets\nand downward breakouts in bear markets.\nRises or declines over 45%. Upward breakouts perform well, as over a\nquarter rise more than 45%. Downward breakouts suffer using this measure, so\nthe poor showing is expected.\nChange after trend ends.

Still, it is one quarter the 12% rate of upward breakouts (103 samples).\nBest explained by examples, you read the table as follows: About a third\n(32%) of ascending triangles with upward breakouts in a bull market fail to\nclimb at least 15% after the breakout. Half (50%) fail to rise 25%. For down-\nward breakouts, the bear market does best with just 3% failing to decline at\nleast 5% after the breakout. Over half (52%) fail to drop more than 25%.\nNotice how the failure rates climb for small changes in the maximum\nprice rise or decline. The rates double or triple and then move up again, but\nnot so dramatically, for maximum price moves from 5% to 10% and on to\n15%. Such high increases are typical for all chart pattern types.\nCompare the failure rates of bull market, upward breakouts with its com-\nplement, bear market, downward breakouts.

      "text": "Trading Tactics\nNow that you can identify ascending triangles and know their behavior, how\ndo you trade them? Before I give an example of a trade, I discuss trading tac-\ntics and the measure rule (see Table 47.8).\nMeasure rule. The shape of the ascending triangle suggests prices will\nrise, but how far? If you compute the height of the formation and add the result\nto the price of the horizontal trend line, the result is the minimum predicted\nprice. This is called the measure rule. For downward breakouts, subtract the\ntriangle height from the breakout price to get the target.\nAn example makes the calculation clear for upward breakouts. Consider\nthe stock shown in Figure 47.6. Calculate the height of the formation by sub-\ntracting the low (14.38 at the first minor low) from the high (17.63 denoted by\nthe horizontal trend line) at the formation start. The difference is 3.25. Add the\nresult to the highest high—the value of the horizontal trend line—and you get\na target price of 20.88. Prices reach the target in mid-July 1992, when they\nclimb to a high of 21.63, about 6 weeks after the upward breakout.\nA more visual approach is to draw a line from the start of the formation\n(the top left corner) parallel to the up-sloping trend line. The value of the line\nthe day price breaks out of the formation becomes the target price. The figure\nshows the new line.

He is new to technical analy-\nsis and discovered ascending triangles by accident. After doing some research\nto familiarize himself with the formation, he found that if he delayed buying a\nstock until after a breakout, he would increase his chances of success. However,\nhe would also give up part of his gains because the fastest portion of the rise\noccurs at the start. That was a trade-off he was willing to make.\nDan took an interest in the company shown in Figure 47.7 when he\nnoticed an ascending triangle forming in the stock. He believed that the break-\nout was nearly at hand when volume collapsed to 23,400 shares on August 19.\nTwo days later, on higher volume, prices crossed the triangle and peaked out\nthe top. For the next few days, prices balanced themselves on the top horizon-\ntal trend line and waited for demand to send them higher. The decisive break-\nout occurred on August 26, even though volume was tepid. Dan grabbed his\ncalculator and computed the breakout distance to the apex and discovered that\nthe breakout occurred at the 70% mark. This percentage signaled a potentially\nstrong breakout.\nHowever, volume told a different story. Although volume had been\nsteadily receding throughout the formation as one would expect, there was not\nenthusiastic volume on the breakout. With this stealthy signal, Dan decided to\nwait before buying the stock.\nBelieving that a profitable opportunity was at hand, he computed the tar-\nget price to see if it afforded a profitable move.

That is when Dan pulled the trigger and bought 500\nshares at the high for the day, 19.50 (point 1 on Figure 47.7). Immediately, he\nplaced a stop-loss order to sell the stock should it decline 0.15 below the low-\nest low of the formation.

Imagine you believe the fair value of this stock is 7.38 but is\novervalued at prices much above that. You tell your broker to buy the stock\nshould it fall to 7.38. After reaching a minor high at 8.38 on October 11, the\nstock begins declining for a few days. It descends and reaches the buy price 2\ndays later. Your broker buys the stock.\nYou are not alone. Other investors, believing the stock is retesting the low\nthat occurred a week earlier, also buy the stock. Together, the buying puts a\nmomentary floor on the stock. For the next 2 days, the stock returns to the 7.38\nlevel before buying demand pushes the price higher. This time the stock does\nnot climb as high as the prior minor high; it only reaches a value of 8.13 before\nturning down. Again, when the stock reaches a low of 7.38, buying demand\nincreases enough to halt the decline at that level and to send the stock moving\nback up. During the next 2 weeks or so, you and other investors buy the stock.\nEnthusiasm for the stock quickly wanes and a series of lower highs outline a\ndown-sloping trend. The floor, at 7.38, becomes the horizontal support level.\nEventually, investors buy enough of the stock and have either run out of\nmoney to buy more or decide they already own enough. The stock slips below\nthe support line on November 9, and closes at the low for the day at 7.13. The\nstock hovers near that price for a few more days before continuing down in\nearnest on higher volume.\n732\nTriangles, Descending\nFilene’s Basement Corp (Retail (Special Lines), NASDAQ, BSMT)\nLow Volume\nBreakout\nPullback\nJan 95\nFeb\nMar\nSep 94\nOct\nNov\nDec\n – 11\n – 10\n – 9\n – 8\n – 7\n – 6\n – 5\n – 4\n – 3\n – 2\nFigure 48.1\nA nicely formed descending triangle with unusual volume pattern.\nTypically, volume trends downward and is quite low just before the breakout.

The support region at 29.50 is flat. These\ntwo ingredients, a down sloping trend line on the top and a horizontal support\nline on the bottom, are the two main characteristics of descending triangles. A\nreceding volume pattern throughout the formation completes the picture.\nThe July formation is also a descending triangle although not as well\nformed. The volume pattern rises through the first half of the formation before\nIdentification Guidelines\n733\nAvon Products Inc.

Although the second formation is a failure because it rises above the\ntriangle top, prices do start down within the month. Sometimes failed forma-\ntions prematurely alert you to a trend change, as the July example shows.\nTable 48.1 outlines the identification characteristics for descending\ntriangles.\nTriangle shape. The triangular-shaped appearance makes the descend-\ning triangle pattern easy to identify. Look for two trend lines: the bottom one\nhorizontal, or nearly so, and the top one sloping down. The two trend lines\nshould eventually join at the triangle apex, but price usually breaks out before\nreaching it.\nHorizontal support line. Price rebounds off the bottom of the forma-\ntion creating a horizontal trend line. This imaginary line acts as support for the\nstock. Once price closes below the line, it resists any upward move. Look for\nat least two touches of the horizontal trend line. The touches should be distinct\nminor lows, not part of the same consolidation region.\nDown-sloping top trend line. Prices oscillate up and down, with each\nwave getting smaller, and the tops of these waves following a down-sloping\ntrend line. The trend line acts as a layer of resistance. Look for at least two\ntouches of the top trend line, both from minor highs, not as part of the same\ncongestion region.\nVolume. Volume typically recedes over the course of triangle develop-\nment. As price approaches the breakout, it usually becomes quite low, as if\ngathering strength before a wrestling match, and then explodes upward during\n734\nTriangles, Descending\nTable 48.1\nIdentification Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nTriangle shape\nA triangular-shaped pattern bounded by two trend lines, the\nbottom one horizontal and the top one sloping down, that\nintersect at the triangle apex.\nHorizontal support \nA horizontal (or nearly so) base acts to support prices.

Prices should rise up and touch (or\ncome close to) the sloping trend line at least twice, forming two\ndistinct minor highs.\nVolume\nVolume recedes and tends to drop off just before the breakout.\nBreakouts\nUsually occur on very high volume that diminishes over time.\nHowever, prices can also break out on low volume.\nPrice action after \nPrices usually move down quickly, reaching the ultimate low in a \nbreakout\nstraight-line fashion.

Do not exclude a descending tri-\nangle just because volume looks unusual.\nBreakouts. Price can break out in any direction, including none at all\nwhen price just meanders out the triangle apex. If you were to trade descend-\ning triangles often enough, you would find that two out of three break out\ndownward. However, the breakout direction follows the prior price trend half\nthe time, meaning sometimes it acts as a reversal and sometimes not.\nPrice action after breakout. About half the time, price returns to the\nbreakout price through either a throwback (upward breakout) or pullback (down-\nward breakout), taking less than 2 weeks to complete the trip. After that, anything\ncan happen. Usually, however, price returns to moving in the original breakout\ndirection but sometimes not—just to frustrate the largest number of traders.\nSupport and resistance appear along the two trend lines. Throwbacks to\nthe top of the formation usually stop at the sloping trend line, whereas pull-\nbacks to the bottom halt at the horizontal trend line. After a breakout, prices\noften follow the sloping trend line down. During the recovery process after a\ndescending triangle, prices rise to meet the level of the horizontal trend line\nand then pause. Sometimes it takes several tries before prices push up through\nthe horizontal resistance line.\nTriangles, as a group, are easy to spot. However, there are some situations\nthat dictate a careful approach. Figure 48.3 shows an example of what looks like\nIdentification Guidelines\n735\nCrompton and Knowles Co.

In Figure 48.3 volume rises along with prices at the start\nof the triangle and then tapers off at the top when prices round over.

The climb does not end there as price forms into a pennant\nwith an upward breakout. That pennant, being a half-staff pattern, suggests a\nclimb that equals the one leading to it. In this example, the rise is more than the\npreceding one.\nWhat went wrong with this triangle? The price trend leads downward\ninto the pattern and many traders would expect a downward breakout, but the\ntriangle forms in the midst of a bull market. In a rising general market (that is,\nthe S&P 500 index is moving up), a downward breakout is always a red flag. In\nfact, the S&P was on a straight uphill run leading into August and then the\ntrend reversed. For about 2 weeks, prices declined and formed a bottom, then\na higher bottom, and then a third higher low. The three rising valleys signaled\na trend change and doomed the downward breakout from the triangle.\nBesides the market tide robbing the triangle ship of momentum, the tri-\nangle looks almost perfect. Prices touch each trend line several times, crossing\nthe triangle and leaving no white space, but volume tends to rise instead of\nrecede. The two minor lows near the start of the triangle do not rest on the\nhorizontal trend line. If you were to connect those two lows with a new hori-\nzontal trendline, the breakout would have come a bit sooner, but you still\nwould have lost money if you shorted the stock.\nIn the summer of 1995 and into the fall (not shown), several peaks appeared\nnear $13. These peaks acted as support and played a role in stopping the\ndecline. The underlying support coupled with a rising stock market truncated\nthe decline and turned a handsome descending triangle into an ugly loser.\nStatistics\nTable 48.2 shows general statistics for descending triangles.\nNumber of formations. I dug up 1,166 descending triangles; most came\nfrom 500 stocks between mid-1991 and 1996. Another 500 stocks I used from\n2000 to 2003, to encompass the bear market. The remainder of the patterns\ncame between those dates as I found them in my daily trading activities.\nReversal or continuation. If you add the numbers, you will find that the\npattern acts as a reversal 592 times and as a continuation of the prevailing price\ntrend 574 times. Thus, descending triangles are as likely to act as continuations\nas they are reversals. Do not depend on the breakout direction continuing the\ntrend leading to the pattern.\nWhen the breakout direction agrees with the market trend (bull market,\nupward breakout or bear market, downward breakout), reversals tend to per-\nform better than continuations.\nAverage rise or decline. Triangles in bull markets with upward break-\nouts are the stars, scoring a 47% rise after the breakout. Downward breakouts\nin a bear market also do well, with declines of 25%.

      "text": "Trading Tactics\nTable 48.8 shows trading tactics for descending triangles.\nMeasure rule. As you would expect, the measure rule tries to predict the\nvalue to which prices decline after a downward breakout. Compute the height\nof the formation by subtracting the price of the lower trend line from the high-\nest high in the triangle. Then, subtract the height from the value of the lower\nhorizontal trend line (downward breakouts) or add it to the breakout price\n(upward breakout). The result is the target price.\nCompute the height of the triangle shown in Figure 48.5 by taking the\ndifference between the highest high and lowest low (marked by the black dots).\nThe value is 1.44 (that is, 8.82 – 7.38). Subtract the height from the value of the\nhorizontal trend line, or 7.38 – 1.44, giving a predicted price decline to 5.94.\nPrices reach the target the day of the breakout. Since the measure rule suggests\nthe minimum price move, the final decline is often larger. In this case, the stock\nreached a low of 4.69 in mid-April 1994 for a total decline of 36%.\nAn alternative approach, which eliminates the cumbersome math, is to\ndraw a line parallel to the down-sloping trend line starting at the lower left cor-\nner of the formation. The value of the line where prices break out of the for-\nmation becomes the target price.\nWait for confirmation. Waiting for a breakout to occur is paramount\nsince the direction is unknown ahead of time.

Cover your position\nwhen prices approach the target price or until the picture changes (either fun-\ndamentally or technically).\nSell on downward breakout. Since a downward breakout can take prices\nlower rapidly, the pullback typically allows you to enter the trade at a higher\nprice than if you bought the day after a downward breakout. If the stock fails\nto pull back, look elsewhere for another opportunity. Do not chase the stock\ndown should a pullback not occur. If the stock declines and you still decide to\nshort the position, then you are probably entering near the low and setting\nyourself up for a disappointment.\nCover on measure rule. If you are long the stock and are an intermediate-\nor long-term holder and you do not want to suffer through such a decline\n(which could go much lower than the 16% to 25% average), consider selling the\nstock on the downward breakout and buying it back after it fulfills the measure\nrule. Remember, the measure rule suggests a minimum price move and yet\nprices meet the target only half of the time. In other words, if you sell the stock,\nit might not decline as far as you expect.\nSample Trade\nJacob is a novice investor. He has an MBA and works in the insurance indus-\ntry, which has acclimated him to risk. Still, shorting a stock is not his first\nchoice. The stock shown in Figure 48.6 interested him. A few days before the\nbreakout, he ran through the qualifiers. The volume trend looked good: gen-\nerally downward as you would expect until a few weeks before the breakout\nwhen it deviated from the normal pattern. The number of touches from side to\nside was good, and the minor highs and lows were distinct. He concluded that\nthis was a valid descending triangle in the making.\nJacob was nervous about shorting the stock since it could turn around and\nclimb away from him, but a stop placed at the top of the triangle would limit\nhis risk if things did not work out. Still, he was uncomfortable shorting and\nreally wanted to own the stock at a lower price. He decided to buy the stock\nafter it fulfilled the measure rule.\nHe computed the height of the triangle and discovered that the minimum\ndownward move would take the stock to 12.50. As Jacob watched the stock\neach day, he saw it break out downward and begin declining. The first time it\nreached the target price and recovered a bit, he suspected the stock was near its\nlow. At least, that is what he hoped.\nOn October 19, 1992, Jacob bought 200 shares of the stock at the close of\n12.50, exactly the target price he predicted earlier. He placed a stop-loss order\nat 11.13, slightly below the prior December’s low of 11.25, a support level.\nThen, he looked at the possible reward and believed the stock would rise to its\nold high of 17. He sat back and waited.\nSample Trade\n745\n",

In mid-\nNovember, Jacob hoped the trend was the beginning of a measured move up.\nHe calculated the difference from the low near where he bought the stock to\nthe most recent high and came up with a value of 2.63. He added this to the\ncurrent closing price and computed a new target price of 17.50. This number\nwas quite close to his original price target of 17.\nOver the next few days, the stock started moving up again. By early Decem-\nber it had hit his new price target and the measured move was complete. Jacob\ndecided to raise his stop-loss point to 16, the top of a support layer. If the stock\nsold at 16, he would have a gain of 28%, a respectable return. The results pleased\nhim so far, but he worried that prices would hit his stop as the stock consolidated.\nJust after the new year the stock started climbing again and he held on for\nthe ride. He kept raising his stop until he was taken out at 23, to which the\nstock declined in mid-February 1993.

      "text": "move up or down formation). Had the triangle broken out downward, it might\nhave continued down and fulfilled the measure rule. In such a case, the mea-\nsure from point C (on the left at 11.88) to point A should be subtracted from\nthe value of point B. The result is the target price of 6.25. Point C is the start\nof the move leading to the triangle and the measure rule applies just as in a\nmeasured move up or down formation.\nUse one or both measure rules as appropriate to the situation. The first\nmethod, using the formation height, is the more conservative of the two and\nmore likely to be fulfilled.\nTrade with trend. It is difficult or impossible to determine in which\ndirection price will break out. Generally, it continues the prevailing trend.\nEven in Figure 49.6, although the formation acts as a short-term reversal of the\ndownward trend, the longer-term trend is upward (not shown in the figure). \nWait for breakout. Always wait for a breakout. Occasionally, price\nsqueezes out the triangle apex and has no breakout at all. This is a rarity, but it\ndoes happen. Once price breaks out, trade with the trend: Go long if price\nbreaks out upward and short on downward breakouts.\nTrade busted patterns. I have noticed that even when price breaks out\nin an adverse direction (a reversal of the prevailing trend), it quickly reverses\nagain and resumes the original trend. This means, for example, in an upward\ntrend price breaks out downward and falls by 5%, then heads back up and fin-\nishes much higher. Figures 49.2 and 49.3 show examples. This behavior for\nreversals is something to watch out for, especially for downward breakouts in\na raging bull market. Trading these busted patterns can be profitable.\nIntrapattern trade. Another way of trading triangles is to buy near the\nlower trend line, sell near the upper one, and then go short. Occasionally, a\nsymmetrical triangle is tall enough and long enough that you can profitably\ntrade it in this manner, but you have to be nimble. If you are inexperienced, be\nsure to practice this on paper before trying it with real money.\nSample Trade\nCan you make money on symmetrical triangles? Yes. Consider the trade I made\nin the stock shown in Figure 49.6. There were a number of factors that led me\nto this stock, including a rising rig count, rising oil prices, cold weather, and\nrelated political events (OPEC tightening and possible oil boycott against Nige-\nria). All of these factors suggested the price of oil during the winter would con-\ntinue rising and demand for the oil field services industry would remain strong.\nAnother factor was that the stock price was riding along the bottom of a\ntrend channel. The method used to create the trend channel is somewhat com-\nplicated but it involves drawing a line using linear regression on the closing\nprices and then plotting two lines parallel to the regression line, each two stan-\n762\nTriangles, Symmetrical\n",

      "text": "The price level of the three valleys is nearly the same, in this case, within\n$0.38 of one another. That feature is a key element of triple bottoms as we see\nin the Identification Guidelines section.\nEach chart formation is unique with characteristics that distinguish it\nfrom other patterns, and the one in Figure 50.1 is no exception. The stock\nreaches a low in mid-October 1992, after trending down for 5 months. Then\nprices retrace their losses and stray into new high territory before heading\ndown to the first triple bottom low. Support reached during formation of the\nfirst low is set up by the peak back in May 1992. Prices climb to the 37 area sev-\neral times from January to May but fail to burst through the resistance.\nThe multiple hits on the ceiling are in no small measure responsible for the\nsupport the triple bottom encounters. As prices descend to 37, investors willing\nto part with their shares at the lower level are scarce. When someone does offer\nto sell, buyers snatch the stock believing they are getting a good bargain. They\nare right. Prices do not meander at the 37 level for long. If you look closely at\nFigure 50.1, each valley floor is a 1-day downward spike, albeit small but visible.\nThe start of the formation, from the first to the second bottom, looks like\na broadening top, right-angled and ascending, with its horizontal bottom and\nup-sloping top trend line. However, there are not enough price crossings to\nvalidate the formation. It always makes me nervous when I see plenty of white\nspace in a formation (such as that shown between the first and second bot-\ntoms). When the rise between the second and third troughs fails to come any-\nwhere near the up-sloping trend line, the jig is up.\nPrices stop rising at the same point, about 46, making the triple bottom\nlook like a double top. This pattern, too, fails to come to fruition when prices\nreach the 37 support zone and turn around. The double top remains uncon-\nfirmed and it just becomes another two bumps on the price chart.\nPrice eventually punches through the overhead resistance and continues\nhigher, following a near straight-line run. In this example, the triple bottom\nacts as a consolidation of the uptrend.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 50.1 outlines the guidelines for identifying triple bottoms.\nThree bottoms, price. I think most technical analysts will tell you that\nnot any three bottoms will do for a triple bottom.

When price rises above the confirmation line, the formation confirms and\nprice should continue rising.\nYou can see in Figure 50.2 that the three bottoms are at nearly the same\nprice. Only the last bottom falls short of the goal. As we see in the Statistics\nsection, this often signals a better performing formation. This triple bottom is\nthe beginning of a large, extended move that takes prices from a low of 34.50\nto a high of 73.50 in 16 months.\nThe volume trend in this formation is downward with the largest con-\ncentration of high volume on the first bottom. The center bottom has subdued\nvolume and is even lower on the third bottom in early October. Volume spikes\nupward as price rises to the confirmation point in mid-November.\nWeekly chart. Triple bottoms are usually large enough to be visible on\nweekly charts.\nFocus on Failures\nOnce price reaches the confirmation line, it usually has been rising for about a\nmonth, on average, since the third bottom. Price often pierces the resistance line\nbut doubles back, hesitating before continuing up—most of the time. In some\ncases, price rises above the confirmation point by less than 5% before throwing\nback and continuing down. When that happens, it is called a 5% failure. In this\nstudy of triple bottoms, all chart patterns must stage an upward breakout (a rise\nabove the highest high in the formation) before being labeled a triple bottom.\nSince all formations have upward breakouts, only 5% failures remain to wipe the\nwarm glow of a successful investment from a novice investor’s face. Fortunately,\n5% failures are rare. Figure 50.3 shows an example of such a failure.\nThe formation is a triple bottom since price rises above the confirmation\nline in mid-September. But the rise is brief—only 1 day has a close above the\nconfirmation line before price tumbles.\nWhat are the signs of a budding failure? In this situation, the curved rise\nleading to the triple bottom suggests a rounding top. The volume pattern is\nsuspiciously flat, but an irregular or abnormal pattern is common and should\nnot automatically disqualify a formation. Perhaps the most likely failure is not\none of performance but of identification. Are the three bottoms well separated,\neach a significant minor low in its own right? Are the low prices near to one\nanother without the center bottom being meaningfully below the other two?\nAs you look at the formation, it should take on a striking appearance and\nalmost shout, “Yes, I am a triple bottom!” There should be something familiar,\na special quality that distinguishes a valid triple bottom from any other three-\nlump configuration. If it does not scream, “Buy me!” then you should probably\nlook elsewhere.\nFocus on Failures\n769\n",

      "text": "Triple tops remind me of some mountains in New Mexico or the drumlins in\nupstate New York. A mountain or hill soars above a flat plain. They look odd\nbecause they stand alone. I love those mountains, but triple tops are another\nmatter. As bearish patterns, they predict a price downturn and that is never a\ngood omen for traders holding the stock.\nThe low failure rate in a bear market (5%) plus the average decline (24%)\nmake triple tops a solid performer. As you might guess, the performance in a\nbull market suffers.\nSurprises are many with this pattern, but I am sure you can guess what\nmost of them are. Busted patterns perform very well, so if you see a confirmed\ntriple top with price that drops less than 5%, buy it. The taste of an average\n63% rise is positively mouthwatering in such situations. Another unusual sur-\nprise is when weak volume surrounds the last peak. For some reason, that\noccurrence predicts a larger decline. Since the statistics are averages, your\nresults will vary, so be sure to use stops and prudent money management.\nTour\nFigure 51.1 shows a triple top on the daily scale. The pattern reminds me of a\nroller coaster as prices climb the first hill. Then it is over the top to glide down\nthe slope and up to the next high and over the third one as well.

Price piercing the neck-\nline seals the fate of the stock. Price tumbles in a straight-line fashion until\nreaching a low of 37, a decline from the triple top high of 50.\nThe three peaks of the triple top form at about 50 and have two valleys\nbetween them. The lowest valley low marks the confirmation point, the level to\nwhich prices must decline to confirm the validity of the formation. After con-\nfirmation, prices usually pull back to the confirmation point before stumbling.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 51.1 outlines identification guidelines for triple tops.\nThree large distinct tops. When searching for a triple top or verifying\nthat the three bumps on a price chart belong to the formation, look at the high-\nest high in each peak. The peaks should be near one another in price. A center\npeak that towers above the other two suggests the pattern is a head-and-shoul-\nders top. When the tops consistently inch upward, the activity suggests a broad-\nening top. While looking at the three peaks, do not ignore the lows. The\nformation may be a right-angled descending broadening top or even a descend-\ning broadening wedge if the three peaks are moving down slightly in price.\nIdentification Guidelines\n781\nTable 51.1\nIdentification Characteristics \nCharacteristic\nDiscussion\nThree large distinct tops\nLook for three minor highs, well separated and distinct. The\ntall peaks are often sharp spikes that contrast with more\nrounding-appearing valleys.\nSame price\nThe price variation among the three tops is minor. The\ncenter top should not be significantly above the other two,\notherwise it is a head-and-shoulders top. There is a\ntendency for smaller triple tops to be one of the\nbroadening family of chart patterns, especially the right-\nangle variety, so pay attention to the price lows, too.\nDownward volume \nThe volume trend is usually downward but may be hard to \ntrend\nread. Often the volume pattern is flat except near each of\nthe three peaks. The first peak often has the highest volume.\nConfirmation point\nPrices must decline below the lowest low in the formation\n(the confirmation point) or it is not a triple top. An up-\nsloping trend line drawn connecting the valley lows can\nalso serve as confirmation. \nWeekly chart\nSince triple tops are usually large price formations, look at\nthe weekly chart to help identify the longer variety.\n",

      "text": "In the case of a right-angled broadening top, you can probably make money\non the triple top formation even before the broadening top breaks out. At least\nwith a broadening formation, you can anticipate when it will be time to close out\nyour position (do so when prices approach the lower, down-sloping, trend line).\nSame price. The three peaks in a triple top usually are sharp and pointed\nlooking, with rounded-appearing valleys in between. There are wide varia-\ntions in this pattern, so do not be too critical. Make sure the three well-sepa-\nrated peaks are not part of the same congestion pattern. Each top should be a\npart of its own minor high, a distinct peak that towers above the surrounding\nprice landscape. The price difference between the three peaks is usually minor,\nwith the center peak often below the other two. A large price variation should\nexclude the pattern from consideration.\nDownward volume trend. The overall volume trend is usually down-\nward and lackluster, but varies from formation to formation. Volume on the\nthree peaks, especially the first one, is higher than in the valleys.\nConfirmation point. The three-bump pattern confirms as a triple top\nwhen price closes below the lowest low in the pattern. Without confirmation,\nyou do not have a triple top and price is likely to continue rising. Alternatively,\nan up-sloping trend line drawn across the bottoms of the two valleys can also\nserve as confirmation. Often, this approach will allow you to enter a trade sooner.\nTo see what a triple top looks like, examine Figure 51.2. The three peaks\nare pointed, well separated, and distinct. The three minor highs are obvious\nand that is important in any formation. If other investors do not recognize a\nchart pattern for what it is, they will not try to take advantage of it. If they do\nnot buy or sell appropriately, the pattern will fail. Chart patterns are a self-\nfulfilling prophecy that depend on the crowd behaving the same way.\nAll three peaks are at about the same price level with the center peak a bit\nrecessed from the other two. This feature is common as quite a number (25%)\nof triple tops have a lower center peak.\nThe receding volume trend is clear in the figure with the first peak wit-\nnessing the highest volume of the three.\nAn interesting development in this formation is a trend line drawn below\nthe lows (not shown but it connects points A and B on the chart). With another\ntrend line drawn horizontally across the three tops, the formation takes on the\nappearance of a right-angled descending broadening top. In many triple tops, the\nbroadening formation also appears. This occurrence does not diminish the valid-\nity of the triple top; it just makes both formations easier to trade (because you can\nbuy or sell at the trend lines and take advantage of partial rises or declines).\nWeekly chart. The larger triple tops appear on the weekly scale, and Fig-\nure 51.3 shows an example. Even though the average triple top sports a 19% to\n24% decline, price occasionally falls much farther. As you can see in the chart,\nthe triple top marks the peak in the stock. From the high of 32.94, the stock\nplummets to 4.75, a stomach-churning decline of 86% in 2 years.\n782\nTriple Tops\n",

This\nis a key point. Prices must decline to the confirmation point, the lowest low\nreached in the formation. If prices do not decline to that level, then the three-\nbump formation is not a triple top—it is just a collection of minor highs (or, per-\nhaps, some other formation).\nFigure 51.4 shows a typical example of a 5% failure. The three tops are dis-\ntinct minor highs that form after a 2-month spurt upward.

The lowest low is just a smidgen below the confirmation point,\nwhich validates the formation, before prices begin climbing again.\nHad you sold this stock short at the confirmation point of 20.25, you\nshould have covered your trade once prices climbed above the highest high in\nthe formation, in this case, 23.88. This tactic would have kept losses to a rather\nlarge 18%, but that is certainly better than hoping for a decline while watch-\ning it rise to 33!\nSometimes, it is difficult to determine exactly why a stock fails to perform\nas expected.

In late January, the Federal Reserve cut two key interest rates by\n0.25% giving hope that the health of the overall economy would improve.\nOn the technical front, if you draw trend lines along the three tops and\nthe minor lows, the formation takes on the appearance of a descending broad-\nening wedge since the three tops are at consecutively lower prices. With the\nwedge, it is difficult to predict in which direction the breakout will occur. The\nfundamentals suggest the breakout will be upward, and that is exactly what\nhappens.

However, I found almost 100\nthat formed as a congestion area in a falling price trend. Those I call continu-\nations because price continues lower after the breakout.\nThe performance difference between continuations and reversals is slight,\n25% versus 23% in a bear market. A bull market shows no performance dif-\nference. Still, if you see a triple top forming in a downtrend, that will be the\none to consider shorting.\nAverage decline.

If you find a triple top in which price\ndrops less than 5% before shooting upward, buy it. Chances are the rise is\ngoing to be an exceptional one.

If you compare the average decline\n(19%, 24%) with the market change from the breakout to the ultimate low\n(1%, –15%), you can see the market influence on triple top performance. A\nbear market helps stocks decline. This finding suggests that you short a stock\nin a bear market or sell a long holding before the cleaners find you.\nDays to ultimate low. In a bull market, it takes about 2 months to reach\nthe ultimate low and about 1.5 months in a bear market. Comparing the aver-\nage decline in both markets, the slope of the decline must be steeper in a bear\nmarket than in a bull one. This finding emphasizes the need for stops. Without\na stop, if you are not careful, your loss can grow to huge proportions quickly.\nTable 51.3 shows failure rates for triple tops. Clearly, the bear market\nnumbers are lower than the bull market ones. For example, 5% of the triple\ntops I looked at in a bear market failed to decline at least 5%. Almost half,\n46%, failed to drop at least 20%. In a bull market, the result is even worse with\n63% failing to drop at least 20%.\nThe table suggests you trade this pattern in a bear market. That is the\ntime to consider shorting a stock. If you own a stock, and a confirmed triple top\nappears, sell it.

In a bear market,\nthe worst performance comes from the same range.\nPullbacks. Pullbacks occur in almost two out of three patterns, and price\ntakes about 11 days to return to the breakout price. When a pullback occurs,\nperformance suffers. For example, in a bull market prices decline 18% after\nthe breakout when a pullback is present. Without a pullback, the decline mea-\nsures 21%.\nGaps. Gaps that occur on the breakout day tend to send prices down far-\nther than breakouts without gaps. Look at the gap size: $0.85 in a bull market\nand double that, $1.76, in a bear market. That is huge! The bad news is that\nyou must have a position in the stock before the gap in order to participate fully\nin the decline.\nTable 51.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate low.\nThe first week sees the most triple tops bottom out, about 25%. In a bear mar-\nket, half will reach the ultimate low by week 3. Thus, if you short a stock show-\ning a triple top, expect a quick but sharp decline. At the other end of the table,\nalmost a third (29%) of the triple tops in a bull market are still searching for the\nultimate low after 2.5 months.\nNotice the slight rise during week 7 (49 days) in a bull market. Eight per-\ncent of the patterns reach the ultimate low then, about double the surrounding\nweeks. If you see price showing signs of turning up 1.5 months into the trade,\nthen close out your short position.\nTable 51.6 shows size statistics.\nHeight.

      "text": "of 12.12 (that is, 17.75–5.63). The figure shows price reaching the target in\nmid-June.\nTo better gauge the veracity of the result, you might look at the predicted\ndecline in percentage terms. From the confirmation point (the lowest low) of\n17.75, a 5.63 point decline is a loss of 32%. Table 51.3 indicates that less than\n18% of the formations have losses over 30%. Those are terrible odds.\nIn such a situation, and in most cases, you should look at support levels.\nPrices indicate support when they decline to a level and then rebound. For\nexample, the stock paused at $16 during July and August 1991 (not shown in\nFigure 51.5). This pause created the support level where the stock again paused\nduring April. Eventually, the stock worked through the support and tumbled to\na lower support level.\nWait for confirmation. In a roaring bull market, triple tops are often\ndeceiving. Three price bumps appear and price does not decline to the confir-\nmation point before soaring. Thus, an important guideline in using triple tops\nis to wait for prices to close below the confirmation point.\nTrade the trend line. Draw the trend line connecting the two valleys. If\nthis trend line slopes upward, a trade signals when price closes below it. This\nmethod will often get you in sooner than waiting for price to close below the\nlowest low.\nWait for pullback. Pullbacks occur over 60% of the time, so if you miss\nthe original breakout, you can often place your trade during the pullback. Fig-\nure 51.5 shows a quick pullback occurring just 2 days after the breakout (I\ndefine a breakout as being when price closes below the confirmation point).\nJust over a month later, investors have other opportunities (because price rises\nto the breakout point) to add to their position before the decline really begins.\nStop loss. Should the trade go against you, place a stop-loss order $0.10\nabove the nearest high. Since the three tops establish a resistance zone, prices\nwill not hit the stop order until the resistance burns through. Sometimes a\nfourth peak will appear before prices move down.\nSample Trade\nDanielle is in charge of the family finances. To boost the return on their sav-\nings, she has taken to playing the stock market. Her first few trades were ten-\ntative but profitable. That gave her enough courage to undertake the trade\nfeatured in Figure 51.5.\nShe is a brilliant, anxious, high-energy person who is comfortable taking\nmore risks than most people, so it came as no surprise when she jumped the\ngun and sold the stock short in early January. She wanted to maximize her\ngains and once prices were clearly heading down, she placed the trade and\nreceived a fill at 21.50.\n792\nTriple Tops\n",

It\nwas a good call as prices flipped around and headed back down. Seven days\nlater they reached the confirmation point of 17.75 but stalled.\nTo Danielle, it looked as though the triple top became a multiple top and\nlater developed into an unconfirmed double bottom. Each day as prices\nclimbed and her gains dwindled, she became more nervous holding onto her\nshort position.\nEventually, fear overcame greed and she covered her position at 22.25,\nsuffering a minor loss of less than a point. A week or so after she bailed out, the\nstock was lower and it kept moving down. Eventually, the stock bottomed out\nat 9.38, comfortably below the predicted price and well below her entry point\nat 21.50.\nDanielle made two mistakes with this trade. First she did not wait for\nprice to close below the confirmation point. Had she waited, she would have\nseen the false double bottom (it never confirmed as a true double bottom\nbecause price did not close above the highest high between the two bottoms).\nFurthermore, she was not patient enough for the trade to work out.\nWhen a trade goes against you, most times it is wise to quickly close out a posi-\ntion, especially if it is a short sale where losses can be unlimited. However,\nthere are times, such as this trade, where a bit of patience is necessary along\nwith a properly placed stop. Since the three peaks represent a resistance zone,\nit is wise to place a stop just above the highest high and then wait for price to\nhit it. Had Danielle waited, the trade would have worked out better than her\nanalysis predicted.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select triple tops that per-\nform better after the breakout.

When\ncompared to other chart patterns, the failure rate is a bit high except for down-\nward breakouts in a bear market. The average rise or decline is also unexciting.\nCoupled with their rare appearance and the difficulty in spotting these patterns\nin the bush, falling wedges are beasts you probably will not want to trade. Still,\nthey can come in as handy as metric wrenches.\nConcerning surprises, the lineup shows the typical suspects. I found an\nunusually high number of wedges with a random volume shape. They tended\nto perform well when the breakout was upward. Busted patterns also per-\nformed well, but the sample size was small, leading me to question the results.\nFinally, I did a frequency distribution of the breakout distance to the wedge\napex and found that the best performers in a bull market had upward breakouts\n55% to 80% of the way to the apex, with rises averaging 37%. Remember that\neven though a falling wedge may have a breakout 60% of the way to the apex,\nthat does not mean you will see a 37% rise. Since we are dealing with probabil-\nities, anything can happen, but the statistics suggest a more powerful move.\nThe percentage meeting the price target (that is, the measure rule) for\nupward breakouts uses the highest high in the wedge for the target—an easy\nobjective. For downward breakouts, I use the formation height subtracted from\nthe breakout price. That method is why downward breakouts rarely hit their\ntargets but upward breakouts do better.\nTour\nFigure 52.1 shows a falling wedge. Prices tagged a new low in late July and\nbounced upward.

When drawn on the chart, the picture looks like a\nwedge tilted downward.\nOnce prices break out upward, they rise and quickly climb above the top\nof the formation. Many times prices continue moving up.\nIdentification Guidelines\nTable 52.1 shows identification guidelines, of which there are few.\nTwo down-sloping trend lines. As mentioned before, two trend lines\noutline the price action. Both trend lines slope downward, with the top trend\nline having a steeper slope than the bottom one. Eventually, the two trend lines\nintersect at the wedge apex. You can see this in the wedge pictured in Figure\n52.2. This wedge forms as part of a consolidation pattern in an uptrend. Prices\noscillate from one trend line to the other several times before breaking out of\nthe narrowing price pattern in mid-June.\nMultiple touches. I usually regard five touches as the minimum neces-\nsary to safeguard a good formation. The reason for the multiple touches is that\nthe price pattern creates several minor highs and minor lows, each succeeding\none narrower than the last.

The for-\nmations in this study, for example, have durations from 3 weeks to 1 year.\nDurations shorter than 3 weeks are probably pennants.\nVolume trend. The volume trend should be downward. This is not an\ninviolate rule; it is only a guideline that usually rings true. For this study, 7 out\nof every 10 formations show a downward volume pattern.\nOnce price pierces the upper trendline, it continues higher. Figure 52.2\nshows price staging a breakout in mid-June and reaching the ultimate high in\nearly October. The rise, at 17% from the breakout, is well below the average rise.\nWhy do falling wedges act as they do? About half of the formations act as\nconsolidations of the prevailing trend. Like the wedge shown in Figure 52.2,\nprices are heading upward when they run into turbulence. Investors pause from\ntheir buying spree and sit on the sidelines. Price retraces its rise by creating the\nwedge, oscillating in ever-narrowing spirals, until the buying enthusiasm\nresumes. Volume shows this lack of enthusiasm as it recedes. When buying\nmomentum resumes, price and volume shoot upward again after the breakout.\nThink of a falling wedge not as a pattern of weakness, but one of strength,\na spring winding tighter and tighter. As a spring tightens, it shrinks, and so do\nprice and volume in the falling wedge. During a breakout, the pent-up force\nreleases, and price bursts through the formation boundary and zooms upward.\nFocus on Failures\nLike many formations, falling wedges suffer from 5% failures (see Figure 52.3).\nThe falling wedge acts as a reversal of the upward trend. Although not shown\non the chart, price began rising in early December 1994. During creation of\nthe chart pattern, price moved lower in a narrowing channel. After the break-\nout, price climbed and reach a high of 45.38, less than 5% above the breakout\nprice of 43.25. From the high, price headed down and reached the ultimate low\nin late October at a price of 36.38. The inability of price to continue rising\nmore than 5% after the breakout constituted a 5% failure.\nThe causes of 5% failures can be many. Overhead resistance, as in this case,\nblocked the upward rise, so be sure to check for resistance before trading. For\ndownward breakouts, look for nearby underlying support that may halt a decline.\nOther causes may include a sharp drop in the stock market—that can\nkeep an industry down for months (think of airline stocks after the tragedy of\nSeptember 11, 2001). Certainly, a switch from a bull market to a bear market\nwill tend to keep high-flying stocks cruising at a lower altitude, but even a short\ndecline in the market can cause havoc.\nRising commodity prices affect the stock market, too.

      "text": "Days to ultimate high or low. The rise in a bull market is slower than\nthe decline in a bear market. You can see this feature by comparing the bear\nmarket numbers. Upward breakouts take 77 days to rise 26%, but bear markets\ntake 32 days—less than half as long—to drop almost as far, 24%. Thus, bear\nmarkets are steeper and reach the ultimate low quicker than bull markets climb\nto the ultimate high.\nTable 52.3 shows failure rates for falling wedges. The best performance\ncomes from wedges in a bear market with downward breakouts. They have the\nlowest failure rates but only for small moves. Once price moves over 15%, then\nwedges in the bull market (both breakout directions) outperform.\nFor example, 50% of the wedges with downward breakouts in a bear mar-\nket will drop less than 20%, but 44% of the wedges with upward breakouts in\na bull market will fail to rise at least 20%. Thus, if you expect a large move,\ntrade wedges in a bull market with upward breakouts because they have lower\nfailure rates.\nHere is another way to use Table 52.3. Suppose you find a falling wedge\nthat peaks at 15 and spirals down to 10, where price breaks out upward in a bull\nmarket. Since the measure rule says to expect a climb back up to the top of the\nwedge, what are the chances of that happening? A move from 10 to 15 is 50%,\nand the table shows that 71% fail to climb that far.

Wedges with upward breakouts in a bear market do better with-\nout gaps. A contradiction? Many analysts will tell you that gaps improve per-\nformance, but I have found mixed results like those just cited.\nThe gap size, in the majority of chart patterns, is larger for downward\nbreakouts than upward ones. Why this is the case is unknown, but you should\nfactor that information into your short trade. While it is better to short a stock\nbefore the gap, can you still make money shorting after a gap occurs or does\nthe gap represent a large portion of the decline? My personal opinion is that\nshorting a stock does not yield large gains most of the time, and having a gap\nchew up some of it even before you trade suggests a more risky approach.\nApex distance. Where the breakout occurs is nearly the same across the\ntable: 56% to 59% of the way to the apex. As I mentioned earlier, the most\npowerful upward breakouts in a bull market (only) occur between 55% and\n80% of the way to the apex. Those falling within that range have rises that\naverage 37%. I did not measure the other variations of market conditions and\nbreakout directions because they rarely occur.\nTable 52.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or\nlow. Notice how quickly prices reach the ultimate high or low. In 2 weeks, over\nhalf the wedges with downward breakouts have bottomed. In 3 weeks, 65% of\nthose in a bear market have hit the ultimate low. At the other end of the scale,\nbetween a quarter and a third of the wedges with upward breakouts are still\nlooking for the ultimate high after 2.5 months.\nThese findings suggest two things. First, be prepared to take profits\nquickly if you short a wedge with a downward breakout. Second, be patient\nwith wedges with upward breakouts. You still need to be careful, but give price\nroom to move up in the usual rise, retrace fashion.\n804\nWedges, Falling\nTable 52.5\nFrequency Distribution of Days to Ultimate High or Low\nDays:\n7\n14\n21\n28\n35\n42\n49\n56\n63\n70\n>70\nBear market, \nup breakout \n30%\n7%\n4%\n3%\n6%\n6%\n7%\n2%\n5%\n1%\n29%\nBull market, \nup breakout\n20%\n9%\n7%\n7%\n4%\n3%\n3%\n4%\n4%\n2%\n36%\nBear market, \ndown \nbreakout\n32%\n19%\n14%\n5%\n5%\n4%\n1%\n0%\n4%\n3%\n13%\nBull market, \ndown \nbreakout \n44%\n11%\n4%\n5%\n6%\n4%\n1%\n1%\n1%\n1%\n20%\n",

But Clint has had some success because of the breadth of his offerings\nand some skilled marketing ploys.\nWhen Clint is not worrying about his business or pitching his wares to a\nprospective customer, he plays the stock market hoping to make enough extra\nincome to someday buy out his closest competitor. He added multimedia to his\ndemo and that is what alerted him to the company shown in Figure 52.5.\nClint watched the stock stumble and then saw the falling wedge form. He\nhoped that the new chart pattern marked the limit of the downward move and\nthat he could buy in at a good price with a mouthwatering chance of prices ris-\ning to the old high.\nWhen the stock punched through the bottom wedge trend line, he waited\nto see what price would do next. It curled around and made a mini head-and-\nshoulders bottom. He penciled in a neckline joining the rises between the two\nshoulders, following the slope of the lower wedge trend line.\nOnce price pushed above the neckline and above the wedge apex, he\nplaced an order with his broker and received a fill at 30. Clint’s timing was\nexcellent. Two days after he bought, prices were already in the mid-thirties and\nclimbing. He saw prices go horizontal in mid-February through March and\nwondered if this were the corrective phase of a measured move up formation.\nThat is the way he decided to play it.\nThe base of the measured move was at the head, 27.75, and the top of the\ncorrective phase was at 38.50. The height was the difference between the two\nor 10.75. Projecting the height upward from the corrective phase bottom of\n33.50 gave him a target of 44.25. He phoned his broker and placed a limit\norder to sell his holdings at that price.\nIn mid-April the stock left the corrective phase and started climbing again\non the second leg up.

I pulled up the chart and, sure enough, the\nwedge was as plain as day and almost a year long. In my daily review of stock\ncharts, I missed finding this one. That is the major problem with wedges,\nwhether rising or falling. You cannot find them. Not only are they rare, but\nalso their spiraling price action seems hidden in a historical price series. A few\nstand out and shout “rising wedge,” like the ones shown in the figures accom-\npanying this chapter, but most remain hidden like a raindrop joining a pond.\nThe Results Snapshot gives you the bad news. Rising wedges are lousy\nperformers. In all market conditions and breakout directions, the average rise\nor decline is below the average for all other chart patterns. The failure rates,\nmost of which are double digits, are higher than I like to see and one even goes\nabove the 20% maximum I allow for well-performing patterns.\nAre there no redeeming qualities? Busted patterns perform well, beating\nthe average rise or decline posted by all rising wedges. So, if you see price nip-\nping outside of the wedge trend line that then returns and makes a breakout in\nthe opposite direction, it might be worth a closer look.\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about rising wedges is that the usual\nsurprises do not apply. For example, tall patterns perform better than short\nones, but that is only true for downward breakouts from wedges. Throwbacks\nand pullbacks usually hurt performance, but that is only true for wedge pull-\nbacks (downward breakouts).\nTour\nFigure 53.1 shows an example of a rising wedge.

Prices make\nnew minor highs and minor lows as they bounce from trend line to trend line.\nIt takes over 3 weeks for the formation to take on the wedge appearance. For-\nmations shorter than 3 weeks are pennants. However, rising wedges do not last\nlong. Typically, the apex—where the two trend lines meet—marks the end of\nthe formation. Prices usually break out about half to two-thirds of the way to\nthe apex. Rising wedges rarely last more than three months (just 21 patterns, or\n3%, are longer than 3 months).\nVolume trend. The receding volume pattern is another key element in\ncorrectly identifying a rising wedge. Most of the time, volume trends down-\nward and becomes especially low just before the breakout. However, this is not\nan absolute rule. If you suspect a wedge but it has a rising volume trend, then\nignore the volume trend.

After the breakout, prices resume falling.\nFocus on Failures\nWith poor measure rule performance and a small average rise or decline, it\nshould come as little surprise that rising wedges have higher failure rates than\nother formations. Consider Figure 53.3, a 5% failure in a rising wedge. Prices\nthat drop by less than 5% before moving higher I call 5% failures.\nYou can see in Figure 53.3 the chart pattern forms after a downward price\nmove of nearly 2 months’ duration. The wedge appears to be a retrace in a\ndownward price trend. The formation is part of the second up-leg in a mea-\nsured move up chart pattern. Not shown is the first up-leg but the decline\nbetween the two up-legs begins in late September, and a portion of it shows in\nthe figure.\nThus, one might have reason to suspect that this formation might not\nwork out as expected. Prices move up, touch the top trend line, and then\nbounce to the other side. Prices cross from side to side as they rise and form a\nnarrowing price channel.\nPrices drop out of the pattern 68% of the way to the apex, about where\nyou would expect them to. Volume is unusual as it is trending upward, but\nbegins receding the week before the breakout. It is exceptionally low just\nbefore the downward breakout.\nOnce price closes below the lower trend line, investors usually sell, help-\ning drive prices down. However, volume is low on this breakout. Price need\nFocus on Failures\n815\n",

For example, in\na bear market, wedges with pullbacks declined 14%. Without pullbacks, the\ndecline measured 29%.\nGaps.

Thus, if\nyou want to take advantage of a possible gap, you must enter the trade before\nthe breakout. Entering then will increase your risk, as you cannot accurately\npredict the breakout direction. For reference, 44% of the time the breakout is\nin the same direction as the trend leading to the wedge. That finding means if\nprice is rising into the wedge, chances are it will breakout downward. If price\nis declining into the wedge, chances are it will breakout upward.\nApex distance.

In just\nunder a quarter of the cases, prices bounce high enough to close the event day\ngap.

Viewed another way, half a year after the mas-\nsive event decline, prices had not fully recovered in almost half the stocks\nshowing a DCB.\nBounce. The bounce height, as measured from the trend low after the\nevent to the highest high in the bounce, averaged 28% in a bull market and\n35% in a bear market. This finding surprises me.

Postbounce is the decline\nmeasured from the highest high in the bounce to the postbounce low—the\nlowest low before the postbounce changes.\nPostbounce.

This criterion measures the decline if\nyou decided to ride out a DCB. The event low is the lowest low before price\nbegins its rise to the bounce high.

Use whatever method you normally use to spot the trend change. These\nmethods may include indicators such as moving averages, stochastics, RSI,\nCCI, trend lines, chart patterns, support and resistance, and so on.\nCount on the stock dropping to at least the event low (see Table 54.5).\nNot all stocks will do that, but that is the way to bet. If the drop to that price\nis not mouthwatering, then look elsewhere for a more promising trade unless\nyou have a strong reason for believing the stock will tumble. It may not. Use\nstops to protect your position.\nCheck the fundamentals and understand why the stock took a tumble in\nthe first place (the event decline). This knowledge will often give you a clue as\nto future DCBs. Many times, the problem cannot be fixed in the current quar-\nter, so additional quarters may suffer as well.\n842\nDead-Cat Bounce\nCerner Corporation (Healthcare Information, NASDAQ, CERN)\n – 24\n – 23\n – 22\n – 21\n – 20\n – 19\n – 18\n– 17\n – 16\n – 15\n – 14\n – 13\n – 12\n – 11\n – 10\nJun 96\nJul\nAug\nSep\nNegative Earnings \nPreannouncement Sent \nStock Tumbling\nDown Trend Line\nStock Sold Short\nEarnings Released\nA Smaller Dead-Cat Bounce\nPosition Closed Out\nFigure 54.5\nA negative earnings announcement triggers a dead-cat bounce.

      "text": "Sample Trade\nConsider Figure 54.5, a dead-cat bounce in Cerner Corporation. The stock\ndropped five points (25%) after the company said earnings would fall short of\nexpectations and the outlook for the remainder of the year was grim. The stock\nclosed higher on each of the next 4 days and then closed lower. Jill, after see-\ning the stock climb the hill, sold the stock short and received a fill at the clos-\ning price of 15. She then waited, watching the stock closely. It continued\nmoving down—as predicted.\nThe earnings announcement forced the stock down another 20% in 2\ndays. Expecting another dead-cat bounce, Jill held onto her position. The stock\nrose in an uneven fashion over the next week or so, and then rounded over and\nheaded lower.\nShe connected the tops from the preannouncement day onward in a\ndown-sloping trend line. When price eventually closed above the trend line,\nshe knew it was time to close out the position. The next day she bought the\nstock back and received a fill at 12, 0.25 below the daily close. She sat back and\ntotaled up her profits and realized she made almost $3 a share, or about 20%\nin just 1 month.\nAs good as the trade was, had she waited until November to close out the\nposition, she would have made an additional $1.50 a share (the stock reached a\nlow of 10.50). However, between the time of covering the short and the ulti-\nmate low, the stock climbed back to 17.25. The moral is, you never go broke\ntaking a profit.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations to help select DCBs that perform\nbetter after the breakout. Consult the associated table for more information.\n• Review the identification guidelines for correct selection—Table 54.1.\n• Nearly half the stocks make a lower low the day after the event—Table\n54.3.\n• A quarter of the stocks with event day gaps close during the bounce—\nTable 54.4.\n• The larger the event day decline, the higher the bounce but the slower\nthe rise—Table 54.4.\n• Prices decline faster and steeper in a bear market—Table 54.5.\n• Between 67% and 75% of stocks showing a DCB will drop below the\nevent low after the bounce completes—Table 54.5.\n• Between 38% and 61% of the stocks exhibiting a DCB will suffer\nanother 15% or larger decline in less than 6 months—Table 54.5.\nFor Best Performance\n843\n",

      "text": "844\n55\nDead-Cat Bounce, \nInverted\nI call this event pattern an inverted dead-cat bounce, or iDCB, because of the\nway prices move after a surprisingly good event. I did not break out the statis-\ntics in the usual tables because I used a computer to find matches in the stocks\nI track. With more than 30,000 samples in some cases, reviewing them all would\nbe too cumbersome. Thus, the format of this chapter differs from the others.\nTour\nWhat does an iDCB pattern look like? Figure 55.1 shows the first example,\ntaken from a trade I made. The inverted dead-cat bounce pattern begins with\na large, 1-day upward price move. In this example, the stock jumped 15% after\nthe earnings announcement, gapping upward on high volume. The following\nday, it made a higher high, low, and close, but over the coming days, price\ndropped, returning to the launch point and then sinking moderately below it.\nHere is my notebook entry for the trade: “2/6/04. I bought 400 shares,\n300 filled at 30.30, 100 filled at 30.39. This is an earnings flag trade. I waited\nfor a retrace before buying because of a weak general market. Price may retrace\nfarther, but I expect a renewed climb. Downside is 50% retrace to 27.50–28.\nThat is also the site of the August–November 2003 peaks. Expect a rise to 35.\nThis could stall at 34 according to the point and figure chart. At 35, this goes\nup against a long-term down trend line from the March and July peaks in\n2000. According to the 1-2-3 trend change rule, the stock is poised to move up.\nPrice pierced the down trend line, retested the low, and is now breaking out to\nnew highs.”\n",

      "text": "Let me explain the entry. This was supposed to be an earnings flag trade,\nbut as you can see, the flag was a failure because price dropped instead of mov-\ning to new highs. Had I studied the iDCB at the time, I would not have traded\nthis one. Why? Large down moves often follow large up moves.\nSince the odds of a successful trade improve with a rising stock, industry, and\ngeneral market, I waited for the market to get on board. The S&P 500 index\nstarted moving up a few days before I bought. A retrace to the 27.50–28 area\nwould find support from prior peaks but would also fill the gap. A gap usually sup-\nports the stock—as it did in late February—but price tunneled through in March.\nThe 35-price target comes from the earnings flag projection. From the\nlow the day before the large up move, price bottomed at 25.24 and then peaked\nat 31.88 for a height of 6.64. From the flag low at point A, 28.75, the target\nwould be 35.39. I played it conservative and rounded it down to 35.\nA 50% retrace of the up move in the flagpole would put the stock at 28.56,\njust above the high end of the gap, and just below point A. I find that Fibonacci\nretracement numbers (such as 38%, 50%, and 62%) come in handy to help\ndetermine support and resistance zones. You can see that price approached the\n50% retrace mark as it made a low at point A and then moved higher.\nSometimes I check the point and figure (PF) chart to help determine\nwhere support and resistance zones are. The PF chart shows overhead resis-\ntance at 34, and on the price chart, a solid block appears at that price in March\nand April of 2002 (not shown in Figure 55.1).\nTour\n845\nA\nA\nGood Earnings\nBought\nSold\nInset\nCoherent (Precision Instrument, NASDAQ, COHR)\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n28\n29\n27\n30\n31\n32\n33\n03\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nFeb\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan 04\nFigure 55.1\nGood earnings propel the stock upward by 15%.

      "text": "The 1-2-3 trend change rule is beyond the scope of this book (see Trad-\ning Classic Chart Patterns, Wiley, 2002, for an explanation), but it says price has\nchanged trend from down to up when it breaks a down-sloping trend line,\nretests the low but fails, and rises above a prior minor high. Those three crite-\nria were satisfied when price gapped above a down-sloping trend line connect-\ning the September and October peaks, as shown.\nHere is my notebook entry for the sale: “2/12/04. The Dow was up 123\npoints yesterday, but this stock hardly moved. Today, it has broken out down-\nward from a pennant. Time to cut the loss. I’ll sell at the market open tomor-\nrow. This stock did not do as I expected, so it’s time to sell. 2/13/04. The stock\nsold at 29.255.”\nSince my trading success depends on the market helping push prices\nupward, when the stock fails to participate in a market rally, that is often a red\nflag. Coupled with the breakout from the pennant (see inset in Figure 55.1),\nthat signaled a sell. One key rule with trading chart or event patterns is that if\nprice does not do as you expect, then close out your position. I did just that and\ncut my loss to about $450, or 3.8%. If I held on, I could have ridden it down to\nthe May low for a 20% loss.\nStatistics\nFor this pattern, instead of showing large tables of numbers, I show graphs. Let\nme issue this warning up front. The following graphs show averages of thou-\nsands of samples. Your trade will probably not act like the profile. Still, all of\nthe graphs suggest selling on day 2, when price makes a higher high. Whether\nyou buy back in later depends on the situation and price action. Use common\nsense and your trading experience to execute correctly.\nThe first graph, Figure 55.2, shows the price profile of between 29,600\nand 37,100 event patterns in which the high, low, or closing price moved more\nthan 5%. I used about 250 stocks to collect the data from as early as January\n1988 to June 2004. Not all stocks had data covering that period.\nThe figure is a frequency distribution of the average price change over\ntime. The vertical axis shows the average climb as measured from low to low,\nhigh to high, or close to close between the day before the large move (called\nthe reference day) to succeeding days up to a month later. For example, on day\n1, the intraday low and closing prices were 7.8% higher than the day before,\nand the intraday high was 7.9% higher. The following day, all three price com-\nponents moved higher with the intraday high topping out at 8.7%, the low was\n8.5% higher, and the close was 7.9% higher than the reference day’s high, low,\nand close, respectively.\nWhat does the chart mean? If you own stock and it jumps over 5%, Fig-\nure 55.2 shows the average price behavior for the next month. After the initial\nmove, expect a higher high, higher low, and higher close the following day.\n846\nDead-Cat Bounce, Inverted\n",

Now that I am a more active trader (to prevent such drawdowns), I\nknow it is smart to take profit if price shoots up 5% or more.\nTable 55.1 shows trading tactics for the inverted dead-cat bounce. I base\nthe tactics on the graphs discussed in the Statistics section. Since the graphs\nrepresent average price changes, your results will vary. Before trading, ask\nyourself if you should sell a holding to preserve profits.

However, if someone sells you a\nlegal dollar bill for 80 cents, consider taking it. Twenty percent rises are rare\nin stocks, so sell because price will likely go down in the coming days. You can\nalways buy back in once price bottoms.\nMeasure the rise. Say a stock you own jumps from a closing price of 10\nto 12, for a 20% rise. Consult Figure 55.5 to see the average profile for price\naction over the coming month. Whether your situation will pan out like that\nshown in the figure is anyone’s guess. Still, consider the profile as you make\nyour trading plan.\nRises: 5% to 20%. All four profiles (Figures 55.2 through 55.5) suggest\nselling the day after a large rise. You may want to put a sell order at the intra-\nday high price of the event day (day 1). For example, if price rises 10% and\npeaks at 20 but closes at 19, put a limit order to sell at 20 the next day and see\nif it hits. If price looks like it is peaking without reaching 20, change the limit\norder into a market order and get out.

What happens beyond that is usually stock, industry,\nand market related. If the stock market shoots up, chances are your stock will\ndo well and post a higher high on day 2. Buy back in on weakness and watch\nthe market, industry, and the stock closely. If price looks like it is peaking then\nsell. By peaking, I mean look for bearish chart patterns or indicators that show\ndivergence (an indicator moves down forming lower lows, but the stock shows\nhigher highs), failure swings (little M-shaped patterns at indicator extremes\nsuggesting a short-term trend change), or overbought signals.\nLet us take an example using the stock shown in Figure 55.6.

The results surprised\nme, but market direction may have little to do with breakout direction.\nIn this chapter, I explore earnings announcements with downward break-\nouts only. I assumed that these were the bad earnings surprises. I also filtered\nthe 2,234 announcements by those with intraday trading ranges that were\nwider than average.\nThe performance of what remained appears in the Results Snapshot. The\nevent pattern usually acts as a short-term bearish continuation, not a reversal\nof the prevailing price trend. In many cases, the price trend leading to the pat-\ntern was down and so was the breakout. The break-even failure rate is high,\n31% and 26%, for bull and bear markets, respectively. I consider anything\nabove 20% to be unacceptable, so this event pattern is well out of the ballpark;\ntrade it with care.\nThe decline is just a bit shy of other event patterns, averaging 13% and\n17% for bull and bear markets. Once price reaches the ultimate low, it soars by\n51% in a bull market and 37% in a bear market. If you can catch this turn, then\nyou can make a lot of money.\nOn the announcement day, volume is heavy (above the monthly average).\nPullbacks occur just over a third of the time (41% and 45% in bull and bear\nmarkets), which is somewhat less than the 50% return rate for other event pat-\nterns.

This pattern is bearish, so it works best\nin a bear market when the company’s stock price is tumbling. The best per-\nforming patterns are those that appear within a third of the yearly low. Prices\ndecline by 20%, on average.

Price resumed its\ndescent in late February, eventually reaching a new low of 15.31.\nFrom the breakout price of 43.75 to the ultimate low of 27.25, the\ndecline measured 38%.

One reason for the poor performance may be support below the\npattern. Consider Figure 56.3. Price breaks out downward the day following\nthe announcement. On that day, the trading range was wide and the close was\nnear the daily low. This scenario suggested a lower low the next day, but the\nstock closed up sharply and then continued trending higher on following days.\nThe support zone in late 2002 stopped the decline in late January and\nApril. Nearby support in early April suggested price might stop there, too.\nAnother clue to failure is a rising price trend. From the March low, price\nclimbed quite rapidly for a week and then began rounding over. At the time of\nthe earnings announcement, price looked like a spiky head-and-shoulders top\n(or a diamond), but the HST never confirmed. If you can, always trade with the\nprevailing price trend.

Wait for the bounce\nand then sell as price rounds over at the top just before a renewed decline.\nUsually the decline from this pattern is not severe (see Table 56.3 to see\nhow many patterns fail to drop far). If you can stomach the loss, then hang in\nthere, especially if it is a bull market and price is trending upward. However,\nsometimes the pattern acts as a reversal of the uptrend. Sell immediately or\nwait for a correctly positioned stop loss to take you out of an existing position.\nRemember, changes that affect earnings usually take longer than a quar-\nter to fix, so if the company disappointed this quarter, there is a good chance it\nwill do so again next quarter. I verified this prediction by looking at 1,963\nearnings announcements. There were 866 consecutive earnings announcements\nwith upward breakouts and 582 with downward breakouts (the pattern acted as\na continuation of the price trend). In 515 additional cases, the breakout direc-\ntion flipped from down to up or up to down from quarter to quarter (price\nreversals). Thus, 74% of the earnings announcements (866 + 582 out of 1,963)\nfollow announcements having the same breakout direction. If one quarter is\nbad, there is a 74% probability that another bad quarter will follow.\nSell short signal. Performance from this pattern is poor, so I suggest you\nlook for other event patterns to short. If you have a compelling situation, then\nreview the “For Best Performance” section. The stock should be traded in a\nbear market and the price trend leading to the announcement should be down-\nward. When price closes below the intraday low posted on the announcement\nday, then that is the sell short signal. Watch the stock closely as half the pat-\nterns bottom in the first week. Lower your stop as the stock declines. Keep an\neye on the stock 4 to 5 weeks into the trade as price sometimes rebounds then.\n864\nEarnings Surprise, Bad\nTable 56.7\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nSell signal\nFor intermediate- or long-term holders, do nothing, as the\ndecline is likely to be small. For swing traders, consider selling\nimmediately to minimize the loss. If price gaps down and the\ngap is small, price may retrace the next few days and cover\nthe gap.\nSell short signal\nIn a bear market, wait for a close below the pattern’s low and\nthen short the stock. It may bottom in a week, so watch it\nclosely. Use stops to protect your profits. \nMeasure rule\nUsed to predict a price target. On the announcement day,\nsubtract the intraday low from the high, and subtract the\ndifference from the intraday low. The result is the target\nprice. Price hits the target 69% of the time in a bull market\nand 68% in a bear market.\nWait for confirmation\nTraders can react to an announcement by pushing price in\nany direction.

Price reaches the target almost 70% of\nthe time. This figure is below the 80% I like to see, so be conservative in your\ntarget estimate.\nWait for confirmation. Since the breakout direction is unknown until it\nhappens, wait for price to close below the intraday low posted on the day of the\nannouncement. When that happens, it confirms that you have a valid pattern\nand it signals a trade.\nSample Trade\nHow do you trade a bad earnings surprise? Look at Figure 56.4 for an exam-\nple.

After price declined for several months, the earnings announcement\nseemed to breathe life into the stock. Price jumped upward, but ran out of\nenergy in a week. It then headed down and completed a throwback to the\nbreakout price. Over the next several months, price climbed to just above 30,\na rise of 30% from the breakout price.\nThis GES resembles an earnings flag pattern. Price makes a sharp,\nstraight-line run and then pauses. Unfortunately, price breaks out downward\nfrom the pennant portion of the earnings flag, invalidating the pattern.\nFocus on Failures\nPretend you own stock in CDI, pictured in Figure 57.3.

The turn\nmay not be graceful, but it often follows a trend line drawn along the low prices.\nThink of this behavior as a flag or pennant, perhaps one that slopes upward (a\nflag or pennant usually slopes opposite the prevailing price trend). A trend-line\npierce is a signal to sell a long holding or short a new position. In Figure 58.2,\nprice follows the trend line until piercing it, moving downward, in early April.\nFigure 58.3 shows another example of the inverted J pattern. On April 10,\n1996, a news report said that Coherent received FDA approval to market a laser\nthat removed skin marks such as tattoos and birthmarks. The stock climbed, peak-\ning in about 5 weeks before heading lower. A trend line drawn along the three\nminor lows in April–May set up a sell or sell short signal that occurred about 3\nweeks later. The stock tumbled, but not before briefly climbing above the sell\nshort price in mid-June. In September, the stock reached a low of about 15.\nFocus on Failures\nThe major failure from this pattern comes from traders believing they can make\nmoney trading it. Consider Figure 58.4. The inverted J price pattern appears\nafter news reports that the FDA approved a drug in July. Price reaches a minor\nhigh at point A before declining to D. With this decline, there is no trend-line\n884\nFDA Drug Approvals\n",

Now we can draw a trend line connect-\ning the low at D to the low below B. The trend line, D–F, marks the sell short\nline. A close below this trend line is the signal. If you sold short at the close\nbelow the trend line and bought the stock back at the low—a perfect trade—\nyou would have made just 16%. In the real world, no one trades perfectly, so\nyour results after expenses would have been less. Would the trade have been\nworth the risk of a short?\nA head-and-shoulders top appears as the pattern ABC. A close below the\nneckline, DE, is another sell signal. Even so, the stock does not decline much\nbelow the neckline before reversing.\nWhen do you short? That is the major problem with the J-shaped chart\npattern I have described. If you can correctly draw a trend line that price\npierces, great! Otherwise, it becomes a guessing game. Image if Figure 58.4\nshows price continuing the decline from point D.

How well did you do?\nStatistics\nThe statistics shown in the following tables pertain to all FDA drug approvals\nthat I looked at and that met the first set of identification guidelines, not those\npertaining to the J-shaped pattern. (I did an informal study of the J-shaped\npattern, and the Trading Tactics section discusses those results.) The general\nstatistics appear in Table 58.2.\nNumber of formations. The number of drug approvals split evenly\nbetween upward and downward breakouts but were not numerous enough to\ndivide into bull and bear markets. For such a positive event as an FDA drug\napproval, it surprised me that price dropped half the time. I found 191 patterns\nin 31 unique stocks from 1995 to 2004 that met the identification guidelines.\nReversal or continuation. A slight majority of the patterns acted as con-\ntinuations of the prevailing price trend, not reversals. This finding means that\nthe approval did not change the direction of the trend. That result comes as a\nsurprise as I would have expected an approval in a declining market to send a\nstock shooting upward. Even if it did not, I would expect price to be trending\nupward as the market anticipated an approval.\nReversals perform substantially better than do those acting as continua-\ntions. For example, in a bull market, price climbed 24% after a reversal but just\n17% after a continuation.\nAverage rise or decline.

However, I do know one thing to be true: The\nwider the intraday trading range on the announcement (or the next day), the\nbetter the performance.\nWhat does this finding mean? I measured the average trading range for\nthe month leading to the pattern and compared it to the range on the\nannouncement day. In mathematical terms, this is an average of the daily\nhigh–low differences of the prior month compared to the high–low range on\nthe announcement day. If the announcement day high–low range (ADHLR)\nwas larger than the average, the pattern tended to outperform. If the ADHLR\nwas twice the average, the pattern did better still with a lower failure rate. When\nthe ADHLR was 3 times the average, it did better still.

A buy signal occurs when price closes above the formation\nhigh. That high is called the breakout price or confirmation price. You must\nwait for confirmation. In too many cases, price turns down and drops below the\nflag low, meaning a pattern failure and a loss if you own the stock. In some\ncases, like that shown in Figure 59.1, you can get a jump by buying when price\npierces a trend line. That strategy is fine providing a trend line fits the shape\nof the flag portion.\nConfirmation price. Look at Figure 59.3. For ease in gathering statis-\ntics, I used the highest high in the pattern as the confirmation price. When\nprice closes above that price, then the pattern becomes a valid earnings flag.\nThe figure shows the confirmation price as the horizontal line. However, if the\nflag slopes downward, as in this example and in Figure 59.1, consider buying\nnear point 2, when price begins its uphill climb away from the flag.

Point 1 is the announcement and\nit happens after nearly 2 months of downward price movement. Avoid all flags\nthat appear in a downtrend. Why?

Due to database limitations, not\nall stocks had quarterly earnings releases. Still, I found 564 earnings flags and\nTable 59.2 lists their general statistics.\nNumber of formations. I found 384 earnings flags in a bull market and\n180 in a bear market. These numbers suggest that there are more earnings\nflags in a bear market than a bull market (because the bear market is shorter),\nbut earnings at the start of the bull market period (1995) were scarce.\nReversal or continuation. Does the earnings flag act as a reversal or\ncontinuation of the prevailing price trend? Table 59.2 suggests that the pattern\nacts as a continuation of the short-term trend 76% of the time. If the price\ntrend was rising going into the earnings flag, chances are it will keep rising\nafter the breakout; that is the way to trade it, anyway.\nIn a bull market, earnings flags that act as reversals perform substantially\nbetter than do those acting as continuations. In a bear market, the trend is the\nsame but the results are narrower.\nAverage rise. The average rise in a bull market was 34%, but only 22%\nin a bear market. Both bull and bear market numbers are well above the 24%\nand 15% average rise for all event patterns, respectively.\nRises over 45%. Just over a quarter of the patterns (29%) in a bull mar-\nket and 14% in a bear market rise more than 45%. Again, performance is quite\ngood.\nChange after trend ends.

The drop measures from the\nhighest high after the breakout to the lowest low—a perfect trade and one you\nare unlikely to make.\nStandard & Poor’s 500 change. Computing the change in the index from\nthe date the earnings flag started to the ultimate high gives a 7% rise in a bull\nmarket and 1% gain in a bear market. This performance compares to a 34% and\n22% average rise, respectively, for the earnings flag over the same period.\nDays to ultimate high. If you trade this pattern perfectly, how long will\nit take to reach the point of maximum profit? Answer: in a bull market, 114\ndays, or about 4 months; in bear markets, just over 2 months (80 days). The rise\nin a bull market is slightly steeper than the rise in a bear market.\nTable 59.3 shows a list of failure rates, beginning with the 5% or break-\neven failure rate. That is the rate I use to cover brokerage commissions, slip-\npage, SEC fees, and so forth. The table shows how often earnings flags fail to\nrise a given amount. For example, a third (33%) of the bull patterns and almost\nhalf of the bear patterns failed to rise more than 15% after the breakout.\nWhat is alarming about the table, and seems to be the case for many chart\nand event patterns, is the rapid rise in failures for small changes in the maxi-\nmum price rise. For example, the failure rates double from 5% to 10% and\nthen leaps again. Since every trade is different, your results will vary. Play it\nsafe and always use stops.\nSuppose your trading costs amount to 5% and you want to make 10% on\nevery trade. That totals 15%, but you know you will not win every trade. It has\nbeen your experience that you win every two out of three trades. Therefore, if you\nboost the profit margin to 20% (25% with expenses), that will compensate for the\nlosers, leaving a 10% average profit on all three trades.

The best performance comes from pat-\nterns within a third of the yearly low. They had rises averaging 48% in a bull\nmarket and 30% in a bear market. Apparently, few expected earnings to sur-\nprise when the stock was so low.\nDoes that finding mean you should buy stocks with earnings flags near the\nyearly low? I checked the median percentage move and, sure enough, the low-\nest third showed the best performance with a median rise of 36%. The middle\nrange scored gains of 24% and the highest third had a median rise of 25%.\nI will confess that I buy earnings flags if the stock is near the yearly high,\nnever anywhere else, and always in a price uptrend.

The average decline is meager, too (12% to 14%).\nAfter reaching the ultimate low, what happens to price? On average, it climbs\n54% in bull markets and 39% in bear markets. Wow!

It made a broadening top pattern beginning in April, \none I hesitate to show because of the amount of white space (it would look\nbetter if the mid-May peak touched the top trend line). Nothing is perfect in\nthe chart pattern business, and it was not until prices peaked in June that the\ntopping pattern appeared drawn properly.

Apparently, a few patterns pull the\naverage upward.\nYearly position. Where in the yearly price range does the breakout from\na 3S pattern appear most often? The answer depends on the market.

Mapping performance over the yearly\nprice range, we find that the best performing 3S patterns have breakouts in the\ncenter third of the range.\nOne explanation for this finding is that companies with stocks making\nnew highs are performing well. Then gray clouds gather and the stock begins\neasing down as if seeking shelter from the storm. Same-store sales come in\nbelow plan and the stock tumbles in earnest. More 3S patterns occur, driving\nthe stock into the middle range. As the stock nears the yearly low, things begin\nturning up and fewer 3S patterns appear. The stock recovers and starts the\ncycle again.\nPullbacks. How often does a pullback occur? Over half the time—53%\nand 60% for bull and bear markets, respectively.

For example, patterns in a bull market show-\ning a pullback decline 10%; those without a pullback decline 13%, on average.\nI think of these results in terms of momentum. Price drops and downward\nmomentum builds, but when a pullback occurs, the direction shifts upward,\nkilling the downward momentum. When the pullback completes, the down-\nward momentum resumes but with less enthusiasm. Thus, price tends not to\ndecline as far after a pullback.\nTable 60.5 shows a frequency distribution of the days to the ultimate low.\nMost of the bull market 3S patterns (50%) reach the low in less than a week.\nPrice in over half (57%, the sum of the 7- and 14-day columns) of the bear\nmarket patterns trend upward within 2 weeks.

Use the measure rule to set a price target for the stock.\nUsing announcement day prices, compute the pattern height by subtracting\nthe intraday low from the high, and then subtract the difference from the intra-\nday low. The result is the target price. Over two-thirds of the patterns decline\nto the target price or lower, but getting there may be bumpy. It may be that\nyour pattern falls in the other 32%, so protect your wallet with stops.\nFor example, suppose a stock shows a 3S pattern with an intraday high of\n10 and a low of 8. To what price may the stock decline after the downward\nbreakout? Answer: 6. Find the pattern height (10 – 8 or $2). Subtract the dif-\nference (2) from the intraday low (8) to get the price target. If the result ever\ngoes negative, then ignore it. Chances are your stock will not go bankrupt.\nIf the decline seems unusually large, check Table 60.3. In this example,\nthe $2 decline represents a 25% drop from 8. What are the chances that the\nstock will fall that far? According to Table 60.3, 86% of the stocks in a bull\nmarket and 81% in a bear market have 3S patterns that fail to drop at least\n25%.

Earnings came out in mid-November and the market was not impressed:\nThe stock continued down for a week and then recovered before sliding again\nin mid- December.\nIn early January, the newspaper said that same-store sales were flat. The\nstock tumbled almost 2 points on the news.

      "text": "If you follow the retailing industry, you know about same-store sales (3S) num-\nbers. Some analysts call them comparable or existing store sales. They are sales\nfrom stores open longer than a year (but sometimes 2 years). The difference\nbetween 3S and regular sales is store openings. If a retailer opens new stores\nwithout closing old ones, expect sales volume to rise, perhaps substantially.\nThus, year-to-year comparisons for fast growing retailers are difficult. Using\n3S, the comparison is easier. If same-store sales rise by 8% this quarter com-\npared to the same quarter last year, then that is better than if the retailer added\n25% more outlets and total sales climbed by 8%. The sales climb might be due\nentirely to the new store sales volume even as existing stores suffered. Thus,\nsame-store sales numbers are important to investors.\nThe Results Snapshot paints a picture of carnage. When a retailer\nannounces monthly or quarterly 3S, the stock price can move up, down, or go\nnowhere. This chapter excludes the latter two possibilities. In fact, I only\ninclude above average price moves on the day of the announcement or the next\nday, or those with a discernible price gap on the announcement day. Thus, this\nchapter looks at positive surprises. The reason for using only positive surprises is\nto find tradable patterns. If a 3S day looks like any other day, do we care to\ntrade the event?\nSince I only included patterns with upward breakouts, the 3S pattern usu-\nally acts as a short-term continuation of the prevailing bullish price trend. The\nbreak-even failure rate is very high, at 20% in a bull market and a massive 27%\nin a bear market, with 20% being the threshold for awful. By comparison,\nwell-behaved bullish chart patterns have break-even failure rates in the single\ndigits. The average rise is a weak 23% and 14% in bull and bear markets,\nrespectively, as measured from the breakout price.\nSay you buy a stock showing a 3S pattern. What happens? Price rises,\nsure, but only for a few weeks. Half the patterns reach the ultimate high in 2 to\n4 weeks. Then what happens? The drop is breathtaking—a 28% drop in a bull\nmarket and 31% in a bear market. Do you want to risk that size loss? If you are\nan experienced trader who loves risk, a 31% decline is mouthwatering. Short\nthe stock and I explain what to look for later.\nTour\nFigure 61.1 shows an example of a 3S pattern formed in response to better than\nexpected same-store sales numbers. In early December, Circuit City reported\nNovember same-store sales were down 2% from the prior year and down 4%\nfor the quarter. The stock gapped up on the news, suggesting that as bad as the\nnumbers were, traders expected worse. Bad news was good news.\nThe day before the announcement, the stock closed at 18.69. It formed a\nshark-32 pattern, which looks like a midget symmetrical triangle, and then\ncontinued rising. Eventually, price topped out at 31.40, for a gain of 68%.

On the day of the announcement, look for a large\nprice swing (a wide trading range). Prices should move up, perhaps even gap\nupward. If they do not move much or if the trading range is unremarkable,\nthen keep looking. Figure 61.2 shows three examples of good patterns.\nIn the first two cases, the daily low is near the prior day’s high. In the\nAugust example, price gaps upward. We are looking for good news that surprises\nthe market, boosting the price. How you choose to define a large move is up to\nyou. I included days that gapped upward or had a large trading range that day or\nthe following day. Why the next day? Because the markets may be closed during\nthe announcement and any price move would occur the next day. If the stock did\nnot react to the announcement, I ignored it. Table 61.1 lists what to look for.\nAnnouncement. I learn of same-store sales announcements from the\nnewspaper. Occasionally they appear on television, especially for the larger\nretailers.

They\nhave upward breakouts and they gap upward or show an above average trading\nrange on the announcement day or the day after.\nIn the April announcement, price climbs and rounds over in a week and\ntumbles, ending well below the close the day before the announcement. That\ncurling action is an example of a throwback. The May announcement shows an\nupward price gap, price rises for another day and then it retraces in a flag pat-\ntern. After the flag, price resumes its climb in a stair-step manner. The June 3S\npattern is similar to April, only wider. Price rounds over and finds support at\nthe announcement day gap. Most of the time (91%), price will stop before\nreaching the bottom of the gap.\nThe July pattern looks a lot like the April pattern, including the decline\nafterward.

Less than 2 weeks later,\nanother brokerage firm increased the price target for the stock (a bullish\nstance). Based on the resulting tumble, that increase was a bad call.\nQuarterly earnings arrived in mid-April, and even though the company\nreported better than expected earnings, a report warned of falling margins and\na cautious outlook.

When\nthe company released earnings, they were worse than expected and two brokers\ndowngraded the stock. Look how close to the bottom the February down-\ngrade was. Wow!

For\nexample, when a pullback occurs, price declines 11% in a bull market. With-\nout a pullback, the decline averages 17%. Many other chart and event patterns\nshow this same result for both bull and bear markets.\nTable 62.5 shows a frequency distribution of the days to the ultimate\nhigh or low. Yawn, right? Nothing is more boring than staring at a table full of\nnumbers. Would you like to know when to sell? The table will not tell you\nthat, but it does hint that half the patterns reach their ultimate high or low in\nthe first week or two. About two out of three will top or bottom in about three\nweeks.

This table reinforces the belief that you\nshould be prepared to take profits quickly.\nTable 62.6 shows size and volume statistics for patterns forming in reac-\ntion to stock downgrades.\nHeight. I found the median height for a given breakout direction as a\npercentage of the breakout price and then sorted the patterns into tall and\nshort. Tall patterns performed substantially better than short ones in all com-\nbinations. For example, in a bear market with an upward breakout, short pat-\nterns had gains averaging 9%. Tall patterns scored rises averaging more than\ndouble—19%. This finding confirms one of my selection criteria: a large price\nrange (taller than the 1-month average). Patterns 2 or 3 times the average\nheight perform better still (higher profit) and have a lower failure rate.\nAnnouncement day volume. I compared the announcement day volume\nwith the average daily volume over the prior month and then looked at per-\nformance for above and below average volume announcements.

The Result Snapshot (“Percentage meeting\nprice target”) shows how often this method works.\nBuy signal. Do not buy a stock after a broker downgrade unless you have\na compelling reason to do so. In many cases, the downgrade may be near a\ntrend change (from down to up), meaning that the downgrade often comes\nnear the yearly low, just as price is about to recover. Wait for it to bottom and\nthen buy cautiously as more downside may become apparent.\nSell signal—down breakouts. If you own the stock, sell immediately, or\npray for a pullback and sell then.

His\nwin-loss ratio was strong. Not every trade was profitable, but he narrowed his\nlosses and tried to let his profits run. He did everything right until he became\nbored with making money. Trading was no longer exciting, as if the bear mar-\nket of the last 3 years took the fun out of it. He decided to try a new technique\n(see Figure 62.5).\nDon kept his eye on Amgen and watched it rise from the July 2002 low\nnear 30 (not shown). “Drug stocks are volatile, and volatility spells a profit\nSample Trade—Downward Breakout\n945\nTable 62.7\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nUsed to predict a target price. Using the day of the downgrade,\ncompute the height by subtracting the intraday low from the\nintraday high. For upward breakouts, add the result to the daily\nhigh; for downward breakouts subtract it from the daily low.\nThe result is the target price. This method works between 64%\nand 71% of the time.\nBuy signal\nNone. Do not buy after a broker downgrades the stock. Most\nlikely, price is going to drop. \nSell signal—down \nFor downward breakouts, sell a long holding immediately or sell \nbreakouts\nafter price turns down after a pullback. \nSell signal—up \nPrice peaks in 1 to 3 weeks after the downgrade, so consider \nbreakouts\nselling as price rounds over after an upward breakout.\nShort the stock—\nSelling short is risky and downgrades are not reliable short \ndown breakouts\ncandidates. Too often, price drops for a week or two and then\nrecovers. If you still want to short, sell immediately and use\nstops to limit losses. The best performance comes from\ndowngrades within a third of the yearly low, so check for that.\nShort the stock—\nIf the breakout is upward, watch the stock as it climbs. It may \nup breakouts\ntop out quickly. When it starts heading down, short it. Use stops\nto protect your wallet (or purse). See Sample Trade—Upward\nBreakout—for an example.\n",

      "text": "Confusing news came from brokerage firms. Some were downgrading\nthe stock even as the company announced better than expected earnings. Oth-\ners made positive comments, then changed their minds and downgraded the\nstock after it peaked. The day after the gap, another brokerage firm made pos-\nitive comments and set a new price target. That news helped push the price up.\nThe stock pulled back to the diagonal May trend line but could not jump over\nthe gap before declining.\nAny time after point A was the time to short the stock. A pullback often\nprecedes a decline and that is the way to trade this chart. If you draw a trend\nline connecting the lows, you could short the stock once it closed below that\ntrend line (the short diagonal trend line starting in August, as shown).\nHow far would price decline? I would expect a pause at the bottom of the\nlate May to July horizontal consolidation (at about 20), for a meager 10%\ndecline. If price bored through that level, then the next support zone was the\ntwo valleys in April and May at around 17, for a 23% decline (the horizontal\nsupport line).\nAs you can see, price drilled through the first support zone at 20. The\ncompany released earnings and they were well below what was expected, but\nthe stock soared that day. The next day, several large brokerage firms stam-\npeded for the door in their hurry to cut estimates. The stock gave back all it\ngained from the prior day, and more.\nPrice did find support at the next zone, as shown (point B). Price climbed\nto C, the level of the prior support/resistance zone at 20, and then dropped.\nThe ABCD pattern is a measured move down formation. The move from\nC to D should mirror the decline from A to B. Thus, if you do the math, it\ngives a target as shown, just above point D. The stock declined to the target\nand dropped to D before double bottoming (point D and the December low).\nTo exit the trade, you can get out as the target neared. Waiting for price\nto actually meet the target is not wise because it often falls short. In this case,\neverything worked out. Refer to Chapter 32 on the measured move down for\nmore information.\nShorting a stock is not for the novice. It entails unlimited risk as Don dis-\ncovered in the first sample trade. However, if you discover a downgrade with\nan upward breakout that rounds over, keep this chapter in mind. Do your\nhomework on the fundamentals and make sure you have valid technical and\nfundaments reasons for shorting a stock. Use proper money management tech-\nniques to limit losses if you decide to trade it.\nFor Best Performance\nThe following list includes tips and observations that may help you select pat-\nterns to improve your trading performance.

You hear about the announcement on the television\nor read about it in the newspaper the next day. Which way will price move?\nAbout two out of three times (65%), the stock will move higher, as expected,\nand break out upward, climbing an average of 24% in a bull market. Then\nprice tumbles 30%, giving back its gains and more.\nIf the stock has a downward breakout, expect price to continue moving\ndown an average of 12% in a bull market before the decline stops. Then price\nclimbs by 44%. Both breakout directions spell a trading opportunity, but not\nin the direction you expect. More about the new trading patterns later.\nSurprising findings include the usual culprits and new ones as well. A\nlarge number (35%) of stocks have downward breakouts after an upgrade. If\nthe breakout is downward, over half begin a sustained rise (over 20%) within a\nweek. For upward breakouts, the reverse is true: Nearly half decline substan-\ntially (over 20%) within 2 weeks. I discuss these surprises later in the chapter.\nTour\nFigure 63.1 shows what I expected to see after a brokerage firm upgraded Dell.\nOn the day of the announcement, price closed at the daily high.

The research from this chapter shows that the mar-\nket’s reaction to a broker’s optimistic upgrade is not what many expect. It may\nbe a case of Wall Street saying, “buy on the rumor, and sell on the news.” In\nsome cases, the upgrade is prescient as prices climb. However, in too many\nexamples, the climb is brief and prices tumble.\nFigure 63.4 is another example of bad timing.

More about trading tactics later in the chapter.\nThe table shows how quickly prices reach the floor or ceiling. For down-\nward breakouts in a bull market, 53% reach the ultimate low in a week and then\nclimb by at least 20%. Bear markets with downward breakouts are similar, with\n50% hitting bottom in the first week. In another week, 66% bottom out (50%\n+ 16%). Only bull markets with up breakouts take their time reaching the ulti-\nmate high. Over a third (35%) top out in the first week. A quarter of the pat-\nterns (29%) do not reach the high in less than 2 months (over 70 days).\nTable 63.6 shows size and volume statistics.\nHeight. Tall patterns perform substantially better than short ones.\nUpward breakouts in bear markets, for example, do twice as well as short pat-\nterns—with rises of 22% versus 11%, respectively.\nTo use this finding, compute the formation height by subtracting the\nintraday low from the high using prices from the day of the stock upgrade.\nDivide the result by the breakout price, which for upward breakouts is the\nintraday high; for downward breakouts, use the intraday low. Compare the\nresult by the median listed in the table to determine whether your pattern is\nshort or tall. For best average results, select tall patterns and ignore short ones.\nAnnouncement day volume. I compared the announcement day volume\nwith the average of the prior month and then mapped performance according\nto whether the announcement day volume was above or below average.\nAnnouncements accompanying high volume performed better than did those\nwith low volume, except bull markets with upward breakouts. They climbed\n30% on light announcement day volume and 23% when volume was above\naverage. In all cases, the sample size was small, so the results may change.\n960\nStock Upgrades\nTable 63.6\nSize and Volume Statistics\nBull\nBear\nBull\nBear\nMarket,\nMarket,\nMarket,\nMarket,\nUp\nUp\nDown\nDown\nDescription\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nBreakout\nTall pattern performance\n29%\n22%\n–15%\n–22%\nShort pattern performance\n20%\n11%\n–11%\n–14%\nMedian height as a percentage \n5.61%\n6.10%\n5.32%\n5.25%\nof breakout price\nHeavy announcement day \nvolume, performance\n23%\n16%\n–12%\n–18%\nLight announcement day \nvolume, performance\n30%a\n11%a\n–12%a\n–13%a\nNote: Minus sign means decline.\naFewer than 30 samples.\n",

In addition, the following sample\ntrades use most of them.\nSample Trade—Downward Breakout\nFigure 63.5 illustrates a sample trade when a stock breaks out downward after\nan upgrade. In mid-February, the stock received an upgrade from a broker and\nit gapped higher. The next day, prices dropped, closing below the low of the\nprior day and signaling a downward breakout.\nBill’s hobby is trading stocks when it is too inclement to play golf, and he\nis an experienced trader. He liked Big Lots and watched the stock for months.\nWhen a broker announced the upgrade in February, that boosted his confi-\ndence in the stock.\nSince the breakout was downward, he held off buying, suspecting that the\ngap would support the stock. He was right as prices paused there. However, he\nknew that sometimes they continued down, so he waited to place his buy order.\nHe applied the measure rule to the upgrade. On that day, the stock\nreached an intraday high of 15.68 and a low of 15.12, giving a height of 56\nSample Trade—Downward Breakout\n961\nTable 63.7\nTrading Tactics\nTrading Tactic\nExplanation\nMeasure rule\nUsed to predict a target price. Using the day of the upgrade,\ncompute the height by subtracting the intraday low from the\nintraday high. For upward breakouts, add the result to the\nintraday high; for downward breakouts subtract it from the\nintraday low. The result is the target price. Price meets the\ntarget between 67% and 81% of the time (see Results\nSnapshot, “Percentage meeting price target”).\nBuy signal\nAfter a downward breakout, prices drop and then start\nrecovering. Buy when you are sure prices are rising. Use\nstops in case you are wrong and to lock in profits.\nSell signal\nAfter an upward breakout, prices rise, curl over, and then\nhead down. Sell short near the peak and use stops to protect\nyour gains.\nIf you own the stock\nIf you own the stock, watch the breakout direction. If it\nbreaks out downward, sell immediately or buy more after the\nstock bottoms. If the breakout is upward, hold onto your\nstock until it peaks and then consider selling.\nWait for confirmation\nWait for price to close above the daily high or below the\ndaily low before trading.\n",

It took\nanother 3 days before price closed above the high on the day of the upgrade. The\nstock rose, following an up trend line drawn along the price bottoms.\nFor kicks, Bill pulled out a ruler, held it up to the monitor, and measured\nthe height of the day when the upgrade occurred. It measured three-eighths of\nan inch. He slid the ruler to the right and saw that prices met the measure rule\n6 days after the upgrade (a day before prices peaked).\nWhen prices gapped through the trend line on news that same-store sales\ndeclined, Bill considered shorting the stock. He does not like shorting stocks, but\nthe fundamentals seemed to be on his side. Still, he worried about the support\nlevel at 21 to 22 and expected prices to stall there. He did not short the stock.\nTwo days later, prices pierced the lower boundary of the support zone.\nStill he waited. Another week saw prices dip below the zone, then pull back\ninto the zone, and then begin heading down again.

Also known as the breakout point, price, or level.\nConsolidation\nSynonym for “continuation” when talking about trends (as in\ntrend reversal or continuation). A consolidation region is a solid block of\nprices or a region in which prices switch from trending to moving side-\nways.\nContinuation\nSynonym for consolidation. For a continuation, prices must\nbreak out in the same direction as they entered the pattern. For example,\nif price enters the pattern from the bottom and exits out the top, the pat-\ntern acts as a continuation. Sometimes an adjustment is made to the trend\nstart (affecting the direction of entry) for prices that overshoot or under-\nshoot the start of the pattern.\nCorrective phase\nPart of a measured move up or down, a region where\nprices retrace a portion of the prior move.\nCountertrend pattern\nA pattern with an upward breakout in a bear market\nor a downward breakout in a bull market; that is, the breakout direction\nis against the prevailing market trend.\nDays to ultimate high or low\nThe average time from the breakout date to\nthe date of the ultimate high or low.\nDual bumps\nIn a bump-and-run reversal, prices bump up (or down) and\nthen return to the trend line two or more times.\nEnd (as in “pattern end”)\nUsually the highest high or lowest low in a chart\npattern. For example, the start and end of a double bottom is the lowest\nlow in each valley.\nFailure rate\nA measure of how many patterns fail to rise or decline a selected\namount (like 5%, 10% and so on). The failure rate includes all chart pat-\nterns of the selected type breaking out in the selected direction. Patterns\nbreaking out in an unexpected direction are no longer considered failures.\nFlat base\nA consolidation region in which prices touch or come near the\nsame price level multiple times over several weeks or months, for which\nidentification is usually easiest on the weekly scale. The bottom or top of\nthis region may appear flat and sometimes forms the base of an impend-\ning up move, hence the name, “flat base.”\nFormation end to breakout\nThe delay from the end of the pattern to the\nbreakout.\nFrequency distribution\nA method to assign data to one of several nonover-\nlapping intervals. A frequency distribution shows how often values occur.\nGap\nFor upward price trends, a gap is when today’s low price is above yes-\nterday’s high. For downward price trends, a gap occurs when today’s high\nprice is below yesterday’s low.\nGap performance\nComputed using the closing price the day before the gap\nto the ultimate high or low for those patterns that use a trend-line break-\nout. For patterns that use the highest high or lowest low as the breakout\nprice, the high or low substitutes for the prior close in the computation.\n",

The handle measures from the right cup lip to the breakout.\nHandle retrace\nFor inverted cup with handles, this is the rise from the right\ncup low to the handle high as a percentage of the cup height from the\nright cup to the highest high in the pattern.\nHeavy left/right volume performance\nA comparison of volume surround-\ning peaks or valleys using, 2 days before to 2 days after the peak or valley.\nInternal partial decline\nAn internal partial decline is the same as a partial\ndecline (see that entry) only the breakout fails to occur and the chart pat-\ntern continues developing. Look for two consecutive trend-line touches\nthat occur on the same side with a minor low between them (it looks like\na loop hanging off the trend line). The minor low should not come close\nto or touch the opposite trend line. An internal partial decline only occurs\nafter the chart pattern is valid, meaning at least two touches of each trend\nline. See Figure 1.\nInternal partial rise\nAn internal partial rise occurs within a chart pattern\nafter prices touch a lower trend line, rise, and then return to the lower\ntrend line without coming close to or touching the opposite trend line. A\nbreak out does not follow. Look for two consecutive trend-line touches to\noccur on the same side with a minor high between them (looking like a\nhill on the trend line). An internal partial rise is the same as a partial rise\n(see that entry) only a breakout does not follow and the chart pattern con-\ntinues developing. An internal partial rise only occurs after the chart pat-\ntern is valid, meaning at least two touches of each trend line. See Figure 1.\nLead-in height\nThe height from the trend line to the highest high (or low-\nest low) in the first quarter of a bump-and-run reversal.\nLinear regression\nA method that fits a straight line to a series of numbers;\nthe slope of the resulting line gives the trend. Used to find whether vol-\nume is trending upward or downward over the course of the chart pat-\ntern, from start to end, not to the breakout.\nMaximum price rise or decline\nUsed as the nonoverlapping intervals for a\nfrequency distribution of failure rates, this is an arbitrary list of bench-\nmark values (such as 5%, 10%, 15%, and so on).\nMeasure rule\nVaries from pattern to pattern but is usually the pattern height\nadded to (upward breakouts) or subtracted from (downward breakouts)\nthe breakout price. The result is the predicted price target. See “Percent\nmeeting price target” in the Results Snapshot of each chapter for how\noften prices hit their predicted targets.\nMedian\nThe median value is the middle one in a sorted list of values such\nthat half the values are below the median and half above. If no middle\nvalue exists, the average of the two closest values is used. For example, in\nthe list 10, 15, 30, 41, and 52, the median is 30 because there are two val-\nues on either side of it.\n988\nGlossary and Methodology\n",

To find the trend start,\nbegin at the formation start and move backward in time. If prices climb\nleading away from the formation, find the highest high before prices close\n20% or more below and before the highest high. When this occurs, the\nhighest high marks the trend start.\nIf prices drop leading away from the chart pattern (working back-\nward in time), find the lowest low before prices close 20% or more above\nand before the lowest low.

Price overshoots and undershoots just before the chart pattern\nare ignored.\nFor flags and pennants, the minor high or low closest to the start of\nthe trend leading to the flag or pennant is used (not a 20% trend change).\nUltimate high\nThe highest high before prices decline by 20% or more,\nmeasured from the highest high to the close or a close below the formation\nlow. If the stock had not suffered a 20% decline before the end of the data\n(because it was too recent), then the highest high to that point was used.\nUltimate low\nThe lowest low before a minimum 20% price rise, measured\nfrom the lowest low to the close, or a close above the formation high. If the\nstock had not suffered a 20% rise before the end of data, then the lowest\nlow to that point was used.\nUndershoot\nWhen price suddenly drops a few days before the beginning of\nthe pattern. Sometimes called “overshoot.”\nVolume shape\nThe pattern volume makes. Consists of several shapes: domed,\nU, flat, rising, falling, and random. The last four I call random and lump\ntogether because they occur infrequently. For short patterns, if no volume\nshape appears, look to the left and right of the pattern to see if volume is\npart of a larger shape. If so, use that shape in your analysis. For large chart\npatterns, if multiple shapes are present, use the most recent. See Figure 1.\nVolume trend\nA rising volume trend means volume generally increases over\ntime; a falling volume trend is one that recedes over time. The slope of a\nline found using linear regression on volume data determines the trend.\n",
