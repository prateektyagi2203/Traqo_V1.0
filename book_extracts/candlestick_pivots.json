      "text": "Additional Praise for\nCandlestick and Pivot Point \nTrading Triggers\n“Coming from the trading floor, it wasn’t until we started building charting\nsoftware that I realized how little I knew about the retail trader’s passion\nfor technical analysis. John’s latest book clearly defines many of the deli-\ncate intricacies of trading patterns and key turning points. I’m a junkie for\nthis type of stuff and I learned a ton from this book.”\n—Tom Sosnoff \nCEO, thinkorswim Group\n“As a professional options trader and teacher, I have always told my stu-\ndents that to be consistently successful in the markets, you must first \nidentify the opportunity and then apply the best strategy for you that fits\nthat opportunity. Candlestick and Pivot Point Trading Triggers is the an-\nswer to the first step: finding and identifying the best opportunities to trade.\nJohn breaks down pivot points, a sophisticated form of technical analysis,\nin a surprisingly simple way, and then combines it with candlesticks to cre-\nate a simple and easy-to-use system. This system, unlike most others, is\nconsistently able to predict highs and lows of stocks and other securities\nfor multiple timeframes with amazing accuracy. This is a great book for\ntraders of all experience levels and I am making it mandatory reading for all\nof my students.”\n—Ron Ianieri\nChief Options Strategist, The Options University\n“John Person has built his career on teaching investors how to understand\nand use technical analysis. The strategies described in Candlestick and\nPivot Point Trading Triggers are employed by professional traders every\ntrading session and are the lifeblood of futures and forex investors. If you\nwant a complete guide to why the smart money buys at this level and sells\nat that, you must read John’s book. I heartily endorse it!”\n—Jon “Doctor J” Najarian\nco-founder of www.optionmonster.com \n",

You will learn specifically what methods and parameters to\nuse with time-tested material. My first book, A Complete Guide to Techni-\ncal Trading Tactics, was released in April 2004. It was a great introductory\non how to incorporate pivot point analysis with other forms of technical in-\ndicators and how it related to trading commodities. The foresight that book\noffered suggested that we would see resurgence in commodity activity and\nthat commodity markets would soon be in vogue. I had chart examples of\nsilver at 4.50 per ounce and gold at 350 per ounce. On page 211, I gave an ex-\nample of a potentially great scale trading opportunity in coffee when it was\nas low as 49.00. Sugar was at 7.00. Crude oil was at 21.00. The 30-year bonds\nwere at 111. The Federal Funds interest rate was at 1.0 percent. There were\ngreat trading opportunities, many of which I was able to take advantage. \nTHINGS CHANGE\nTimes changed, as did prices of these raw commodities. Other hard asset\nproducts, including housing and real estate, besides the commodity mar-\nkets, skyrocketed in value. Things changed; global tensions mounted as we\n",

Global\neconomic growth pushed demand for products through the roof, creating\nspectacular price gains. Things changed alright, even intermarket relation-\nships. Gold went up on fears of inflationary pressures in light of the Federal\nReserve (Fed) raising interest rates. In turn, the U.S. dollar rallied as the in-\nterest rate differentials widened here in the United States against foreign\ncentral banks.\nTHE CONUNDRUM\nOne favorite word among economists in 2005 was conundrum, which was\nused by then-chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan. This was\nthe term he used to describe the event of Treasury yields declining while\nthe Fed was raising interest rates. The Federal Reserve moved to raise in-\nterest rates 14 consecutive times in 0.25 percent increments in an effort to\nreduce inflationary pressures. Bond yields, instead of moving in tandem\nwith the Fed’s rate hikes, declined. Short-term Treasury instruments were\nyielding more than longer-term, and what developed was known as a flat-\ntening of the yield curve. At some points, we even had an inversion effect,\nwhere longer-term interest rate instrument yields were lower than shorter-\nterm. Throughout history, that is a sign that the economy will soon proceed\ninto a recession. \nHISTORY SHOULD REPEAT ITSELF\nOften it is said that history repeats itself. Economies and the world move in\ncycles. Based on the market’s price behavior and the climb that commod-\nity prices had, intermarket relationships were not moving in a traditional\nway in 2005, or at least not in a manner in which they had in the past. His-\ntory should have repeated itself, but it did not; or if it does, it will be a de-\nlayed reaction. Due to this keen observation, there was one solid piece of\nadvice I was constantly giving to people through our trading room or in my\nnewsletter advisory service. It was, “Trade the markets independently of\neach other.” One reason for this advice was this: Not much was making\nsense at times in the traditional way. Let’s face it, when crude oil or ener-\ngies shoot to the moon, it is inflationary and has a taxing effect on con-\nsumers. We would have expected stocks to sell off sharply, and they did not\n(they did not rally much either in 2005). When federal deficits soar, it cre-\nates inflationary pressures; when the Fed raises interest rates, yields should\n2\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

Gold was the only mover that\nacted in response to investors’ demand for protection on resurgence in in-\nflation. In fact, at times, price swings of gold interacted well with crude oil.\nDELAYED REACTION\nAs of February 2006, the U.S. economy was in its third year of an economic\nrecovery. It remained a stock picker’s market, as we did see stellar moves\nfrom Apple, Rambus, AMD, and other lost hopefuls. But there were other\ninvestors who were expanding their knowledge in trading other investment\nassets, such as foreign currencies. There were others who made fortunes in\nreal estate. Unemployment in January 2006 was reported at 4.7 percent.\nTimes were good and were probably going to remain good forever! Well,\nthat’s where I must say, “You can’t cheat history.” As the old saying goes, if\nit’s got four legs and a tail, it’s probably an animal. I see a delayed reaction\nand an economic downturn. Will it be the end of civilization as we know it\ntoday? I doubt it. However, I believe we will go into a period of an economic\nslowdown. Why? For starters, usually we see energy and commodity prices\nrally near the peak of an economic upturn. Then, as the Fed fights inflation,\nthey will continue to put the brakes on and continue to raise interest rates.\nSince no one knows for sure how soon or by how much consumers will ad-\njust their spending habits, usually the Fed will go too far. That will slow bor-\nrowing and increase debt payments, especially on all those adjustable\nmortgage rates (ARMs) that so many people have. Yes, I believe an eco-\nnomic downturn will occur. I just believe it will be a delayed reaction. It\nseems that most cycles have stretched a little further than people believe.\nJust ask all the folks who predicted a stock market crash in 1999. They\nwere right, but quite a bit off in their timing.  That leaves one to wonder\nwhere to go to make money.\nTRADING FOR A LIVING\nIf you don’t already know of my past, I started in the business as a runner\non the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange back in the late 1970s. I\nhad the privilege of working with a true master trader, George Lane, the\ncreator of stochastics. I had a knack for the financial markets and learned\nto trade the 30-year bonds. I also discovered how to use pivot points and\nhow to incorporate longer-term time periods in my analysis. Then came op-\ntions on commodities; and in 1986 I made a fortune for myself and others in\nIntroduction\n3\n",

I gradually improved my techniques; and through the un-\nderstanding of candle charts while using them in conjunction with pivot\npoints, I have developed quite a methodology that shows a high frequency\nof recurring patterns. This is what I believe is one of the single best meth-\nods for identifying market moves for various trading vehicles. Trading for a\nliving is a fabulous career. Now more than ever, we have global market in-\nfluences, advanced technology, equal access, market liquidity, and, best of\nall, diversified markets investment vehicles. We have forex, or foreign cur-\nrency exchange; futures products to day trade; and commodities that allow\nspeculators to participate in a structured, regulated, open marketplace that\noffers leverage. Then we have stocks to participate in investing for long-\nterm growth. And there is a new breed of investment asset, exchange\ntraded funds.

In other words, the markets are\ncompletely unpredictable.\nI fall in the category of believing that history can and does repeat itself.\nPeople can and do make money based on technical analysis, and I am here\nto help prove it. \nIMPORTANCE OF A RULE-BASED APPROACH \nYou may have heard of Jesse Livermore, who was immortalized by Edwin\nLefèvre’s book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (G. H. Doran, 1923;\nWiley, 2006). Jesse was considered one of the greatest speculators of his\nday. Many of his principles and ideas are still used. His three key concepts\nof trading are (1) timing, (2) risk management, and (3) emotional control. \nThis quote from Richard Smitten’s Trade Like Jesse Livermore (Wiley,\n2005, p. 70) sticks with me because it is as true now as it ever was (keep in\nmind that Jesse committed suicide in 1940, so this was stated nearly 70\nyears ago): “All through time, people have basically acted the same way in\nthe stock and commodity markets as a result of greed, fear, ignorance, and\nhope: that is why the formations and patterns recur on a constant basis. The\npatterns the traders and technicians observe are simply the reflections of\nhuman emotional behavior.” \nMost traders who are consistently profitable have learned to develop a\nrule-based approach that doesn’t change. They have within their arsenal of\ntrading tools, definitive, recognizable, and frequently reoccurring patterns\nthat can be used to trade by a set of established trading rules. They can\nclearly define, without guessing or using a vague approach, support and re-\nsistance levels and what to do once prices reach those levels. Moreover,\nthey have the ability to clearly define their entry, stop-loss, or risk parame-\nters and their profit objectives in a consistent, repetitious fashion each time\nthey place a trade. This is what I do when trading my own account and what\nI have taught my son and even my own father. My dad used to think trading\ncommodities was like gambling until I showed him a method. This is the\nsame method that will be disclosed in these pages.\nIt is important for you to realize that it is the emotional balance that\nhelps keep you on the profitable side of the ledger. You must never anti-\ncipate what the market might do, but rather wait for confirmation on \nyour triggers. \nMost traders who are profitable are flexible as to the anticipated out-\ncome that may occur on each trade.

Remember that the business of trading \nfor a living requires that you establish some kind of structure in a market-\nplace with countless variables. Why not consider trading by a set of rules?\nMost traders do not trade by a system; the term “black box” just means \nthat a trader has input a set of trading parameters and automatically exe-\ncutes a trade based on a specific set of criteria—strict rules to automati-\ncally trade by. \nSTART TRADING AS A BUSINESS\nIf you are currently trading for a living or if you are expanding your knowl-\nedge to learn how to trade for a living, remember that this is a business. You\nneed to treat it like a business. Therefore, some considerations need to be\nmade, for example, forming a corporation in order to deduct such expenses\nas your computer equipment, quote feed, DSL (digital subscriber line), of-\nfice rent, travel to investment conferences, and continued education semi-\nnars. What matters most to every trader and investor is creating a positive\ncash flow. You wouldn’t want to finally start learning to make money con-\nsistently in the market and find out that you cannot take any expense de-\nductions. You should seek advice from a tax specialist so that you can take\nadvantage of all regular and necessary expenses as business deductions\nand save thousands of dollars each year.\nLet’s add up the examples I mentioned: Suppose your quote feed is\n$200 per month and your DSL is $40 per month. Renting a small one-room\noffice could run $500 to $700 per month. Then there are equipment ex-\npenses, such as your desktop computers, a laptop for travel, monitors and\nprinters and ink cartridges and general office supplies to purchase and up-\ngrade from time to time, say $2,000. Attending an investment conference\ncould mean $700 roundtrip airfare, plus $250 per night for hotel and meals.\nIf you have business entertaining expenses and went to at least two con-\nferences per year, you could be talking as little as $5,000 to as much as\n$25,000 in actual business expenses that can be deducted if you are running\ntrading as a business.\nIf you are a first-time smaller investor and decide that trading for a liv-\ning is something you have the financial resources, time, and emotional\nmakeup to do, what business plan do you have in place to protect the\nmoney you make in the market? Where will you put your profits as a short-\nterm trader? Some traders have had many problems with this issue; it is\nsimilar to the old expression of “Robbing Peter to pay Paul.” After all, who\nTrading Vehicles, Stock, ETFs, Futures, and Forex\n7\n",

It is vital to your success that you continue\nto learn not only about the market but also about your trading hardware or\ncomputer equipment. For example, if you trade off a laptop, you should\nknow how to disable the tapping feature on the touch pad. After all, who\nwants to accidentally place the wrong order on line? That has happened to\ntraders because the touch pad is ultrasensative. Simply moving your finger\nor having your shirt sleeve touch the pad can act as an action click. Traders\nshould know how to set up and troubleshoot office or home Internet con-\nnections or at least have a brokerage account that offers assistance in tak-\ning over-the-phone orders. \nTraders need to learn and comprehend all the features and benefits\nthat charting software packages offer and should know all about the order\nentry platforms and, more specifically, the brokerage firm rules and proce-\ndures for trading. Traders should make sure the brokerage firm has the\ntitle of the account set up so if ever there is a situation where you wish to\nwire money into an account, it matches the name on the bank to your trad-\ning account. You don’t want an important wire to be rejected. In a situation\nwhere you want to either put on more positions or add a second account to\ntrade a great opportunity, how sad it would be for back-office personnel to\nreject the wire, resulting in a lost opportunity. \nA great trader is always looking to learn. One of the best processes to\nlearn is asking a series of questions; evaluating the dynamics of a situation\nor event; and seeking out how to take advantage of that event within the fi-\nnancial resources, risk factors, and time constraints in place. \nThe traits that most professional and consistently profitable traders\n8\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

Winning traders ex-\nhibit the qualities of patience and discipline. The techniques that will be\ntaught in this book will help you master those two qualities.\nOther traits that winners possess are that they diversify into various\ntrading positions, while committing only 10 to 40 percent of accounts equity\nin the markets. Successful traders commit their full attention to the market\ntrends and prices, and they act on trading signals immediately. \nThey also seem to possess the ability to accept winners and embrace\nlosers, and they don’t let either of these outcomes generally influence their\nnext trade decision. They stay in the now and react to what the market is\ncurrently doing. Winning traders take breaks from trading. Through con-\ntinued education and the process of asking questions, they gain an edge and\nstay on top of their competition through diversification or other more ad-\nvanced trading strategies. \nTRADERS NEED TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS\nThe process of asking questions is what is needed in order to gain more\nknowledge. The trouble is, most traders do not have enough experience to\nknow what the right questions are. If you apply simple common sense,\nthen you will be on a great start to learn how to identify investing or trad-\ning opportunities and find the right strategy to take advantage of those \nopportunities. \nSome questions traders need to ask themselves include, just for\nstarters: How much time do I have to dedicate to the markets? If I enter a\nday trade, do I have the time to watch this position, or do I have an ap-\npointment or meeting scheduled for that day? What are the possible out-\ncomes of what I am about to do, based on what I have control over? \nFocus on what it is you want to achieve, write it out, and concentrate\non that goal. Think of the consequences or possible outcomes of your ac-\ntions so you will have a more balanced emotional reaction if the outcome\nis not as positive as you expected. Ask questions such as:\n• Do market conditions warrant increasing or decreasing my position\nsize?\n• Are there reports coming out that may impact the market or my posi-\ntion?\n• Are my entry and exit targets justified?\n• If the market is so bearish, why won’t it go down?\n• If the market is so bullish, why won’t it rally?\nTrading Vehicles, Stock, ETFs, Futures, and Forex\n9\n",

      "text": "Trading without asking questions or without probing leads to trading\nblindly or without a plan. It opens the door for destructive emotional inter-\nference. Another quote from Jesse Livermore helps confirm this: “There is\nnothing new on Wall Street or in stock speculation. What has happened in\nthe past will happen again and again and again. This is because human na-\nture does not change, and it is human emotion that always gets in the way\nof human intelligence. Of this I am sure.” (Smitten, Trade Like Jesse Liver-\nmore, p. 167)\nThat statement was made over 65 years ago and is without a doubt still\napplicable to this day. Do not let your emotions get in the way of your trad-\ning decisions. If you ask the right question before placing a trade, you stand\nto gain an edge on winning the emotional battle of trading. It is generally\nthose who are afraid of losing through fear itself who stand to lose because\nthat emotion will interfere with rational, well-thought-out trading plans.\nAsking yourself the right questions will help you to choose a more apro-\npriate investment vehicle or trading strategy. For example, ask yourself be-\nfore entering a trade: What are the time expectations for a result to occur?\nDo I have availability of time to see the trade through? Would short-term\nday trading or swing trading be possible if I have a regular day time job? In\nwhat time zone do I start work? This is relevant because a person living on\nthe West Coast could trade an early morning market such as the Chicago\nBoard of Trade (CBOT) bond contract opening session; however, a person\nwith an early morning job may want to consider foreign currency or forex\n(Foreign Exchange) trading on the European session starting at night.\nIn order to know what time demands you need, you should also ask\nyourself if you have the tolerance for trading a leveraged product and if \nyou have the tolerance for the risks: Should I use a time period stop—if the\nmarket does not move or react within a specified time period, should I exit\nthe position? Should I use a conditional stop, such as a “stop-close only”\norder? Does my order platform take such orders, or do I need to manually\nwatch and then implement such an order? (In intraday trading, the answer\nis yes, you need to manually watch the close of the time period you are trad-\ning in.) Can I afford to place a stop, say, 10 or 20 percent of my overall ac-\ncount value?\nYou need to be clear and honest with yourself when answering these\nevaluation questions. Remind yourself by asking: Why am I trading? What\nare my expectations? (I have met too many people that look at trading as an\neasy and quick way to make money or to replace their current career.)\nBased on your trading account size or your risk capital, ask: What returns\nwill I need in order to generate sufficient income? Is my starting equity size\nor bank roll inclusive of my living expenses? Are my expectations on that\nreturn realistic on a constant basis? \nThese questions are important because they will help you to determine\n10\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

How much to risk per trade is a concept that many novice traders fail\nto realize until it is way too late. They end up learning the exact wiring in-\nstructions on a regular basis to their brokerage account; the real hard cases\nend up remembering those instructions by heart. Once you learn and have\nthe confidence to trade a system or follow a trading plan with a set of con-\nditions and specific rules, you still need to have an effective method for risk\ncontrols. I would start by considering how much risk per trade I should use\nby looking at my overall account size, then at the market’s volatility and liq-\nuidity conditions, and then at a certain percentage of the overall account on\na percentage basis. Let me show you what I mean; and when we go over\nvarious stop types and methods later in the book, you will be able to better\ncomprehend my meaning. If a person wanting to start a day trading ac-\ncount begins with $10,000 and uses a 10 percent risk factor per trade based\non the overall beginning equity size, if the first five trades go bad, then he\nor she has lost 50 percent of the overall account. Therefore, it is imperative\nthat traders learn different techniques to protect their trading equity. In-\nvestors also need to know the number of positions with which they should\nstart in connection to the account size and the point at which they add on\nto their contract lot or position size. In Chapter 11, I will go over a method\nto help you determine answers to those questions. Then you will have a bet-\nter understanding of a proper ratio and the point at which you should start\nto increase your trading size.\nNUMBER ONE TRADING FOCUS—RISK MANAGEMENT\nAs most trading books will explain, risk management is the key to survival\nand what trading is really all about. While it may sound like a cliché, the\nhard truth is that consistently profitable trading, in my opinion, significantly\ndepends on proper risk taking and risk management combined. Winning\ntraders follow a tried-and-tested plan based on rules or on a defined set of\ncriteria. Winning traders recognize the importance of risk management and\nof money management.

But if you do not follow a set of rules, you increase\nthe odds of being 100 percent wrong in your trading. If you manage your\ntrading risks and execute promptly on the trade signal, then you increase\nthe odds that you will be successful. When trading, your mind can play\ntricks on you. You start to anticipate a buy signal only to act on a false sig-\nnal. You need to learn when and how an actual signal is generated and\nwhat and when you should trigger the action to initiate a trade. When you\nare trading market signals by a predefined set of rules and a set of criteria,\nthen the mind cannot play tricks on you. When a signal says buy, then buy;\nwhen a signal says sell, then sell. It’s that simple. Generally speaking, from\nmy experience, if a trader says, “I am tired of this,” and decides not to take\nthe signal, that ignored signal is the one that becomes a big winner. If you\nhave traded before, you may relate to that syndrome. For day traders in\nstock or stock index futures, this usually happens in the last hour of the\ntrading session!\nDIVERSIFICATION IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS\nThis observation was written by Peter L. Bernstein in his book Against the\nGods, The Remarkable Story of Risk (Wiley, 1996):\nAll of the tools we use today in risk management and in the analysis of\ndecisions, from the strict rationality of game theory to the challenges of\nchaos theory, stem from the mathematical developments that took\nplace between 1654 and 1760 with two exceptions: In 1875 Francis Gal-\nton, an amateur mathematician, discovered regression to the mean;\nand in 1952, Nobel Laureate Harry Markowitz, then a young graduate\nstudent at the University of Chicago, demonstrated mathematically\nwhy putting all your eggs in one basket is an unacceptably risky strat-\negy and why diversification is the nearest an investor or business\nmanager can ever come to a free lunch. That revelation touched off the\nintellectual movement that revolutionized Wall Street, corporate fi-\nnance, and business decisions around the world; its effects are still\nbeing felt today. (pp. 5–6)\nWith that notion came the concept of exploiting diversification by\nmeans of spreading investment and risk capital in various markets, such as\nstocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.

      "text": "In this book, I want to teach you what to search for when chart reading.\nI am not going to go into detail on every specific candlestick chart pattern\nbecause I generally only use them to help identify where the market closes\nin relationship to the open or the past price points, such as the high or low\npoints, rather than rely on them to signal a trade based on traditional chart\nformations.\nI believe that, like many things in life, the more you repeat positive ac-\ntions, the more you will experience and receive positive reactions. In trad-\ning, that translates to simply following rules, waiting for signals to\ntranspire, and then acting on those signals, rather than anticipating that sig-\nnals will form. When signals trigger a buy, then go long; when a signal trig-\ngers a sell, then exit the long or go short. As I stated earlier, following a set\nof rules will not guarantee that you will be 100 percent right in your trading\nresults; but by not following a set of rules, your chances increase that you\nmay be closer to 100 percent wrong in your trading results. One must learn\nto cut losses and let winning trades ride. It sounds like a cliché to trading\nveterans; but the fact is that it is so simple, yet it is so hard to do. By ac-\ncepting this process of learning some simple principles and then following\na few sets of rules, which I will go into in this book, you become a better\ntrader; and that may translate into becoming a more profitable trader.\nOne trait I have noticed that most novice traders possess is that they\ntry to overanalyze and overcomplicate matters. In order to help simplify\nyour thinking, remember this: There are only four common denominators\nthat each of us has equal access to—the open, the high, the low, and the\nclose of any given market, in any given time frame. There are two other val-\nues to measure: volume and, for futures traders, open interest. However,\neven these two elements cannot be finalized or completely calculated until\nthe close of each trading session. Therefore, it is important that you realize\nthat the close is the single most important aspect when using and applying\nall forms of technical analysis studies. \nSo no matter what market or trading vehicle you are trading—whether\nit is a stock, a futures or commodity market, a stock index, the forex cur-\nrency markets, or even an exchange traded fund, you need to watch the\nclose of the time period in which you are trading to capture a clue in order\nto initiate a trade, manage the trade, and learn the right exit spot. Always re-\nmember that the close is the most important element and what matters\nmost to focus on when trading. It is the relationship of the close to past\nprice action and to the high, the low, and the open that will help measure or\nweigh a value of a given market at any given time. Therefore, you can get a\nmore accurate gauge of what to do. In trading terms, the choices you have\nare to buy, to sell, to spread off, or to do nothing and hold onto your cash.\nSometimes not knowing what to do translates into not entering a position.\nRemember that being in cash or standing on the sidelines is a trade, too.\n14\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

      "text": "Once you grasp the understanding that it is the close that shows you\nwhat the current market value is, then you should have a clue as what your\nnext trading decision should be. If you learn to act on the close for your\ntrading decisions and on triggers, that information will help stack the odds\nin your favor that you are going with the current flow or in the right market\ndirection. That includes any time period for which you are trading. That\nmeans if you are a day trader using a 5-minute period, you cannot act on an\nintratime period signal. You need to wait for the five-minute period to con-\nclude before acting on a trigger. The same goes for a 5-minute, a 60-minute,\na daily, a weekly, or even a monthly time period.\nThe clues for which we as traders are looking are what we need to ini-\ntiate a trading decision and are what I define as a trading trigger, which will\nbe explained later in the book. Once you understand how markets work,\nunderstand simple charting techniques, and have a fundamental working\nknowledge of indicators and what dictates increases or decreases in values\nof a given product at a given time (such as supply and demand factors) and\nhow that is represented on a chart, then you will have gained a better edge\nin the market and will have stacked the odds of success in your favor. \nThere is one flaw in any system, and it is generally from the execution\nside rather than from the construction side of the system. To be specific,\nmost traders who lose while trading a system fail to trade by the signals\ngenerated by that system. Either they fail to act once the signal is gener-\nated, or they anticipate that a signal will be generated thus acting on a\nfalse signal. \nIt is imperative that once you read this book you learn that you must\nwait for the actual signal to trigger, and that occurs in most cases by the\nclose of the time period in which you are trading. Even when a system gen-\nerates a losing trade, it will signal a trigger to get out. You must act on con-\nfirmed signals rather than on anticipation of those signals or, more\nimportant, on your personal hunches.\nOnce you have a working knowledge of the markets and the confidence\nin what the possible outcome of those triggers might be, working with a few\nsetups and signals will allow you to find a trading opportunity; and then you\nwill be able to apply the appropriate strategy. You can diversify trading\nstyles, such as integrating a day trade into a position trade, utilizing an op-\ntion strategy, or applying the information on various trading vehicles. \nI talked about this concept of “finding opportunity, then applying a\nstrategy” in my first book: I called it playing the Monte Hall game, Let’s\nMake a Deal. Look behind door number one, and review the risk rewards;\nthen look at the strategy behind door number two, and review the risk and\nrewards there; and then finally open door number three, and see if that\nstrategy appeals to your analysis of risk and rewards.

Some are slightly\nmore complex than others, and some offer increased leverage, such as fu-\ntures and even forex currency markets. Some have short life spans due to\nexpirations, such as an option or a futures contract. A trader or an investor\nneeds to examine his or her personality profiles, tolerance for risk, personal\ntime availability to devote to trading, and the time objective or turnover for\nachieving specific profit objectives. Once those are determined, then he or\nshe needs to choose the right trading vehicle or a mixture of asset classes\nin order to apply a trading strategy. \nTherefore, it is important to have several different types of trading ac-\ncounts for taking advantage of various investment products and levels of\nrisk, such as long-term retirement versus short-term speculative trading op-\nportunities. A stock account will allow you to trade stocks, stock options,\nmutual funds, and ETFs.\nA futures account will allow you to take advantage of the many oppor-\ntunities of various commodity markets and options, in addition to day and\nswing trading the highly liquid stock index futures markets such as the\nDow, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Russell 2000, and Nasdaq 100 contracts.\nSome futures brokerage firms even have access for spot foreign currency\ntrading on their trading platforms.

But at age 71, he\nstarted gaining an interest in what I was doing, especially as he saw the\nfruits of my labors. More important, he witnessed the trading successes my\nson was also achieving and started to see that the pattern of what I was\ndoing was teachable. In 2002, I had my son start a retirement stock account\nwith what I call a core position of select stocks. One such stock was Gen-\neral Electric, which he purchased at 24.60; another stock I had him pur-\nchase was Rambus at 5.62. In both cases, he made out extremely well. In\nfact, if you know stocks, you may recognize that those prices were darn\nclose to the exact lows in 2003. Let me tell you it was not by chance or luck\nthat I had picked those prices; it was by using the methods I am going to de-\nscribe in this book.\n16\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

My son is\nself-employed; he owns cellular phone stores and sells satellite dish sys-\ntems. He keeps the television on in his stores to show customers the satel-\nlite systems. After watching my appearance on CNBC, he left the television\non; later that day, he started listening to Mad Money—the Jim Crammer\nshow. Anyway, my son started trading his own stock account. \nHe called me one day to ask my opinion on a particular stock. That’s\nwhen I found out what he was up to. Now, my son is pretty smart; but there\nwere several things he was not familiar with, for instance, what a stop-loss\norder was. As you might imagine, I was insanely furious with him for not\nknowing important yet basic concepts of trading. After I got through yelling\nat him, his mom (my wife) got hold of him; after that conversation, one of\nmy trading courses was shipped out FedEx, and he quickly studied. He got\nback on the right track, gained an interest, and learned how to trade by my\nset of rules and by looking for such trading patterns as a high close doji\n(HCD) buy signal and a low close doji (LCD) sell signal. Both of these spe-\ncific setups and triggers are covered in this book. The next course of action\nwas to get him set up with the right markets to day trade and to open the\nright brokerage account to meet his needs for both his short- and long-term\nobjectives. Now this is what I taught my son, and he has been consistently\nimproving in his trading ever since. That is what my Dad saw, and he found\nmerit in my methods. Therefore, I hope this solidifies your belief that\ntraders can and do make money trading in the markets. Just find the right\nmethods with which you are comfortable, stick to the trading rules (such as\nwaiting for the triggers, rather than anticipating and acting prematurely),\nfind and investment strategy (such as day, swing, or position trading), and\nthen get confident that you are applying the right strategy with the right\nproduct (whether it is stocks, futures, options, foreign currencies, or forex\nmarkets). You have the potential to become a successful trader once you\nhave these conditions mastered. The next process is finding the right soft-\nware product and brokerage firm. \nI have been in the industry for over a quarter of a century, so I know\nwhat to look for in both trading firm and software that suit my needs. I have\nthe experience to know that not all trading companies are equal. The plain\ntruth about it is that some companies are just better than others. Remem-\nber the debacle of REFCO? These guys were a behemoth in the futures and\nspot foreign currency trading business. They had a ton of talented people,\nsome who are ex-employees of mine and some who I consider friends. I\nnever did trade through them. Mainly, I was happy elsewhere. But as the\nyears passed, REFCO just became too big. I like personalized service, and\nI don’t need a company to provide me with daily research.

      "text": "are looking for one company to outperform the competitor, so you\nneed to know as much as possible about that business. \nTrading decisions and correct stock selection involve more than look-\ning at a chart and a few technical indicators. I believe it helps to look a lit-\ntle deeper in expected earnings forecasts and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios\nto see if the stock is expensive or cheap relative to current prices. Calcu-\nlating P/E ratios is an easy concept; for example, if a stock is trading at $40\nper share and has an earnings of $4 per share, the P/E ratio would be the\nprice of the stock divided by the earnings—$40/$4, or 10 times earnings.\nSPREAD TRADING TIPS\nIf you decide to take advantage of a spread trade, you should realize that it\nis a risky business. You could be on the wrong side of both markets. Since\nspreading involves selling short one stock and simultaneously buying an-\nother stock, if the price goes in the opposite direction of both trades, you\ncan lose on both sides of the trade. Selling short is a hard concept for many\ntraders, both novice and experienced, to grasp. Believe it or not, there are\nsome folks who are not aware that you can sell first without owning the se-\ncurity. Short selling means you are betting that the price of a given product\nwill decline; therefore, you would be selling first without owning the un-\nderlying product with the hopes of buying back later at a lower price. Sell-\ning short is considered highly speculative for stock traders; the process\ninvolves “borrowing” the stock from the brokerage firm, if the firm has that\nsecurity in inventory. Shorting stock is very similar and should not scare in-\nvestors. It is a very simple concept; in fact, it is just the opposite for longs.\nYou want to buy low and then sell out later at a higher price. With shorting,\nyou are selling first and buying back later, hopefully at a lower price to gen-\nerate a profit. \nThere are certain restrictions; for one, you need to set up a margin ac-\ncount with your brokerage firm. Another restriction carries potential exe-\ncution risks: Due to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nregulations, there is what is known as the “uptick” rule. The uptick rule was\nestablished in the 1930s to prevent a bear market raid on a stock. In order\nto execute a trade, the stock needs to trade at a price higher than the pre-\nceding transaction price in the same security. For example, if you wanted\nto enter a spread by selling Dell Inc. and buying Apple, you would have\nbeen anticipating or looking for Apple to outperform Dell’s price gains. Or\nif both stock prices decline, you would want Dell to decline more than\nApple. But in order to effectively execute that strategy, you would want to\n24\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

Let’s say you\nenter the long side first without confirmation that you were filled on the\nshort side; if the market on the position you hold—the long side—goes\ndown and if both markets moved in tandem, you would need an uptick on\nthe short side in order to be in the spread. Imagine if you went long first and\nthe stock dropped. Then when you are finally able to execute the short\nside, the market has plunged. That would translate into an actual loss. So if\nyou do not get filled first on the short side, the worst that can happen is that\nyou lose a trading opportunity. This is a great example of why traders have\nthe obligation of knowing all there is about the market they trade in. As you\ncan see in Figure 1.6, Dell has moved in the same direction as Apple, but\nApple has outperformed as a price leader.

These are all the qualities to look for\nwhen selecting a long-term purchase.\nBECOME THE NEXT WARREN BUFFETT\nI believe that stocks should be traded as an investment, but there are many\nways to capture a profit. I must say for all investors and for every trader,\nyou can start your own mutual fund. It requires discipline not only to open\na stock account but also to fund it and add to it every month. If you are a\nnew investor, just reading this book to see if trading for a living is for you,\nit is imperative that you start somewhere and start with a select stock ac-\ncount first. The discipline is that you should add money in the account\nevery month, like you are paying a bill. If you are under 30, consider it your\nretirement. You are paying your bills in the future now. That is some of the\nbest advice anyone gave me, and I think it is worthy of passing on to you.\nOnce you gain more experience, you can separate long-term investing from\nshort-term speculative trading, which is one form of diversification. After\nall, you may see a long period of flat performance in one of your core hold-\nings. Short-term day trading, if you have the time and resources, can be a re-\nwarding experience. Imagine owning Wal-Mart and for literally seven years\nexperiencing a loss to a flat performance. Figure 1.10 illustrates the mar-\nket’s sideways move in one of the world’s biggest retail stores.\nIf you are considering supplementing your investment techniques, one\nof the many drawbacks of trading stocks for a short-term day trader with a\nsmall trading account is that you are limited to how many trades you can\nmake, especially if your account is less than $25,000 and you are not signed\nup for a margin account. In that case, you are limited to five round-trip buy-\nand-sell trades per week due to SEC rules. So short-term trading would not\nbe a good consideration for stocks. That is where trading stock index fu-\ntures and forex markets takes over, as I will explain in the following pages.\nThere is one high-risk, high-reward method of trading stocks that I have\nnot covered yet: getting in on an initial public offering (IPO) stock. Those\ninvestors lucky enough to get in on an IPO like Google (goog), the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange (CME), or even the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT—\nstock, BOT) were able to double, triple, quadruple, or even better, their ini-\ntial investment dollars.\nThe Chicago Board of Trade has been around for over 155 years, and I\nimagine it will likely continue to be around for another 155 years, with lit-\ntle competition in products traded on its exchange and with the increase in\npopularity on the electronics metals products, such as gold and silver, plus\nTrading Vehicles, Stock, ETFs, Futures, and Forex\n29\n",

Figure 1.11 shows that the price exploded to nearly as\nhigh as 134 but has managed to trade back as low as 86 as of this writing.\nThe BOT stock illustrates that not all IPOs are guaranteed moneymakers; in\nfact, depending on your entry, these offerings can be hazardous to your fi-\nnancial well-being. The phrase “invest wisely” means “not putting all your\neggs in one basket.” Find out which is the sector leader, and go with that\nstock, unless you like the underdog.

Choosing this kind of product allows an in-\nvestor to select the right sector of performance, rather than pinpointing an\nindividual stock. The benefits of trading ETFs compared to a mutual fund\nare enormous: They allow diversification; they incur more effective trans-\naction costs; there is pricing transparency; and they are tax efficient. After\nall, it is almost impossible for an individual trader with limited trading re-\nsources to effectively track and trade every stock in all sectors of the mar-\nket.

The advantage here\nis that the trader can mix the benefits of applying technical analysis and\nfundamental analysis to a combination of stock and index trading. \nIn the most recent development, ETFs have started to include products\nrelated to commodities such as crude oil, gold, and silver; but also they\nhave expanded into the forex arena by launching a euro currency product.\nTrading Vehicles, Stock, ETFs, Futures, and Forex\n33\nFIGURE 1.13\nRealTick graphics used with permission of Townsend Analytics, LTD.\n",

      "text": "Personalized Mini-Mutual Fund\nInstead of agonizing over which stock will outperform in a certain sector,\nyou can use ETFs as an investment vehicle that has certain stocks in a bas-\nket as one unit, listed as a sector fund. This allows individual investors to\ninvest in a group of stocks in a sector, rather than relying on a mutual fund\nto do it for them. Moreover, many mutual funds charge management fees\nand at times do not fully invest all an investor’s cash in the market. Because\nETFs trade like a stock, the price of which fluctuates daily, an ETF does not\nhave its net asset value (NAV) calculated every day like a mutual fund. By\nowning an ETF, you get the diversification of an index fund plus the ability\nto sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as little as one share. \nAnother advantage of an ETF is that the expense ratios for most ETFs\nare lower than that of the average mutual fund. When buying and selling\nETFs, you have to pay the same commission to your broker that you’d pay\non any regular order. ETFs allow you to sell without the uptick rule, so you\ncan short right away, even after the market is in a strong downtrend. You do\nnot have to wait until the close of the day settlement price as happens in a\nmutual fund. Another benefit is the tax consequences because of shielding\nfrom capital gains due to the fact that ETFs do not change holding like a\nmutual fund does. So purchasing shares of ETFs is a viable alternative to\ninvesting in mutual funds for individual investors. Keep in mind that many\nof the ETFs available today have access to trading options around the ETF.\nTherefore, you can develop simple or more complex hedge or spreading\nstrategies tied around an ETF. There are some negatives, such as the three-\nday settlement restriction and a bid/ask spread just like any other market;\nbut the benefits certainly outweigh the negatives, especially for longer-term\nswing and position traders.\nThe Birth of ETFs\nThe original ETF was offered to the investing public back in 1993 by the\nAmerican Stock Exchange (go to www.amex.com for more listings) and\nwas known as the SPDRs, which stands for Standard & Poor’s Depositary\nReceipts and corresponds with the price movements of the Standard &\nPoor’s 500. \nThe more actively traded and by far more popular ETF came with the\nQQQs, which directly correspond with the Nasdaq 100. Then there are the\nDiamonds, which move in correlation to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nETFs have since expanded, and there is now a new breed of investment ve-\nhicles to capture opportunities in sectors known as HOLDRs. These trading\nvehicles are based on certain stocks in a certain sector, known as a basket\nof diversified stocks in a specific sector. \n34\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

It is also appealing to those who want longer-term trades and who\nhold a regular day job and cannot day trade for a living, at least not yet.\nOnce again, the difficulty of choosing the right stock in a competitive\nindustry in a specific sector can be overcome; and it may be more profitable\nby considering trading an ETF. The previous comparisons of Best Buy and\nCircuit City, Dell and Apple, and AMD and Intel all are excellent examples\nof how an investor may have a difficult time anticipating which stock out-\nperforms another in a specific sector. Therefore, for a longer-term stock\ntrader, ETF investment vehicles could be a solution, helping to boost the\nbottom line, and can be added to his or her investment portfolio.\nETFs and some HOLDRs have the greater advantage of trading put and\ncall options within a prescribed period of time. An investor can even buy\ncalls such as on the pharmaceutical HOLDRs. Here is a tactic that I have\nused before with some success, especially if there are buy signals on sev-\neral individual stocks within a sector. Go ahead and purchase, with a rea-\nsonable time until expiration, an in-the-money or close-to-the-money call\noption on the HOLDR itself. The pharmaceutical HOLDRs can be traded\nbased on signals from Abbott, Merck, and Pfizer.\nSo you can utilize ETFs and their respected relatives and apply several\nstrategies; also you can use intermarket relationships to determine buy or\nsell signals and devise a trading strategy dependent on those signals. Once\nyou have a good feel for a stock that correlates or links best with an \nETF, then you can use a spread or “pairs” trading strategy or even a hedge\nstrategy using options. Deciding what is best for your risk capital making,\nusing an ETF, you no longer need to make a precise pick for a stock in a\nspecific sector. \nIn conclusion, trading opportunities exist in these investment vehicles\nfor all investors; and best of all, they respond quite well using technical\nanalysis to project support and resistance levels as derived from pivot point\nanalysis and the momentum techniques that certain candle patterns indi-\ncate, which are the specific techniques disclosed in this book.

So now a trader needs to know which exchange\nthe product is traded on, how much risk capital is needed to invest per con-\ntract, and how much each point value is. Let’s look at the New York Mer-\ncantile Exchange’s crude oil contract: The contract size is 1,000 gallons;\nevery tick or point fluctuation equals $10. A $1 move per contract is a $1,000\nprice move. When prices were at $65 per barrel, the contract value was\n$65,000. The margin requirement was, at one point, nearly $9,000 per con-\ntract, almost 14 percent of the overall market value. The extremely high\nmargin requirement reflected the extreme level of volatility and the inher-\nent risk associated with that increased volatility. \nThe futures markets also have a value for stock traders to make deci-\nsions on asset allocations to their stock portfolios. In the agriculture sector,\nfor example, you can study the price direction of soybeans, use traditional\ntechnical analysis tactics to determine the strength of a trend, and see if\ncorresponding stocks linked to that market are worth switching or allocat-\ning funds toward. In Figure 1.27, we see soybeans making a seasonal har-\nvest bottom at the end of November.\nAnother advantage futures have is that you can trade signals to diver-\nsify in other investments. Anticipating that the market may establish a sea-\nsonal bottom, you may want to explore stocks directly linked to the\nagriculture industry, instead of being exposed to potential risks due to what\nmight appear to be an overleveraged investment vehicle, such as a futures\ncontract. After all, every penny in soybean futures was $50 at the time that\nI was preparing this book, and the minimum margin requirement was\n$1,148. That means that on a small 20 cent move, you could lose nearly 95\npercent of the initial investment per contract. \nThere are other considerations you could use, such as an options strat-\negy, to effectively reduce risk exposure, such as going long a futures con-\ntract and buying a put option for protection; but in this strategy, you need\nto time the right option expiration. An alternative strategy would be going\nlong a related market, such as stock in Monsanto shown in Figure 1.28.\nNotice that this stock exploded in early November. The best part here\nis that there were seasonal factors to support a buy signal; and the techni-\ncal picture shows what I call a “high close doji trigger,” which we will dis-\nclose in this book. In fact, this is a great example to demonstrate why using\na like or related market analysis approach can help you achieve better re-\nsults in your trading. Cycle and seasonal studies can really help you in se-\nlecting stocks. The futures markets can certainly aid in that analytical\nprocess. Not only do commodities move in cycles, but the economy and\nbusinesses do as well. \nThere is one man who sticks out above the rest as the premier expert\nin the field of intermarket relationships—John J.

Again, price increases in commodities his-\ntorically signal a rise in inflationary pressures.\nInvestors and traders can use stocks or ETFs to capitalize on com-\nmodity plays; but at times, it pays to diversify and have a commodity ac-\ncount. Not all stocks offer participation in all commodity moves, so it is\nwise to explore using commodity markets as an investment.\nA Case in Point\nA fundamental event, besides an increase in demand, that helped create a\nshortage of supplies in energy and other commodities in 2005 was the\nweather. Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma gave a lift to sugar and orange\njuice futures while harming certified coffee facilities in New Orleans and, to\na lesser extent, Miami. These weather-related events were pure commodity\nmarket plays. Let me walk you through one of these 2005 events: The day\nbefore Hurricane Wilma passed through Florida, my wife and I had watched\nthe Weather Channel intensely and decided to stick around because all the\nnews reported that the hurricane would be downgraded to a tropical de-\npression by the time it crossed over Naples and exited on the other side of\nFlorida, in Palm Beach. The day before, we had played golf; and it was a\nsplendid day: 83 degrees or so, a light breeze, and not a cloud in the sky. We\nwere planning to leave for Chicago the following Sunday, and we could\nhave easily changed our tickets and left early. Well, at 6 A.M. on October 24,\nwe woke up and discovered that Wilma had gained strength and merged\nwith another storm, named Alpha; and Wilma had turned into a low-grade\nCategory 3 hurricane! All I could think of at the moment my wife turned the\nTV on was, “I better make some coffee because we are going to lose\npower.” By the time the coffee had finished brewing, click, all the lights\nwent out. \nHowever, we were prepared: The cars had gas, the shutters were up,\nand we had a generator; so life was not so bad for that week. The morning\nof the hurricane, CNBC had called to see if I was in Florida and asked me\nwhat I thought would happen to the orange juice crop. I did a live inter-\nview via my cell phone, reporting on the weather conditions and what\nmight happen to the orange crop. I stated that “we could see at least a 10\npercent price gain from the 1.11 level to possibly as high as 1.25, as the\nstorm would pass through sections of Indian River County.” It was also\nthat storm that devastated the soon-to-be-harvested sugar cane crop. As it\nturns out, that was a solid prediction and exactly what played out in the\nmarkets. If you had a commodity account, you may have taken up that op-\nportunity in orange juice. In fact, orange juice eventually moved as high as\n164 by May 11, 2006.\nTrading Vehicles, Stock, ETFs, Futures, and Forex\n53\n",

Here is how that line applies to the hurricane situation. The\norange juice crop was slightly damaged; there was a reduction in supplies\nin the southern growing region in Florida. Prior to the hurricane, prices\nmoved higher in anticipation of a loss of inventory; what was unknown was\nhow much higher. The market traded higher after what appeared to be a\nsignificant damaging hurricane. \nFundamentally, the market was vulnerable for any further price\nshocks.

The fundamental supply/demand report outlook, as shown in the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) monthly crop report, did not re-\nveal a major supply/demand imbalance to warrant higher prices. But a frost\nscare would! The anticipation that crops would suffer from frost damage\npropped prices sharply higher. The point is that you need to be aware of\nwhat fundamental factors influence a market. Markets do not always move\nwhen they should on facts presented, but there are circumstances that can\nand do make markets move! A hurricane in South Florida before harvest\ntime is one such situation.\nNOT ALL NEWS AFFECTS MARKETS EQUALLY\nHurricane-related damage in 2005 played a major role in the reduction of\nsupplies to the sugar market more so than it did in orange juice. Also, the\nfundamental backdrop of the sugar market was more significant than the\norange juice market because it has a dual role: Sugar is a food product, and\nit is used as a biofuel to make methanol. It set record price gains in 2005, es-\npecially as energy prices surged. Raw sugar prices more than doubled in\n2005, climbing and making new 24-year highs. Brazil, the world’s largest\nproducer, uses most of its crop to make fuel because of the high cost of\ngasoline. With that information, we would expect that after Hurricanes Ka-\ntrina and Rita impacting the Louisiana crops and then Hurricane Wilma\nmaking a direct hit on Florida’s crop, prices would take off like a rocket!\nBut don’t forget that sugar is produced all over the world and that there are\nsugar beets and sugar cane. It is almost impossible to measure inventories\nfrom all growing regions of the world, and the market knew that after Hur-\nricane Wilma hit. The fundamental event that impacted the orange juice\nmarket had a different effect there than it did on the sugar market.\nAs you examine Figure 1.33, notice that prices actually decline after\nHurricane Wilma. It took almost one month for the market to realize that\nthere was a significant loss in Florida’s crop, and speculative money pored\ninto the market to take advantage of higher prices. A Trend Traders tech-\nnical price break signals to get long this market, and substantial profits were\nmade. It may appear that the fundamental and technical outlooks were not\nin sync; and by late January/early February of 2006, traders started to sense\nthat the market was getting slightly ahead of itself, or overbought. Traders\nwho were long started to liquidate some positions in preparation for the\nUSDA’s monthly crop report. If you look closely at Figure 1.33, the very\nhigh of the market was formed by a candle pattern named a shooting star.\n(Chapter 7 focuses on how to spot reversals like this one.)

There were many issues—mainly\npolitical, geopolitical, and economic developments—that influenced the\ndollar’s value. For starters, many U.S.–based multi-conflomerate corpora-\ntions were prompted to bring money back into the United States due to the\nHomeland Investment Act (HIA). The HIA is part of 2004 American Jobs\nCreation Act and was intended to encourage U.S.–based companies to\nbring money back home. \nThe window of opportunity afforded by the HIA prompted companies\nto increase the pace at which funds are repatriated to the United States.\nSince companies had only until the end of 2005, many analysts suspected\nthat companies would rush to repatriate foreign profits by year’s end and\nthat there would be a high dollar demand to convert foreign currencies.\nDon’t forget, during the middle of 2005, there were riots in France. That\ncontributed to poor market sentiment toward the euro zone, thus giving\nground for a flight to safety, and helped foreign investors switch to buying\nU.S. dollars. The tone was essentially dollar-positive and euro-negative,\nwhich is indicative of politics having a negative effect on the euro. Mean-\nwhile, the broader market was also most likely influenced by the high-pro-\nfile move by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.’s, Warren Buffett to cut back\nspeculative positions against the U.S. dollar after losing big on it due to sur-\nprising dollar strength. \nMr. Buffett had bet that the dollar would continue losing ground, as it\nTrading Vehicles, Stock, ETFs, Futures, and Forex\n61\n",

All of these tools and\norder-entry platforms come at no additional charge to the trader. \nThese features may sound too good to be true. With all the benefits\nthat the forex market offers, most newcomers want to know what the\ncatch is. There are some slight cost factors that relate to execution; \nyou pay a premium or a higher spread to buy and a higher spread to \nsell. Also, most forex companies take the other side of your trade; you \ndo not have direct access to the interbank market, as it is called. Since \nthe forex market is decentralized, it is possible that five different compa-\nnies are showing five different prices all at the same time within a few\npoints (PIPs—percentage in points). Since most forex traders are short-\nterm in nature, meaning they are quick in-and-out players, day trading \nin the forex markets is beneficial for these traders due to the fact that\nthere are no commissions; but the PIP spreads can and do add up. There\nlies the catch. \nBuy and Sell the Spread\nForex prices, or quotes, include a “bid” and an “ask” similar to other finan-\ncial products. The bid is the price at which a dealer is willing to buy and a\ntrader can sell a currency; and the ask is the price at which a dealer is will-\ning to sell and a trader can buy a currency. In forex trading, unlike futures\nor equities, you have to pay a percentage in price (PIP) spread on entering\na trade. The PIP spread is the point difference between the bid and the ask-\ning price of the spot currency price. This can vary between two and four\nPIPs on a euro versus U.S. dollar spread. The spread varies on other cur-\nrency pairs and is usually wider on more exotic cross markets, such as the\nCanadian dollar versus the Swiss franc.\nIf you want to hold a position for several days, a rollover process is\nnecessary. In the spot forex market, all trades must be settled within two\nbusiness days at the close of business at 5 P.M. (EST). The only fee in-\nvolved here is the interest payment on the position of currency held. At\ntimes, depending on the position, a trader can receive an interest payment\nas well. This is where the term tomorrow/next (Tom/Next) applies. It\nrefers to the simultaneous buying and selling of a currency for delivery the\nfollowing day. \nAs with futures, forex markets are now regulated to an extent and\ncome under the scrutiny of the self-imposed regulators, such as the Na-\ntional Futures Association after the CFTC Modernization Act passed in\n2002; but since there is no centralized marketplace, many forex dealers can\nand do make their own markets, as discussed earlier. \n64\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

      "text": "Why Trade Spot Forex Markets?\nOf all financial instruments traded, forex is believed by many professional\ntraders and analysts to be one of the best-suited markets to trade based off\ntechnical analysis methods, for a number of reasons. First is its sheer size\nin trading volume: According to the Bank for International Settlements, av-\nerage daily turnover in traditional foreign exchange markets amounted to\n$1.9 trillion in the cash exchange market and another $1.2 trillion per day in\nthe over-the-counter (OTC) foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives\nmarket as of April 2005. Second, the rate of growth and the number of mar-\nket participants in forex trading have grown some 2,000 percent over the\npast three decades, rising from barely $1 billion per day in 1974 to an esti-\nmated $2 trillion by 2005. Third, since the market does not have an official\nclosing time, there is never a backlog or “pool” of client orders parked\novernight that may cause a severe reaction to news stories hitting the mar-\nket at the U.S. Bank opening. This generally reduces the chance for price\ngaps. Currencies tend to experience longer-lasting trending market condi-\ntions than other markets. These trends can last for months or even years, as\nmost central banks do not switch interest rate policies every other day.\nThis makes them ideal markets for trend trading and even breakout sys-\ntems traders. This might explain why chart pattern analysis works so well\nin forex trading. With such widespread groups playing the game around the\nworld, crowd behavior plays a large part in currency moves; and it is this\ncrowd behavior that is the foundation for the myriad of technical analysis\ntools and techniques. \nDue in part to its size, forex is less volatile than other markets. Lower\nvolatility equals lower risk. For example, the S&P 500 Index trading range\nis between 4 percent and 5 percent daily, while the daily volatility range in\nthe euro is around 1 percent.\nTrading veterans know that markets are interdependent, with some\nmarkets more heavily influenced by certain markets than others. We cov-\nered some of these relationships looking at futures and certain stocks and\nhow changes in interest rates can move equity markets as well as the cur-\nrencies markets. We will learn in coming chapters how to detect hidden yet\nrepeating patterns that occur between these related markets and how forex\ntraders can profit from these patterns.\nWhich Is Bigger—Stocks or Forex?\nForex is by far the largest market in dollar volume, is less volatile, experi-\nences longer and more accentuated price trends, and does not have trading\ncommissions.

The\nbetter these fundamental and technical tools, the greater is their chance for\ntrading success. While intermarket and other relationships are often com-\nplex and difficult to apply effectively, with a little high-tech help, traders\nand investors can enjoy the benefits of using them without having to scrap\ntheir existing trading methods. \nForex versus Futures\nThe futures market through the International Monetary Market (IMM) of\nthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange has many benefits as well. Some believe\nthere are tighter spreads between the bid and the asking price, plus there is\nno interest charge or rollover fee every other day. In addition, the futures\nmarkets offer options for longer-term traders. There are transactions costs\nthat apply per round turn; but if the brokerage commission exchange, reg-\nulatory, and transaction charges are less than the PIP spread in forex, an\nactive speculator would be given a better cost advantage by using the fu-\ntures markets instead of the forex spot markets. \nLet’s compare a trade in forex to a trade with a similar-size contract\nvalue on the futures exchange, using the example of a euro futures contract\non the CME, where it has a contract size of USD 125,000 worth of euros,\nwhere each PIP would be 12.50 in value. If the commissions and related\nfees are on a par with most discount brokerage firms, $20 is your transac-\ntion cost per round turn, that is, $10 to buy and $10 to sell out the position.\nKeep in mind that the contract value is 25 percent higher than a full-\nsize forex position, too. If a day trader in forex does a $100,000 full-lot-size\ncontract and pays three PIPS on every transaction for both the entry and\nthe exit of each position, this trader would be charged $30 per round-turn\ntransaction. \nThe futures arena also has other interesting features and products; one\nis the U.S. dollar Index® contract traded on the New York Board of Trade,\nas was shown in Figure 1.34. That index is computed using a trade-\nweighted geometric average of six currencies. It virtually trades around the\nclock—the trading hours are from 7 P.M. to 10 P.M., then from 3 A.M. to 8:05\nA.M., and then from 8:05 A.M. to 3 P.M. Unlike the forex, there are daily lim-\nits on the price movement with 200 ticks above and below the prior day’s\nsettlement, except during the last 30 minutes of any trading session, when\nno limit applies. Should the price reach the limit and remain within 100\nticks of the limit for 15 minutes, then new limits will be established 200\nticks above and below the previous price limit. Figure 1.35 shows a break-\ndown of the various currencies and their respective weights on the average.\nThe top four include the euro, which is the heaviest weight at 57.6 percent,\n66\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

      "text": "foreign currency markets trade on quarterly expirations—the March, June,\nSeptember, and December contract months. The volume will represent the\ntotal for all the trades in each contract month. Most technical analysts be-\nlieve that volume is an indicator of the strength of a market trend. It is also\na relative measure of the dominant behavior of the market. A further ex-\nplanation is that volume is the measurement of the market’s acceptance or\nrejection of price at a specific level and time. There are several theories and\nso-called rules when using volume analysis on price charts: First, if a mar-\nket is increasing in price and the volume is increasing, the market is said to\nbe in a bullish mode and can indicate further price increases. Second, the\nexact opposite is true for a declining market. If price is declining and vol-\nume increases, it is said to be in a bearish mode and indicates further price\ndecreases. However, if a substantial daily market price increase or de-\ncrease occurs after a long steady uptrend or downtrend, especially on un-\nusually high daily volume, the move is considered to be a “blow-off-top or\nbottom exhaustion” and can signal a market turning point or a trend rever-\nsal. Here are some guidelines to use when using volume analysis.\n• Increasing volume in a rising price environment signals excessive\nbuying pressure and could lead to substantial advances. \n• Increasing volume while prices are falling may signal a bear move. \n• Decreasing volume while prices are climbing may indicate a plateau\nand can be used to predict a reversal. \n• Decreasing volume with a weaker price environment shows that\nfresh sellers are reluctant to enter the market and could be a sign of a\nfuture downtrend. \n• Excessive volume while prices are high indicates that traders are sell-\ning into strength and often creates a price ceiling.\n• Excessively low volume while prices are low indicates that traders are\nbuying on weakness and often creates a floor. \nOpen interest reveals the total amount of open positions that are out-\nstanding in existence and not offset or delivered upon. Remember that in\nfutures trading, this is a zero-sum game so that for every long there is a\nshort or for every buyer there is a seller. The open interest figure represents\nthe longs or shorts but not the total of both. So when examining open in-\nterest, the theory or general guidelines are that when prices rise and open\ninterest increases, this reveals that more new longs have entered the mar-\nket and more new money is flowing into the market. This reflects why the\nprice increases. Of course, the exact opposite is true on a declining market.\nChartists combine both the price movement and the data from volume and\nopen interest to evaluate the “condition” of the market. If there is a price\nincrease on strong volume and open interest increases, then this is a signal\n68\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

It is the Weekly Com-\nmodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitment of Traders (COT)\nreport.

      "text": "there are several categories. The first is the “non-commercial”—all large\nprofessional traders or entities, such as a hedge fund, a commodity trading\nadvisor, commodity pool operators, and locals on and off the exchange\nfloors. Any trading entity that hits a reportable position limit (for instance,\nin the CME currencies, at the end of 2005, the limit was 400 contracts) is re-\nported by the clearing firm to the exchange, which then turns the informa-\ntion over to the CFTC.\nThe next category is the “commercials”—banks and institutions or\nmultinational conglomerate corporations looking to hedge a cash position.\nThe long and short open interest shown as “nonreportable positions” are\nderived by subtracting total long and short “reportable positions” from the\ntotal open interest. Accordingly, for nonreportable positions, the number of\ntraders involved and the commercial/non-commercial classification of each\ntrader is unknown. This balance of positions is assumed to be the small\nspeculators. If you look at the first column under non-commercials, you\nwill see the breakdown of long positions versus short positions. The next\nline down shows the changes from the prior week; this is important infor-\nmation because you will be able to see if these guys unloaded some of their\npositions or added to them from one week to the next. The line under that\ntells you the percent of longs and shorts that are held. The last line shows\nhow many traders there are that control longs or shorts. The information is\ngathered as of the close of business every Tuesday by each of the clearing\nbrokerage firms and is turned over to exchange officials, who then report\nthe information to the regulatory body know as the CFTC. This information\nis released on Friday afternoons at 3:30 P.M. (ET).\nIt is critical before acting on a decision based on this information to see\nif there was a major price swing from Tuesday’s close to the time the in-\nformation was released on Friday, because positions may have changed\nhands. For example, in Figure 1.37, if the British pound was at 1.7400 at 5\nP.M. on Tuesday and the price at Friday’s close was 1.7000, it will indicate\na 400-point move. If the COT showed small speculators net long, I will as-\nsume that the speculators were no longer long, as not many small specula-\ntors can handle a 400-point loss. \nCan traders benefit and make money from this information? The an-\nswer is that there is always a chance to make money. The key is to be able\nto afford to be not too heavily leveraged if the market moves further than\nanticipated. The COT is like an insider information report. It acts like a true\nconsensus of who literally “owns” the market. A forex trader can use this\ndata to determine in a long-term trend run if market participants are too\nheavily positioned on one side of the market. It is generally the small spec-\nulator who is lefty holding the bag.

I am looking for imbalances in markets that have been in a\ntrending market condition for quite some time, and therefore I can develop\na game plan and start looking for timing clues to enter trades accordingly.\nKeep in mind that the commercials sometimes are not right; they are not in\nthe market to time market turns. They are hedging their risk exposure in a\ncash position. Therefore the non-commercials, or professional speculators,\nin the short term are considered the smart money. \nHere are some general guidelines to follow for using the COT Report:\n• If non-commercials are net long, commercials are net long, and the\nnonreportable positions category is net short by at least a two-to-one\nmargin, look at buying opportunities. In other words, go with the pros.\n• If non-commercials are net short, commercials are net short, and the\nnonreportable positions category is net long by at least a two-to-one\nmargin, look at buying opportunities.\n• If non-commercials are net long, commercials are net short, and the\nnonreportable positions category is neutral, meaning not heavily net\nlong or short, look at buying opportunities and stick with the smart\nmoney speculating non-commercials.\nWHAT EVENTS MOVE THE CURRENCY MARKETS?\nTraders need to be aware of several key elements and events that can cause\ncurrency values to move. For one, intervention plays a role in the curren-\ncies. When the Bank of Japan felt that its export business would suffer at\nthe hand of an overvalued yen, it would intervene and sell yen to buy U.S.\ndollars. Countries like Canada and Australia, which produce raw com-\nmodities, saw a rise in their currency valuations as global demand in-\ncreased for their goods and as their economies improved as well. \nForeign currency markets are mainly influenced by international trade\nflows and investment flows, which are the same factors that influence the\nequity and bond markets: \n• Economic and political conditions.\n• Interest rates, inflation, and political instability.\nThese factors have a long-term impact, which makes forex attractive\nto trade due to the long-term trending conditions established by central\n72\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

Japan is closer to changing its zero-interest rule policy;\nand when it does, it may attract money back to Japan and boost its cur-\nrency value\nSTUDY THE “MACRO” ISSUES \nTraders who are new to forex can take comfort in knowing that analyzing\nand forecasting exchange rate movement rely solely on macroeconomic\nfactors—the “big picture” issues and concepts for which information is\nreadily available and intuitively grasped. Once traders have an understand-\ning of the big picture pertaining to an economic region, they can place\ntrades in the currency market to profit from their analysis. Currency traders\nwho are looking to capture big moves in exchange rate movement defi-\nnitely should focus on three issues when attempting to assess the value of\ncurrencies:\n1. Interest Rates—The Carry-Trade Strategy. Each foreign currency has\na central bank that issues an overnight lending rate. This is a prime\ngauge of a currency’s value. In recent history, low interest rates have\nresulted in the devaluation of a currency. Many analysts assume this is\na function of the carry-trade strategy employed by many hedge funds.\nThis is a trade where one buys and holds currencies in a high-yielding\ninterest rate market, such as the United States, and sells or borrows\nmoney from a foreign country where the currency is in a low-yielding\ninterest rate market, such as Japan. There is a significant risk exposure\nto this investment, which requires large capital or a highly leveraged\nposition from an exchange rate fluctuation. \n2. Unemployment Rate. The unemployment rate is a strong indicator of a\ncountry’s economic strength. When unemployment is high, the econ-\nomy may be weak and, hence, its currency may fall in value. The oppo-\nsite is true as well. The question that many economists look to answer\nis what a specific country’s full-employment capacity level is. That\nknowledge will give clues to the peak in productivity and economic\noutput. That knowledge also helps determine a country’s capital flows\nand, therefore, is good information for currency traders to follow for\nlonger-term trend identification.\n3. Geopolitical Events. Like all markets, the currency market is affected\nby what is going on in the world.

Terms such as “flight to\nsafety,” as traders move money from one country to another, cause\nshifts in currency values. These events need to be monitored by forex\ntraders as well.\nForex traders use fundamental analysis as described earlier to identify\ntrading opportunities by analyzing economic information for a longer-term\nperspective. Short-term traders should also understand what and when re-\nports can cause a shift in currency markets. Knowing what time is best to\ntrade the markets will help you nail down when a potential trade may ma-\nterialize. As the pie chart in Figure 1.35 showed, the largest percentage\nvalue traded against the U.S. dollar was the euro. Therefore, that would\nrepresent the European session. The central place of foreign currency deal-\nings is London, where the second-most-active trading volume occurs.\nTherefore, it is where there are likely to be large range swings in the mar-\nket, granting day traders an opportunity to profit. The European session\nruns from 2 A.M. (ET) until 11 A.M. (ET), so a euro currency to U.S. dollar\n(EU/USD) or euro currency to British pound (EU/BP) or a British pound to\nU.S. dollar (BP/USD) would be an appropriate pair selection to trade. \nThe U.S. session opens at 8 A.M. (ET), which overlaps the European ses-\nsion; and these two sessions combined generate the bulk of trading activity.\nMost major U.S. economic reports are released at 8:30 A.M. (ET); and, as ex-\npected, the currency markets generally react off those reports. This offers\ntraders the opportunity to trade off what is normally a violent price spike.\nOnce the U.S. markets close at 5 P.M. (ET), the currency markets are avail-\nable to trade; but it is not until the Asian session opens at 7 P.M. (ET) that\nmarkets will experience potential price swings. The Australian dollar (AUS)\nand Japanese yen (JY) would be what traders would want to focus on, and\nthe trade opportunities there would be the USD/JY or the USD/AUS or the\ncross pair trading the JY/AUS.

Buying high is a technique that\nvery successful professional traders use. It is also a contrarian ap-\nproach. After all, if you feel that the value cannot go any higher, it probably\nwon’t, right? This market condition generally tempts traders to sell. That is\nabsolutely the wrong thinking! In most bull markets, that thinking falls\nunder the category of “picking tops without cause,” “justification,” and\n“trading based off a set of rules or technical reasons”! Do not try to antici-\npate what the market will do next. Simply go with what the market tells you\nit is currently doing. In other words, try to avoid concerning yourself with\nwhy the market is moving; focus on what is occurring. That is my definition\nof staying in the now and, most important, staying with the trend. \nForget that last week the market may have taken a nosedive or that yes-\nterday the market rallied significantly. Concern yourself with what the mar-\nket is doing now. Ask yourself where prices are in relation to the current\ntrend. It is up to you to identify the type of trader you are (day trader, swing\ntrader, long-term trader) and the time frame in which you trade (minutes,\ndays, weeks, . . .).\nFor example, a day trader in the mini–stock index futures or the foreign\nexchange (forex) markets may only be working with a five-minute time\nframe. In that case, she could care less what the market did last week or\nyesterday. A day trader may also want to focus on a 60-minute trend to de-\ncide whether she should hold the position for two or more periods. A swing\ntrader, who would hold a position for several days, may want to see what\n",

Longer-term position traders may want to\nview the trend over several weeks or months. Cracking the code and un-\nderstanding how to interpret what the market is telling you is what this\nbook is about and what it will hopefully teach you.\nAs a trader, you should recognize the immediate environment or mar-\nket condition. Is it up, down, or sideways? After a trend is established, \nlet’s say a bullish trend, it should consist of higher highs and higher lows. It\nis usually a more fruitful situation to buy dips in that environment, as you\nwill you get more out of the trade in price magnitude than you will in sell-\ning the rallies. In a bullish environment, buying begets buying. Higher clos-\ning highs more importantly bring higher highs as momentum and assigned\nvalues are justified. \nWHAT DEFINES MOMENTUM?\nThe close is the assigned value for any market. The law of physics that\nstates “a body in motion tends to stay in motion until a force or obstacle\nstops or changes that motion” really applies to this concept, because higher\nassigned values can and do usually attract more buying and even new buy-\ners. That is what momentum is and why it is the key in trading. Think of\nwhat an auction is like. There is excitement. People are furiously bidding up\nthe price of an object. It attracts more buyers. Gosh, it even attracts people\nto bid on items they don’t even want. Then as value has peaked, the bidding\ndries up; and the last person with the highest bid is awarded the item (or\nstuck buying the high). Trading is essentially the same if you know when\nit’s the right time or price level to enter the market and what signals to look\nfor to exit a trade.\nThere are all kinds of traders, and each one uses different forms of\nanalysis. What I teach short-term stock, forex, and futures traders is that\nthere is immediate equal access to the four common denominators that\neach and every trade has to work with, without prejudice and exclusivity:\n(1) the open, (2) the high, (3) the low, and (4) the close. For stock traders,\nthere is a fifth element: volume. Fugures traders who are longer term or\nwho like to confirm the strength or the weakness of a trend should also be\nconcerned with volume. In futures, unlike in stocks, the volume is not given\nto the investing public in realtime intraday. Truthfully, that is why the fu-\ntures and forex markets depend on technical analysis to speed the analyti-\ncal process to determine a market move on pure price action. After all, it is\nhow we analyze, interpret, and act on the information that makes us differ-\nent as traders. As for forex, we do not have a means to measure volume as\n78\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

That is one reason why many traders\nlose—they anticipate or guess which direction the market will go; they\ntrade without a plan or set of rules to enter a trade. If you do believe that\nthe markets are an effective mechanism for reflecting the perceived value\non a given product at a given time, then you need to learn how to follow the\nflow of the market. A chart shows the market in its current condition. Until\nthat condition changes, you need to go with the flow. So what signals\nshould you look for when conditions change? When the market is in an up-\ntrend, a simple signal is once the market ceases to increase its assigned\nvalue by establishing not only higher highs and higher lows but, most im-\nportant, when a market stops making higher closing highs. \nAs for a market that is in a downtrend, when different events occur—\nsuch as lower highs, lower lows, or, more important, lower closing lows—\nthen it is starting to change conditions. If a bearish market or a bullish\nmarket changes conditions, it will most likely go into what is called a con-\nsolidation or congestion phase.

What we need to do\nthen is, first, learn how to anticipate or discover what forecasting tool\nwould help us determine what the potential top of that uptrend would be\nand, second, understand what clues to look for once it establishes the top\nto help signal us that the trend may resume or that a reversal of the trend\nwill occur.\n80\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\nFIGURE 2.2\nCongestion\nUptrend\nResumption or Reversal?\n",

After that, as you\ncan see, it did move higher at the start of 2006; but the tweezer top forma-\ntion (equal and opposite) contained the rally, and prices ended back where\nthey started. \nFIND THE CLUES!\nFrom a strict chart-reading perspective, finding the clues as to when a trend\nis nearing completion is a matter of watching the relationship of the close\nof the time period for which you are trading to past highs and lows. If you\nstudy the chart in Figure 2.3, you will see the first leg or run-up in the mar-\nket from September 2004 until the first lower closing low occurred in\nMarch 2005. The market never made a lower closing low during that time\nperiod. Once it did, the market entered a consolidation phase. That was the\nfirst conditional change. The sequence of higher highs, higher lows, and\nhigher closing highs stopped; and a new conditional change occurred—the\nmarket made a lower closing low and closed below the open twice in a row.\nThe chart in Figure 2.4 zooms in on that specific area to help highlight what\noccurs when a trend pauses or exhausts itself.\nAs traders, we are searching for information that will give us clues to an\nadvantageous entry spot to go long, whether it is at the beginning stages of\na bottom or breaking out of a congestion phase or a sideways channel. De-\ntermining the market condition, whether it is bullish, bearish, or neutral, is\nwhat will help us in our trading decisions. There are many forms of techni-\ncal analysis studies to help us achieve that. The best form of trend analysis\nis the simple trend-line approach; you start with the lowest low point and\nthen draw the line up until the next corrective low point. Figure 2.5 demon-\nstrates the most common way to draw a supporting trend line. After a long\nhard crash in IBM, a low was made on 4/17/2005 at 71.85 (the Weekly Pivot\nPoint S-1 targeted a low of 72.50). Drawing a line from that low and ex-\ntending it out to the second reactionary low and extending forward illus-\ntrated a rising trend. As the market kept bouncing near that support line\n(S-1), it advanced higher. Using this form of simple analysis will help you\nidentify the market’s condition and, therefore, develop a trading plan or\nkeep you focused to buy breaks.\nAs for determining a bearish or downward trend, you need to draw a\nline from a peak, or top, in the market, as shown in Figure 2.6. You have a\nseries of lower highs to draw a resistance trend line. Start with the first\npeak, extend the line downward to the next high, and then extend the line\nforward. This will help you remain focused that the market is bearish, and\ntherefore you want to focus on selling opportunities.\n82\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

      "text": "MOVING AVERAGES HELP!\nThe next method for identifying whether the market is bullish, bearish, or\nin a consolidation phase is utilizing moving averages. The most familiar\none is the benchmark 200-day moving average. Most technicians and short-\nterm traders feel this is a worthless time period, with which I agree for\nshort- to intermediate-term trading. \nRemember that the idea in using moving averages is to help determine\nthe true direction of the market. The longer the time period used in a mov-\ning average, the less effective it is for shorter-term trading. Keep in mind\nthat a 200-day moving average is over 28 weeks, more than half a year. The\nFederal Reserve raised rates four times in 2005 in that same time period.\nThat leaves way too much time and, more important, distance between\nprices and the moving average to generate buy or sell signals.\nWhen using moving averages the general guideline is simple:\n• If prices are above the moving average, look to buy pullbacks or to\ntake buy signals, as the market is in a bullish mode or in an uptrend. \n• If prices are trading below the moving average, look to sell rallies or to\ntake sell signals, as the market is bearish or in a downtrend.\nAnother instance in which traders use moving averages in helping their\ntrading is determining what is called “regression to the mean.” This is a\nterm many traders hear but really do not understand. It refers to the condi-\ntion when prices deviate too far from the mean or average. At that tme,\nprices will regress, or return, to the average; or the market will pause or\nconsolidate until the average catches up to the price. You will notice what\nI call a “gap band” signal. This is what will occur when the prices gap too far\naway from the moving averages or bands and give a trader an opportunity\nfor a countertrend trade. Another way to describe this is that when a mar-\nket deviates, or departs, too far from the moving average, it gives an op-\nportunity for a speculator to take advantage of this condition, which\ngenerally ends up with prices reaching an unsustainable extreme and then\nreturning back toward the moving averages for a short-term price swing.\nThe question is at what distance or price level do prices deviate, or move\ntoo far away, from the moving average before market prices return to the\nmoving average or the market pauses in order for the moving average to\ncatch up to the prices. \nAs you can see in Figure 2.10, the market trends higher; but at times we\nsee reactions that shift values from one extreme to another. How do we use\nmoving averages effectively? More important, which time frames and\nwhich set of conditional settings should we employ to give us a true sense\nor value of the market? We will cover a different concept using a pivot\n88\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

Those moves are unsustainable and thus form what we call\novervalued or undervalued in relation to the trend line or moving average.\nMost market behavior as reflected by the human emotional state goes into\nextremes.

This method also works when I am looking at a swing trade,\nwhich is a trade that may last anywhere from one to three days. For longer-\nterm trading, I use volume studies in the stock and futures markets to help\nme confirm the strength or weakness of a trend or to gather a clue as to\nwhen a major reversal is ready to occur. For spot foreign exchange (forex)\ncurrency trading, volume figures are available to use from the futures mar-\nkets; but because those figures are not available until the end of day, they\nare not good day trading indicator tools. Therefore, the use of oscillators\nand indicators help to confirm the condition of the market once I am in a\ntrade or about to make a trade based on an extreme price swing. \nSome questions that are often asked when I am giving a seminar or a\npresentation at a conference are: How many indicators do you suggest\nusing at one time? Do you get analysis paralysis from using too many? The\nanswer is that I use two indicators: stochastics and moving average con-\nvergence/divergence (MACD). \nSince trending conditions exist for less than 30 to 40 percent of the\ntime, you can anticipate that after a nice trend directional move, the market\nwill move in a consolidation phase, or “whipsaw” as most people call it. In\nchoppy range-bound conditions, stochastics is your friend; in trending mar-\nket conditions, MACD will give you solid signals.\nThe myth surrounding MACD is that one of the best indicators out\nthere is not necessarily true. So goes the old adage that there is no holy grail\nfor any single trading indicator or style. This is due to the fact that markets\nchange, as do market conditions and people’s perception on a product’s\ngiven value or anticipated value in any given time. I believe that the sto-\nchastic indicator is a more useful tool than the MACD during certain mar-\nket conditions and for determining various signals, such as divergences or\nconvergences. They both can be used for pinpointing reversals.\nIt is likely that one will give a faster signal than the other, and vice\nversa. The one fact is that in trending markets, MACD can be your friend by\nhelping you to stay in a trade longer, thus milking a position for more than\nyou would imagine. This chapter will show several rules and techniques for\nusing both of these indicators. \nSTOCHASTICS\nStochastics, a range-based oscillator, is also considered a momentum os-\ncillator. George C.

His indicator is a popular\ntechnical tool used to help determine whether a market is overbought,\nmeaning that prices have advanced too far too soon and are due for a\ndownside correction, or oversold, meaning that prices have declined too far\ntoo soon and are due for an upside correction. Stochastics is based on a\nmathematical formula that is used to compare the settlement price of a\nspecific time period to the price range of a specific number of past periods. \nThe method works based on the premise that in a bull, or up-trending,\nmarket, prices will tend to make higher highs and that the settlement price,\nor close, will usually tend to be in the upper end of that time period’s trad-\ning range, or at least closer to the high. When the momentum starts to fade,\nthe settlement prices will start to push away from the upper boundaries of\nthe range; and the stochastics indicator will show that the bullish momen-\ntum is starting to change. The exact opposite is true for bearish, or down-\ntrending, markets. \nThere are two lines that are referred to as %K and %D. These are plot-\nted on a horizontal axis for a given time period, and the vertical axis is plot-\nted on a scale from 0 percent to 100 percent. As you will see from the\nformula, %K will be the faster of the two lines and will change direction be-\ncause the %D line is a moving average of %K. The unique feature of the sto-\nchastics reading is the moving average crossover feature. \nStochastics is a range-based oscillator with readings between 0 per-\ncent and 100 percent. The main guidelines reflect the thought that readings\nover 80 percent indicate that a market condition is overbought and ripe for\na downside correction and that readings under 20 percent signal the market\nis oversold and ripe for a bounce. While that certainly is the case, generally\nspeaking, I look for more clues within the indicator to trigger a trade signal. \nThe formula to calculate the first component for fast stochastics using\na 14-period look back setting for %K is:\n%K = c – Ln/Hn – Ln * 100 \nwhere c\n= closing price of current period\nLn = lowest low during n period of time\nHn = highest high during n period of time \nn\n= number of periods\nThe second calculation is the %D (3-period). It is the moving average \nof %K.\n%D = 100(Hn/Ln) \nwhere HN = the n period sum of (c – Ln)\nHow to Read Oscillators to Spot Overbought or Oversold Conditions\n95\n",

That is what generates a sell signal at 10838. That would be a\nprofitable scalp of 28 points at $5 per point, which is $140 on a day trading\nmargin of $500, which is what most futures brokerage firms charge. \nSTOCHASTICS CONFIRMS THE TURN\nNow looking at the sell signal, we would have an opportunity to go short at\n10838 as the market pivots and turns, as I say, off the resistance level as the\nstochastics confirms with a %K and %D hook sell signal once both lines\ncross and close below the 80 percent line. Follow the flow of the market\nafter that point: lower highs, lower lows, and, more important, lower clos-\ning lows all the way down to a low of 10739. That is a 99-point decline or\n$495 per contract—almost a 100 percent return on your day trading margin.\nAs the market declines, we see the stochastics crossing above and back\nbelow its respective values; but never does it cross back and close above\nthe 20 percent line. I am asked at what level do you take profits. I will go\nover specific target exit levels later; but for right now, the most simplistic\nanswer is at the last trading price near 10758.

(CT). \nMACD\nIn simplest terms, moving average convergence/divergence is an indicator\nthat shows when a short-term moving average crosses over a longer-term\nmoving average. Gerald Appel developed this indicator as we know it\ntoday, and he developed it for the purpose of stock trading. It is now widely\nused for short-term trading signals in stocks, futures, and forex markets, as\nwell as for swing and position traders. It is composed of using three expo-\nnential moving averages. The initial inputs for the calculations were a 9-pe-\nriod, a 12-period, and a 26-period. The concept behind this indicator is to\ncalculate a value, which is the difference between the two exponential mov-\ning averages, which then compares that to the 9-period exponential moving\naverage. What we get is a moving average crossover feature and a zero-line\noscillator, and that helps us to identify overbought and oversold market\nconditions.\nI might add that because traders are now more computer savvy than\never before and because many charting software packages such as \nRealTick allow traders to change or optimize the settings or parameters, it\nis easy to change, or “tweak,” the variables in Appel’s original calculations.\nTraders can increase the time periods in the moving average calculations to\ngenerate fewer trade signals and can shorten the time periods to generate\nmore trade signals. Just as is the case for most indicators, the higher the\ntime periods used, the less sensitive the indicator will be to changes in\nprice movements. MACD signals react quickly to changes in the market—\nthat is why a lot of analysts, including myself, use it. It helps clear the pic-\nture when moving average crossovers occur. It measures the relative\nstrength between where current prices are as compared to past time frames\nfrom a short-term perspective to a longer-term perspective. \nThe MACD indicator is constructed with two lines: One is the 9-period\nexponential average (slow line), and the other is the difference between the\n12- and 26-period exponential moving averages (fast line). In general, when\nthe fast line crosses above the slow line, a buy signal is generated; the op-\nposite is true for sell signals. \nHow to Read Oscillators to Spot Overbought or Oversold Conditions\n103\n",

If\nthe MACD line is above the zero line, prices are usually trending higher. The\nopposite is true if the MACD is declining below the zero line. The MACD is\na lagging indicator; that is, it is based off moving averages. We want to look\nfor the zero-line crossovers to identify market changes and to help confirm\ntrade entries or trigger action to exit a position. As you can see in the e-\nmini–Standard & Poor’s (S&P) chart in Figure 3.7, the MACD readings cross\nback above the zero line, indicating a confirmed shift in momentum.

The truth is that many\nleading educators in the field of forex and stock trading have either bought\nmy advanced trading course or attended one of my live two-day trading\nseminars and now share these methods. These are the same techniques I\nwill explain and teach in the following chapters and reveal in the accompa-\nnying CD (compact disc).\nRemember I explained previously that as a trader you have the right\nand the obligation to understand everything there is about trading. You\nneed to have a good understanding of game theory. Many traders today use\na “black box” method, which is run by algorithm means, that triggers trades\nautomatically. You must understand what goes into building a trading sys-\ntem and how it triggers the automatic reaction when a market price hits at\nor near a specific level. You are competing not just against fellow traders,\nbut against institutions and major investment groups as well as savvy com-\nputer experts, who have a method for removing the emotional element\nfrom trading. So what are these levels, and why do we see major reactions\nor reversals from these mysterious points on the charts?\nSUPPORT AND RESISTANCE IN DISGUISE\nIf a market departs too far from the mean or moving average, there are two\nsides to consider: one from a profit perspective, and the other from a risk\nperspective. Institutions and professional traders know this and will have a\npredetermined price level calculated to either enter or exit a position. In\nlaymen’s terms, if a market went too far too fast, it is time to get out and\ntake a profit or to take advantage of an extreme price move by initiating a\ncountertrend trade. So in order to gauge what the standard deviation is,\nmany professional traders use pivot point analysis because it is based on a\ntestable method. \nPivots are disguised price points because they cannot be detected most\ntimes using such conventional technical analysis techniques as traditional\nsupport and resistance trend lines, Fibonacci levels, and Gann fan angles,\nand indicators like moving averages and such oscillators as the CCI (com-\nmodity channel indicator), stochastics, and the MACD (moving average\nconvergence/divergence) studies. It is imperative that you know how to de-\ntermine where the pivots are so you are aware at what time and price level\nthe market will most likely change direction. That does not mean to say that\nat times pivot points coincide or line up near one of these other technical\nstudies. In fact, pivot point levels coincide frequently with Fabonacci ex-\ntension correction levels, which are referred to as confluence or coinci-\ndental factors. I will explain that in more detail as well.\n122\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

      "text": "Pivot point analysis is the best “right side” of the chart indicator, as I\nlike to call it, due to its predictive accuracy. It is a mathematical formula, as\nI understand, originally developed by Henry Wheeler Chase in the 1930s.\nChester W. Keltner used part of the formula to develop the Keltner bands as\ndescribed in his book, How to Make Money in Commodities (Keltner Sta-\ntistical Service, 1961). However, it was really Larry Williams who was cred-\nited with repopularizing the analysis in his book How I Made One Million\nDollars Last Year Trading Commodities (Windsor Books, 1979). Don Lam-\nbert, the creator of the commodity channel indicator, uses the pivot point\nformula that makes the CCI work.\nIn my first book, A Complete Guide to Technical Trading Tactics\n(Wiley, 2004), I illustrated many trading methods that you can apply using\npivot point analysis, including the power of multiple time frames or what is\nknow as confluence of various target levels. This book will highlight those\ntechniques, as well as explain how to incorporate the pivot point as a mov-\ning average trading system and how to filter out and narrow the field of the\nrespective support and resistance numbers, and will divulge various for-\nmulas that are popular today. \nMATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS\nPivot point is a mathematical formula designed to determine the potential\nrange expansion based on a previous time period’s data, which include the\nhigh, the low, and the close or settlement price. One reason why I believe\nin using these variables from a given time period’s range is that they reflect\nall market participants’ collective perception of value for that time period.\nIn the beginning of the book, I quoted Jesse Livermore: “The patterns the\ntraders and technicians observe are simply the reflections of human emo-\ntional behavior” [Richard Suitten, Trade Like Jesse Livermore (Wiley, 2005,\np. 70)]. The range, which is the high and the low of a given time period, ac-\ncurately reflects all market participants’ exuberant bullishness and pes-\nsimistic bearishness for that trading session. The high and the low of a\ngiven period are certainly important as they mirror human emotional be-\nhavior. Also, the high is a reference point for those who bought out of\ngreed, thinking they were missing an opportunity; they certainly won’t for-\nget how much they lost and how the market reacted as it declined from that\nlevel. The opposite is true for those who sold the low of a given session out\nof fear that they would lose more by staying in a long trade; they certainly\nwill respect that price point the next time the market trades back at that\nlevel. So the high and the low are important reference points of interest.\nWith that said, pivot point analysis incorporates the three most important\nelements—the high, the low, and the close—of a given trading session. \nPivot Points\n123\n",

      "text": "THE LEADING INDICATOR\nThe definition of the pivot point is the average of the high, the low, and the\nclosing price. Pivot point analysis is mainly used as support and resistance\nlevels. The pivot point is the heartbeat of the analysis; without it, projected\nranges and market condition cannot be determined. It does act as a support\nor resistance level as well. Pivot point analysis helps as a leading price indi-\ncator for traders because it gives traders advanced indication of potential\nhighs or lows or, in some cases, both in a given time period, unlike Fibonacci\nstudies, where there is no predicted time period in which a projected price\ncorrection or projection will occur. I want to step up the concept so that you\ncan develop a trading system on some powerful setups and on what triggers\na trade. As I disclosed, professional stock, forex, and futures traders \nhave had significant success in utilizing these “hidden lines”; and I think \nthat with a more thorough understanding of the concept, so will you.\nAs a quick review, one of the main benefits for using pivot point calcu-\nlations is that they help determine when to enter and when to exit posi-\ntions. As a trader, you already know you can only book a profit when you\nexit; and if you don’t exit a losing trade quickly, it is hard to maintain, or\nkeep, what you have already made. Pivot points are used to project support\nand resistance or actual highs and lows of trading sessions. These numbers\nare derived from a mathematical formula; there are several versions that,\nfor your benefit, I will go into; but keep in mind that I still use the most com-\nmon method to derive my analysis. Here are the most common formulas: \n• Pivot Point—the pivot point (P) is the sum of the high (H), the low (L),\nand the close (C) divided by three.\nP = (H + L + C)/3\n• Resistance Level 2—R-2 is the pivot point number plus the high and\nminus the low.\nR-2 = P + H – L\n• Resistance Level 1—R-1 is the pivot point number times two minus\nthe low.\nR-1 = (P × 2) – L\n• Support Level 1—S-1 is the pivot point number times two minus \nthe high.\nS-1 = (P × 2) – H\n124\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

It seems \nthat I have noticed that the spot forex currency markets tend to experi-\nence a double dose of price shocks beause they are exposed to foreign \neconomic developments and U.S. economic developments that per-\ntain to a specific country’s currency. This tends to make wide trading\nranges. Therefore, a third level of projected support and resistance were\ncalculated \nResistance Level 3—R-3 = H + 2 × (Pivot – Low) or (P – S-1) + R-2\nSupport Level 3—S-3 = L – 2 × (High – Pivot) or P – (R-2 – S-1)\nThere are other variations that include adding the opening range, in\nwhich case you would simply find the sum of the open, the high, the \nlow, and the close; and then divide it by four to derive the actual pivot\npoint.\nP = (O + H + L + C) /4\nOne more variation of that concept—to factor in gaps from adverse\nprice moves from one day to the next—is to take the previous session’s\nhigh, low, and close, add in the new trading session’s open, and then \nadd in those variables and divide by four. In using both open prices, \nyou still calculate the extreme support and resistance levels with the same\nformulas. \nP = (new O + old H + old L + old C) /4\nLet’s go over what these numbers mean and how price action reacts\nwith these projected target levels. But first, let me state that I personally do\nnot use the R-3 or S-3 levels because I believe in looking at the progressively\nhigher time period’s price support or resistance projections. For example,\nfrom the daily numbers, I would look at the weekly numbers, and then from\nthe weekly numbers I would look at the monthly numbers. The longer the\ntime frame, the more important or significant the data.

Few go over how to target exits. Longer-term traders have\nread the works done on volume analysis to help determine the strength or\nthe weakness of a trend. There is further information on consensus studies,\nsuch as the Commitment of Traders (COT) reports; the VIX, which is a\nvolatility index, is based on calculations using options on the Standard &\nPoor’s (S&P) 500 Stock Index. Plus, the put-to-call ratio helps give investors\nan idea if a trend is ready to change. None of these studies actually helps a\ntrader with targeting a potential trading range in a given time period. That\ninformation will help a trader with setups and triggers on entering a posi-\ntion and, most important, exiting a position. This is where pivot point\nanalysis will help you.\nThink for a moment: If most technical tools are lagging indicators and\nif most traders follow and use these trading indicators to make trading de-\ncisions, then it would make sense that most traders get trading signals and\nexecute entering into a position on a lagging basis or well after a move has\nbeen established. Then, if the same indicator gives the exit signal too late,\nperhaps that is what perpetuates habit or the consistency of losing money\nin the markets, from entering or exiting later, based on lagging indicators.\nThen, in order to adjust getting in too late, traders anticipate a market\nturn; and more times than not, that turns out to be a bad trading decision.\nOr traders may decide to just “hang in there” a while longer, thinking that\nthe market may just return and give them back the sweet profits that were\njust accumulated in the trade. That is a syndrome that many traders tell me\nthey fell victim to. By using pivot point support and resistance levels, you\ncan speed up the analytical process on entries; and by employing certain\ntrade management techniques that we will go over in a later chapter, you\ncan effectively help improve your exits. After all, that is one of the most im-\nportant aspects of trading. A profit is just a paper asset until a position is\noffset. The offset relies on an exit strategy. Ask yourself this question: How\nmany times have I been in a trade and thought I was doing the correct thing\nby letting my winners ride, by holding on to the position only to see my\npaper profits erode and then perhaps turn into a loss? The flip side to this\nis: How many times have I taken a quick profit, banked the money, and no\nmore than a few moments later watched the market explode dramatically\nfurther in the direction of my original position? Just when you say the mar-\nket can’t move any further, that’s when it usually does. You need discipline\nand patience to stay with a trade.

Keep telling yourself that what happened in the past or per-\nhaps even your last trade is of no concern to the current trade you are in.\nRemember that each trade will have a different outcome. The patterns we\nsee and the way a market behaves at or near a pivot point support or resis-\ntance level will be different. Therefore, the velocity and the magnitude of a\nprice move will vary every time. For example, as shown in Figure 5.1, prices\ncould come close to but not exactly hit the pivot level. That does not mean\nprices will do that every time. As Figure 5.2 shows, prices can exceed re-\nsistance by a small margin; this may invite you to buy a breakout of the re-\nsistance level and trap you into buying the high. Then, as Figure 5.3\nillustrates, prices can hit the pivot support number exactly, which does\nhappen frequently. But if you program yourself to anticipate, that will be\nthe outcome every time; you will be in for a rude awakening due to the po-\ntential that Figure 5.4 represents the occurrence that sometimes prices just\ncome close and consolidate or congest near the pivot point support or re-\nsistance levels for a period of time before reacting off those levels. Once\nagain, the market’s past performance is not indicative of future results; so\nwe need more information in the thought process to initiate a trade and to\nexit a trade.

Here is why: The night ses-\nsions of most markets include the Asian and the European markets; and\nthose participants do trade in U.S. financial markets. If an event took place\nthat caused a market to move and a trade price was recorded, then it is a\nvalid price point and will be put in the history books as a trade occurring.\nTherefore, I consider that information as accurate from a valid trading ses-\nsion. Most U.S. retail or individual speculators may not be up at 3 A.M. (CT)\ntrading off a market move; but potentially, professional traders are, and\ntherefore the information is considered valid. Gosh, even the exchanges\nseem to believe it’s valid since money moves into and out of an account if\na trade is made; so the high or low of that period should be considered.\nMULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS\nDaily, weekly, and monthly time frames can and should be utilized as well.\nTo understand how price moves within the pivots, begin by breaking down\nthe time frames from longer-term to shorter-term.

For example, using a daily analysis, if\nTuesday had a wide trading range and then Wednesday had a small range,\nI would keep the targeted support and resistance numbers derived from\nTuesday in mind for Thursday’s session. The same principle applies to a\nweek or a month. \nIn the world of 24-hour trading, the most popular question I get from\nthose studying and using pivot points is, “What are the times that you derive\nthe high-low-close information from?” There are many different people\ntelling many different stories. Here is what I do and what seems to work\nbest. For starters, just keep things simple and apply some good old-fash-\nioned common sense. If the exchanges and the banking system use a spe-\ncific time to settle a market, then that is the time that you should consider\na close. The exchanges and banks should know—their rules make the\nmoney move. I want to follow the money flow. \n• Stock traders use the settlement price from the close of business at 4\nP.M. (ET).\n• Forex traders should use the 5 P.M. (ET) New York bank settlement\nclose.\n• Futures traders, in the e-mini–S&P, Nasdaq, and Russell contracts, use\nthe close of 3:15 P.M. (CT). For the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)\nmini-Dow contract, I take the close at 4 P.M. (CT). \n• For the weekly calculations, take the open from Sunday night’s ses-\nsion, and use the close on Friday. \n• For the monthly calculations, take the open from the first day of the\nmonth, and use the close of the last day of the month.\nWe have established the reasons why we use all sessions for extracting\nthe range, or high and low, and what time periods constitute the closes. We\nknow where and how and when. Now, let me show you what pivot point\n130\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

This\nmethod can work for a short-term application for identifying a potential\nrange for a day, a week, or a month. By having a good idea, well in advance,\nof what the high or the low for a given time period might be, you are able to\nuse this information to apply the right trading vehicle or strategy, such as\nwhether it is simply selecting an entry level or getting in or selecting a profit\nobjective or getting out of a trade. You could also determine whether to\napply an option strategy or when to use an exchange traded fund, as we\ndiscussed in Chapter 1. \nPredicting Highs and Lows Using the\nCalculations\nWhat I do to determine the potential range for a given session is to take the\nR-1 and the S-1 initially for my analysis, especially in low-volume consoli-\ndating trading sessions. \nI use the actual pivot point for many things; one that is useful is under-\nstanding that it can be used as an actual trading number in determining the\nhigh or the low of a given time period, especially in strong bull or bear mar-\nket conditions. In an extremely bullish market condition, the pivot point\ncan become the target low for the trading session. This number represents\nthe true value of a prior session. In an up-trending market, if the market\ngaps higher above the pivot point, then a retracement back to the pivot will\nattract buyers. Until that pivot point is broken by prices trading below that\nlevel, traders will step in and buy the pullback. The opposite is true in an ex-\ntremely bearish market condition; the pivot point will act as the target high\nfor the session. If a news-driven event causes the market to gap lower, once\ntraders access the news and discover it is not as bearish as thought, prices\nmay trade back up to test the pivot point; if the market fails to break out\nabove that price level and trades higher, sellers will enter the market and\ntake action, pressing the market lower again.\nFiltering the Numbers\nTechnically speaking, in a bearish market, the highs should be lower and\nthe lows should be lower than those of the preceding time frame. If they\nare, then I use that information to help me filter out unnecessary data or ex-\ncessive support and resistance numbers on my charts. I use the actual pivot\npoint up to the R-1 number for resistance, and then I target the S-2 for the\npotential low or for that time period’s trading range.\nAs you can see in Figure 5.6, if I determine the market is bearish and if\n132\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

If I apply the same methodology on daily,\nweekly, and monthly charts, instead of 39 numbers, I am now working with\njust 9 numbers. Once again, I am not using the numbers to place orders\nahead of time (even though you could); I use the numbers as a guide. These\nnumbers work so well and often act as a self-fulfilling prophecy because so\nmany institutions and professional traders do use them. Many have differ-\nent size positions on. Some traders may not wait for the exact number to\nhit and may start scaling out of positions (as I do); and so should you. With\nthis method, you can use these numbers as exit areas on your trades. As\nFigure 5.7 depicts, in a bullish market environment, by definition you may\nagree that the highs should be higher and the lows should be higher than\nthose of the preceding time period. When I have determined that we are in\na bullish trend, I target the S-1 up to the pivot point for the low of the ses-\nsion and the R-2 for targeting the high; and that will give me an idea of what\nthe potential trading range will be. \nPivot Points\n133\nFIGURE 5.6\n",

That is where the significance of the weekly and the monthly\nnumbers comes into play. \nBack in the late 1990s when I owned a brokerage firm, I developed a\nmethod to help me line up the pivot point levels as shown in Figure 5.8; I\nhad all my brokers use these numbers, and many still do to this day. The\ntable of information was for the trading session of 1/18/2006. \nMy method categorizes the pivot point levels to the various market con-\nditions, such as neutral (Target Key) bullish, and bearish. I like to know\nwhat the prior time period’s range and close were for fast access, so I in-\ncluded that in as well. Since the pivot point is important, I include that on\nthe sheet, as shown in the last column on the right. The third column from\nthe right states Market Direction. That is a moving average of the actual\npivot point. \nIf the pivot point and the close or settlement price are below the mar-\nket direction number, then the market condition is deemed to be in a bear-\nish mode; and it helps me to line up the R-1 and S-1 numbers as the\nprojected target range for that next session.

      "text": "THE IMPORTANCE OF CONFLUENCE\nTime is an essential element in trading. There are many instances when\ntraders are correct in their predictions for a top or a bottom in a market;\nbut  they are off in their timing, which results in a loss. Many analysts \nwere calling for a top or for the bubble to burst in the stock market in 1999.\nIn that situation, not demonstrating patience to wait would have resulted\nin dramatic loss of profit potential or worse, actual losses due to selling\nshort stock too early. How about economists’ predictions of a housing\nbubble back in 2003 and their expectations for a decline in real estate\nprices? By July 2006 we had started to see prices go back down but not \nto the severity as was predicted and certainly not at the time that was \nexpected by economists. I can go on and on with examples when prog-\nnostications were correct, but timing was really wrong, resulting in a fi-\nnancial loss. \nTime and Price\nAs I stated earlier, pivot point analysis relies on both time and price\nspecifics in its calculations to project future support and resistance levels.\nBy incorporating price data for various time frames, such as daily, weekly,\nand monthly, the more price areas that coincide with the different time pe-\nriods, the greater is the likelihood that these price clusters will repel the\nmarket’s advance in an uptrend or cause prices to reverse in a downtrend.\nThis clustering, or confluence, from more than one time period that con-\nvergences with another is an awesome event and can translate into a very\nlucrative setup. The time frames of numbers that target a specific price\nlevel is termed confluence; in other words, the more corroborating numbers\nthat target a general area, the greater is the significance of that specific tar-\ngeted price level. Pivot calculations work to pinpoint almost exact times\nand prices for trades in various markets and can be used to validate other\nanalysis. Remember this phrase: “There is always strength in numbers!”\nThe more pivot numbers that line up, the greater is the potential for a reac-\ntion off those levels. This knowledge, combined with identifying the shift in\nmomentum by identifying and acting on strong triggers, increases the prob-\nability of a successful trade. \nAs an example, Figure 5.14 shows the daily, weekly, and monthly pivot\npoint numbers drawn across the chart; this gives a trader a heads up that\nthe market may reach an unsustainable extreme or oversold market condi-\ntion. Just by looking at the graph, you can see that the market has been in\na prolonged downtrend. Generally, the market may stop its descent at a\nPivot Points\n141\n",

When the market starts to give\nclues as to a bottom, you can determine a low-risk entry, as a bottom has\nbeen defined. What would not be known is how high the market’s reaction\nwill be off this target level of support. This is where the candle chart section\nwill play an important role in helping to determine the strength of the\ntrend’s reversal. \nIn Figure 5.15, we have a weekly stock chart on Alcoa. Here we see a\nconfluence of two higher-degree time periods, such as the weekly and\nmonthly support numbers. What is uncanny is that the weekly pivot S-1 tar-\nget low number was 22.33, with the actual low coming in at 22.28, just pen-\nnies below the pivot support number. The monthly number lined up a little\nhigher than that at 22.99, which is a slightly wider margin of error. Remem-\nber, when I am trading, I am not looking to catch a falling knife by antici-\npating a bottom, even though in this example you could have placed a buy\norder at the weekly number; and as the price moved through your buy\norder, you may have been filled—and that was a great buy. However, the\nbetter course of action, and the more reliable method to trade off this con-\nfluence area, was to wait for a confirmed buy signal, such as the high close\ndoji signal (we go over that in Chapter 7). Notice the moving average\ncrossover and that prices confirm a conditional change in the market by\nclosing above the open and closing above both moving average compo-\nnents.

Generally speaking, professional trading\nmanaged funds receive payment by a performance fee (profits) at the end\nof a quarter.

If you recall in Chapter 1, I stated\nthat forex traders can borrow information from the futures industry. One\nsuch piece of data is the CFTC Commitment of Traders report. In essence,\nthis report reveals whose hands “control” the market. Except for the yen, all\ncurrencies are quoted as the currency versus the U.S. dollar. The yen fu-\ntures are quoted as the opposite—as the spot forex markets. So spot forex\nwould quote the yen as 117.35; the futures quote would be .8572. What this\nmeans is that when the CFTC report shows a net short position, traders are\nin a long position in the spot yen forex markets against the dollar. As the\nCFTC report showed at the end of the trading session as of 11/29/2005, the\nfunds, or the “non-commercials,” were long 22,626 contracts and short\n86,626. That is a net short position of 64,000 contracts. Each contract is\n1,250,000 worth of yen! The “commercials” were long 154,396 contracts and\nshort 85,604 positions. The small speculators were long 29,368 contracts\nand short 34,160 positions. This means the banks, or “smart money,” estab-\nlished a protective hedge position in the futures, betting that the spot yen\nwould fall in value against the dollar. Keep in mind that the non-commer-\ncials are considered professional speculators; they, too, are considered the\nsmart money. The difference is that they are speculating and will not gen-\nerally take delivery of a futures contract, which is 1,250,000 worth of Japan-\nese yen. \nIf we examine Figure 5.19 closely, we notice that after a substantial\nprice appreciation in a relatively short period of time, prices hit just past the\nmonthly R-1 of 121.04. Remember that the low on September 5, just three\nmonths earlier, was 108.76. So the market made a huge up move, and the\nbanks and institutions or commercials were betting prices would fall. The\nends of the year and of the quarter were closing in, and we were hitting up\nagainst a confluence of pivot point resistance. The weekly R-1 was 121.77;\nand on the day the actual price high occurred at 121.40, the daily pivot R-1\nwas 121.16. When we combine the pivot point resistance levels with a few\nbearish candle patterns, such as the rickshaw doji that formed the day be-\nfore the high or the trigger to initiate a sell that occurred on the third day\nafter the target high was made you have a high chance to see a negative\nmarket reaction on price reversal. Market tops that align with a cluster, or\nconfluence, of various pivot points can result in tremendous market rever-\nsals, as this example shows, especially as they coincide with a major con-\nsensus reading toward the end of the quarter.\nThe power of a sell-off does not necessarily have to occur near the end\nof a quarter. In equities, end-of-year tax-loss selling prevails; and at the\nfirst of the new year, as pension funds are buying stock, others are looking\nto cash out their profits for tax deferment purposes.

Table 5.4 shows that the high in December was\nfrom a different time period and had an assigned value different from the\nweekly or daily number; and the same holds true for the low and the clos-\ning values. \nThe relationship that exists between geopolitical issues and economic\nconditions (such as inflation, interest rates, foreign currencies, and gold)\nfrom a historic perspective has been easy to track. In general terms, at\ntimes when the dollar goes up in value, gold prices decline. When interest\nrates climb, lease rates are more expensive, therefore putting downward\npressure on gold. Gold prices also move higher as investors buy gold as a\nsafe haven investment, as it acts as cash as well in times when doubt ex-\nists over the stability of a country’s economic condition or when currency\nvalues change, as happened in the middle of 2005 when dissention among\neuro zone countries existed and riots due to political instability in France\ndeveloped.\nBy late 2005, the dollar rallied as interest rates climbed, widening the\ninterest rate differentials between the United States and foreign countries.\nGold rallied sharply higher on these events, from the low on February 8,\n2005, at 410 per ounce.

Many automated trading systems use moving\naverages or some derivative of a moving average to generate buy and sell\nsignals. Moving averages are considered classic indicators and are very\npopular with traders today. Most technicians view the moving average as a\nway to signal a change in the direction of the trend, as well as a way to\nsmooth out the volatility of the market. In Chapter 2, we covered a key com-\nponent in understanding the concept of trend, which in essence gives you\nthe ability to understand the concept of momentum. Remember this: “In a\nbullish environment, buying begets buying.” Higher closing highs bring\nhigher highs as momentum and assigned values (the closes) are justified.\nThe law of physics that states that “a body in motion tends to stay in motion\nuntil a force or obstacle stops or changes that motion” applies in this sce-\nnario because higher assigned values can induce more buying from existing\nbuyers and can attract new buyers. Once again, the opposite is true of a\nbearish market: Lower closing lows bring lower lows as momentum and as-\nsigned values are justified. The lower assigned values induce more selling\nby existing sellers and can attract new sellers into the market. \nWhen prices have appreciated and all buyers have exhausted their re-\nsources to add more long positions in a bull market, prices have reached\nwhat is known as absolute value. Prices will more than likely consolidate\nfor a period of time before they change direction and reverse lower in\nvalue. The opposite is true in a downtrending market. An important com-\n",

Momentum and the psychology of the perception of the value of a\ngiven market in a given time period are what will move prices from a con-\nsolidation, or congestion phase, back to a trending condition.\nDETERMINING TREND DIRECTION\nSimply put, one way to determine the trend is by drawing trend lines. In \nan uptrend, we should see a sequence of higher highs and higher lows, so\nwe would draw a line against the lows and extend it outward to forecast a\nsupport level sometime in the future. In a downtrend, as the sequence of\nevents shows lower highs and lower lows, we would draw a line against the\ntop of the highs and extend it outward to help forecast a resistance point in\nthe future. \nAnother method used in determining trend line support and resistance\nis through the use of moving averages. The most popular method of using a\nmoving average is to average the closing prices (sometimes referred to as\nthe settlement prices) of a defined number of sessions. The moving average\nis a lagging indicator. The purpose of the moving average is to indicate the\nbeginning and the ending of a trend. Since the moving average follows the\nmarket, the signals it generates occur after the trend has already changed.\nIt is argued that most traders (or about 70 percent) lose their money in the\nmarkets. If the reason is that most traders focus on moving average values\nthat are predetermined by default settings in their charting software pack-\nages or if they use the media’s favorite 200-day moving average, it’s no won-\nder that people lose. The majority are following the same indicator. \nBEAT THE STREET\nAs Yogi said, “If you want to do better than the average bear, then you have\nto think better than the average bear!” If you want to beat the Street, then\nyou need to think better than the Street—use a different set of values or un-\nderstand how signals are generated. You do not want to follow and trade off\nwhat everyone else is looking at; so when it comes to moving averages, you\nwant to look at a different set of conditions and time periods. Think for a\nminute: If lots of traders are watching for trade signals on 10, 20, and 50 pe-\nriods and if the statement holds true that the majority of traders lose, then\nwhy do you want to trade based off signals on those moving averages?

Some traders and technical ana-\nlysts use various ways to calculate moving averages, such as the simple, the\nweighted, and the exponential. I prefer the simple moving average and a\ndifferent set of values for my moving average, namely the pivot point. \nTHE SIMPLE MOVING AVERAGE\nThe simple moving average (the arithmetic mean) is the most popular mov-\ning average used in technical analysis. The simple moving average is the\nsum of the closing prices over a period of sessions divided by the number\nof sessions. For example, a 10-day moving average would be the sum of the\npast 10 days’ closing prices divided by 10. Each new day would drop the\nfirst day’s closing price and add the new day’s closing price. As new data is\nadded to the calculation, old data is removed. By averaging the price data,\na smoother line is produced, and the trend is much easier to recognize. The\ndisadvantage of the simple moving average is that it only takes into ac-\ncount the time period of the sessions covered in the calculation and that it\ngives equal weight to each day’s price.\nIn Chapters 4 and 5, we covered the pivot point formulas and the sig-\nnificance of pivot points as support and resistance. As you will recall, the\npivot point calculation provides the mean (average) for the session’s trad-\ning range, or high, low, and close: (H + L + C)/3.\nThis moving average section discusses how the moving average helps\nclarify the market’s price flow by extending price analysis over a certain pe-\nriod of time. In this manner, moving averages can accentuate when a mar-\nket enters an extreme condition by how far it departs from the mean. Price\naction either will move toward the moving average or will return to the\nmoving average to retest that level. \nThe “Market Direction” number that was shown in the Excel sheet in\nFigure 5.8 is a combination of the use of price session information (pivot\npoint number) over a period of time (moving average). The market direc-\ntion number utilizes cumulative data from the high, the low, and the close\nfor a session. This information provides a clear picture of the “average true\nprice” for that time period. The market direction number is then calculated\nby taking the average pivot number from the past three periods. Any time\nframe can be utilized to calculate the number. However, the longer the time\nframe, the more significance the number will hold. To calculate the market\ndirection number, add three pivot points from the same session, and divide\nthe sum by three. The purpose of using the pivot point in the moving aver-\nage calculation is that the pivot point will show the continuance of the\ntrend.\nPivot Point Moving Average System\n161\n",

      "text": "Market Direction = Pivot + Pivot + Pivot\n3\nAs stated previously, the market direction number, which is a three-pe-\nriod pivot point moving average, can act as a support number in bullish\nconditions and has a high degree of importance when one of the pivot point\ncalculations for the current session coincides with or is near that number.\nThe market direction number holds true as a resistance number in a bear\nmarket condition. If another number coincides with the market direction\nnumber, such as the actual pivot point or an R-1 (resistance level one)\nnumber, then it would serve as the target high number for that specific time\nperiod. Another way of using the three-period pivot point moving average\nis as a point of reference or fair value. For example, when the market price\ndeparts, or deviates, too far from the mean, then you can use the extreme\nresistance or support number, such as R-2 or S-2  (support level two), or\nthe farthest target number of that direction, as a potential turning point.\nWhen various time frames are incorporated into the analysis (daily,\nweekly, and monthly), there is more certainty that the target price level can\ngenerate the anticipated reaction. If the market gaps too far from the daily\npivot point moving average, use the monthly and/or weekly target support\nand resistance numbers to help identify a targeted reversal support or re-\nsistance point. Figure 6.1 shows a spot foreign exchange (forex) British\npound daily chart with the three-period pivot point moving average over-\nlaid on top of prices. Notice that as the market changes conditions from\nbearish (downtrend) to bullish (uptrend), prices bounce off the moving av-\nerage as a support line and then trade off the moving average as it acts as\na ceiling of resistance. If you notice the price action from November 15 to\nNovember 25, you will see that the market entered a consolidating phase as\nprices moved above and below the moving average. The moving average\nwent virtually in a flat line with a bias to an upside slope. This was hinting\nthat prices were getting ready to change direction. When you watch the\nmoving average in relation to the underlying price action, sometimes you\ncan get clues as to the true market price direction using the pivot point\nmoving average. Due to the weighting of the high, low, and close com-\nbined, the moving average factors in the typical price of that time period,\nthus giving a better gauge of market value. If the close is closer to the high,\nthe average will be at a higher assigned value. Using the three-period pivot\npoint will help you filter out much of the market noise and will give you a\ntruer sense of the market’s fair value within the price range of the past\nthree trading periods.\nAt times, the slope, or angle, of the moving average can give you a clue\nas to the market’s true strength or weakness, especially when combined\n162\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

For added clarity, when combined with identifying a high-probabil-\nity bottom or top-forming candle, you have added confirmation of a poten-\ntial move. \nIn Figure 6.2, the graph shows a representation of a pivot point moving\naverage in a declining trend phase. Then as prices consolidate as the pivot\npoint average measures the typical price rather than the close, we can de-\ntermine what the true market value is and which way prices tend to be\nmoving.

These swings often lead to confusion or\nworse—traders getting whipsawed, causing loss in trading equity.\nPivot Point Moving Average System\n163\nFIGURE 6.1\nUsed with permission of esignal.com.\n",

Eventually, we see a trend reversal, which is\nwhat the direction of the moving average indicated. \nIn Figure 6.3, let’s look at a five-minute chart on the Chicago Board of\nTrade (CBOT) mini-Dow contract. Just to clarify, the minimum tick fluctu-\nation is a one-point move, and every point is worth $5. So the overall con-\ntract value is $5 times the index. If the Dow is at 10500, the contract value\nis $52,500. This may not make sense now, but as you read the book further,\nyou will understand what the low close doji sell signal is about and what the\nspecific rules are for entering on this pattern. For purposes of illustrating\nwhat phase a market goes in and how the pivot point moving average can\nhelp you follow a market, let’s look at the sequence of events:\n• The market develops into a downtrend.\n• At the bottom, a bullish reversal candle pattern forms. \n• Prices start trading wildly, but the moving averages (M/As) are sloping\nhigher.\n• The market reverses and then goes into a sideways channel or consol-\nidating phase. (If you examine the pivot point moving averages, you\nwill see they were pointing higher while prices were in the congestion\nphase.) \n• Prices finally break out and continue the uptrend. \n164\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\nFIGURE 6.2\nMoving average\nwith a higher slope\nindicates a bullish bias.\n",

The three-period pivot point moving average was also flatlin-\ning with an upward slope in the direction of the moving average. Once the\nmarket made a break for it by establishing the uptrend, the average helped\nidentify the trending condition. As the chart illustrates, the pivot point mov-\ning average actually hugs the market’s lows when in an uptrend and the\nhighs in a downtrend.

It is an excellent short-\nterm trading method for highly liquid markets such as forex, for certain fu-\ntures markets, and for stocks that have ample trading volume. One\nvariation of what I use in my trading library with the Genesis Software and\nteach in our Trading Triggers University is the one-period pivot point with\nthe three-period moving average of the pivot point. There are other combi-\nnations you can use, such as a five-period pivot point moving average of the\npivot point with a two-period simple moving average of a close. I test vari-\nous time periods and variables for my parameter settings because of the\nvarious conditions each market has. After all, bonds move differently than\nthe e-mini–Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500, the mini-Dow, the Russell, or the\nNadsdaq does. You may agree that forex currencies move differently than\nindividual stocks. The bottom line is this: I use the two moving average val-\nues to help me identify a shift in momentum of the market; and then as the\nconditions change, such as a close above or below the values of both mov-\ning averages, I use the pivot point filtering method to help me identify a po-\ntential profit target. \nFor the purposes of this book, let me show you how to integrate the\npivot point with the three-period moving average of the pivot point. In\nChapter 5, I disclosed how to filter the pivot support and resistance levels\nby labeling the market condition as neutral, bullish, or bearish. You can also\nchart and track the conditional change of the market by plotting the direc-\ntional change in the two moving average settings. Figure 6.7 shows both\nmoving average values declining; but as the pivot point crosses above the\nthree-period moving averages, it alerts us that the internal market condition\nis changing to bullish. Once both moving averages start to point up and the\npivot point is above the three-period pivot point average the market condi-\ntion confirms we are in a bullish trend. As a general rule, a trader would\nlook to buy from an area of support in a market that is trending upward\n(buy pullbacks).\nFigure 6.8 shows a five-minute chart on the e-mini–S&P 500 futures. In\nthe preopen outcry session around 8:00 A.M. (yes, you can trade preopen\noutcry session), notice that the market is trading sideways and that the\nmoving average values are as well. Then by 8:30 A.M., the market turns\nlower and goes into a congestion phase trading sideways until 9:45 A.M. The\ntall white candle closes above both moving average values and above the\nprior time period’s high (which was a hammer pattern). As the market\nstarts to move in a bullish trend mode, focus on the action of the moving av-\nerages in relation to prices. The pivot point is above the three-period mov-\ning average pivot point; and there are higher highs, higher lows, and higher\nclosing values above both moving averages and past highs. This series of\nconditions continued until after the top was formed by a shooting star at\n10:15 A.M.

Both moving averages\nwere moving in tandem with each other, and the slope of both averages was\npointing in the direction of the trend.\nTRADING TIPS\nThis is an important point, so let me reiterate—What helps indicate the\nstrength of a trend when you use two or more sets of values for your mov-\ning averages are:\n• The slopes of the moving averages are both pointing in the direction of\nthe trend.\n• The moving averages have a good degree of separation or are equidis-\ntant from each other, which indicates a steady trending condition.\n• The moving averages are trending in tangent or are parallel with each\nother, rather than one significantly outpacing the other. \n• If the shorter-term moving average separates or moves too far away\nfrom the longer-term moving average, then there is a potential for an\noverbought condition.

Right now, let’s focus on the moving average components. \nFigure 6.9 is a 5-minute chart on the CBOT mini-Dow looking at the\nsame time period as the e-mini–S&P in Figure 6.8. Notice the coincidence\nfactor as both markets form similar patterns at the same precise moment. I\nbring up this point because it is important that as a day trader you follow\nlike or similar markets to see if there is confirmation throughout the sector.\nBesides, if one market rallies, it is likely that the other market will rally as\nwell. All 30 stocks in the Dow are traded in the S&P 500. Therefore, they\ncan be considered like, or markets that will trade in tandem with each\nother.

It is what I teach students and other\nhighly successful professional traders. \nWhen the price target has been met and the trigger has presented itself,\nenter the trade without hesitation. Do not think about the entry; this is a\nmechanical process. You have already done your homework, and you have\nsatisfied your criteria. Your system is in place, and this is part of the system.\nIf you do not place the trade when the trigger executes and confirms, you\nare not trading according to your plan. Successful traders have the courage\nto act and act promptly. It is important to recognize the immediate envi-\nronment or market condition. Is it up, down, or sideways? After a trend is\nestablished, let’s say a bullish trend, it should consist of higher highs and\nhigher lows; each period should close above the open, and we should see\nhigher closing highs. The pivot point moving average should help verify\nthis condition. In a bearish trend, we would want to see lower highs and\nlower lows; each period should close below the open of each period. Under\nthese circumstances, the pivot point moving average should confirm this\nmarket condition as well. \nTraders need to identify themselves, which will help them  know the\ntime frame to follow in a trending market. Are you a day trader? Are you a\nswing trader who may be in a position that lasts two to five days? Or are\nyou a position trader? Once you acknowledge what your time objective is,\nyou can narrow down your goals and your expectations for the trade. For\nexample, when I am day trading, I will generally be able to identify what the\naverage range for a day is; I will expect that if I miss 20 percent of the bot-\ntom and 20 percent of the top, while waiting for a moving average crossover\nsignal, then I can expect to only capture 60 percent of the average daily\nrange. Perhaps this can be achieved only once or twice a day.\nHOW DO I START?\nFirst, I need to structure my computer and my charts to a format that is\nconducive to day trading. For stock index contracts, I watch two “like” or\n“tandem” markets in two time periods. These are the CBOT mini-Dow and\nthe e-mini–S&P. Lately, due to client requests, I have been alerted to trad-\ning the Russell 2000 and the German stock index Deutscher Aktien Index,\nknown as the DAX. The DAX, an index portfolio of 30 German blue-chip\nstocks, opens at 3 A.M. (ET) and closes at 11 A.M. (ET). (On a side note, as\nof October 2006, the DAX, based in Frankfurt, Germany, will start accept-\ning non-German companies. In order to qualify for the Index, foreign com-\npanies must conduct their operations in Germany.) The DAX 30 actually\ntracks close to moves in the S&P 500 futures.

All my\nchart pages are set up this way; therefore, all chart pages are synchronized\nso that I do not watch different time periods when switching from one\nscreen to another—I have a uniform setting. \n• I find the most reliable day trade signals are confirmed in the 15-minute\ntime frame and triggered in the 5-minute time period as well.\n• When both time frames are in sync with each other and when like mar-\nkets have similar signals, this generates a higher probability trigger.\nAs I stated earlier, the parameters I use in this book are a variation of\nwhat is programmed in my proprietary library with Genesis Software. This\nis a system that generates buy and sell signals based on the principles we\nhave gone over in the book so far.

As you can see, the sell signals when aligned against\nthe pivot point resistance numbers offer a fantastic visual confirmation\nbased on my predefined strategies; therefore, it will help eliminate the emo-\ntional element and impatience of acting on anticipation rather than on a\ntrue signal. \nAll the signals and methods covered in this book can be applied with\nmost charting packages. In fact, 26 years ago, I was calculating the pivot\npoint support and resistance numbers with a handheld calculator. The pivot\npoint calculator is available on my web site.

The difference is that I am going over in detail what the\nspecific signals, settings, and rules are for the trading triggers.\nQ: How long have you been involved in the markets?\nA: I started in the business back in 1979 as a runner on the floor of the\nChicago Mercantile Exchange [CME]. I then worked for George and Carrie\nLane, the innovator and premier educator for the stochastics oscillator.\nBack then, we looked for day trading opportunities in agricultural com-\nmodities, bonds, and foreign currencies.

      "text": "specifically for quick day trading were in the Swiss franc and the German\ndeutsche mark. Floor traders used these numbers and kept them to them-\nselves as a secret formula for their day trading numbers. These are known\nas the pivot point calculations. I started incorporating them in my trading\napproach back in 1984 and have been using them ever since.\nQ: How do you calculate pivot points?\nA: I use the traditional formula. To determine current support/resis-\ntance levels, the first step is to find the pivot point [PP] number: PP = (H +\nL + C) divided by 3\nThe first resistance level (R-1) = (PP × 2) – L \nThe second resistance level (R-2) = PP + H – L\nThe first support level (S-1) = (PP × 2) – H \nThe second support level (S-2) = PP – H + L \nQ: What time frames do you apply to calculate the pivot points?\nA: I find it extremely important to use multiple time frames in my re-\nsearch and analysis. For those who are familiar with the “numbers” from\nthe pivot point calculations, the idea of applying them from any time period\nother than the prior day’s session may make little or no sense. However, I\napply the daily, weekly, and even monthly target numbers and incorporate\nthese in my traders “tool box.” Often traders will comment, “If I am a day\ntrader, why would I want to be concerned with a monthly or a weekly mar-\nket outlook?” Consider that in every month, there will be a high and a low,\nand the close will be somewhere in between. In one week, a high or a low\nwill be established; and in one day of the week, the market will form that\npoint of interest. More often than not, in an hour or so, trades will take\nplace that will establish that high and subsequently that low! \nQ: What are the various time periods in forex markets from which you\ntake the data to calculate the numbers?\nA: For the daily numbers, I take the New York Bank settlement. For\nweekly numbers, I use the data beginning from the open on Sunday night to\nthe close on Friday afternoon. Monthly numbers are calculated by calendar\nperiods.\nQ: What is the main purpose for using the pivot points, and how can\ntraders use them? \nA: One popular application of the pivot point concept is to go long or\ncover any short positions at either of the two support levels or to go short\nor sell at the projected resistance levels. Knowing these fixed price levels\ngives the trader unambiguous points to trade off, to enter, or to exit the\nmarket or, more important at times, where not to enter a position. For ex-\nample, you should not buy right at either of the resistance levels. These lev-\nels act as boundaries that can turn back price advances or declines, at least\non the first attempt. Another technique is to trade the breakout of the first\nsupport or resistance levels. If prices do break through the S-1 or R-1 level,\n182\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

      "text": "traders have a new target at the R-2 or S-2 level to take profits. The benefits\nof using the both short- and longer-term pivot points for a short-term day\ntrader are numerous: They give a trader a better edge due to the ability to\nwork with predetermined price levels, which lead to precise entry and stop-\nloss points, all of which give the trader the additional edge in the quest for\nbigger profits.\nQ: You use different technical tools in your daily videos. On which ones\ndo you put more trust or emphasis?\nA: Great question! I use stochastics as an overbought/oversold indica-\ntor, and I use it to help me determine divergence and convergence signals.\nI use three-period variable moving averages to help keep me focused on the\ntrend. Moving averages also help me identify potential turning points when\nthe short-term average crosses over or below the longer-term average. \nQ: You use candle charts over bar charts. Why is that?\nA: Each candle has different characteristics that represent the differ-\nence, or the distance, between the high, the low, the open, and the close.\nThese characteristics use colors to differentiate the relationship between\nthe open and the close, referred to as the real body. Candlestick charting\nacts as an immediate way to illustrate and to help identify the current mar-\nket’s environment and the current time frame’s acceptance or rejection of\na specific support or resistance level in a clear visual manner. If, for exam-\nple, on a given trading session, prices move higher from the opening price,\nestablish the high, and then fall, the distance formed from those points of\ninterest is called the “shadow.”\nCandle charts give me color and depth, which help me almost immedi-\nately determine where current prices are in relation to past price levels.\nCandlestick charting techniques can be used from data for whatever time\nperiod you are looking at: hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. There are 60 to\n70 different classifications of named candlestick patterns—from one on up\nto several candle components. They can signal reversal, stalled, and con-\ntinuations of a market’s price move. Day traders want to focus on a small\narsenal of the more consistent and reliable reoccurring formations. Several\npatterns that a trader wants to home in on and recognize are the more pow-\nerful reversal formations at tops and bottoms of price ranges. \nQ: How do candlesticks help you in your trading?\nA: My trading approach incorporates time-tested techniques but uses\nthe aid of candlestick charts, which help me identify the true condition of\nthe markets. If you believe market prices are simply the reflection of human\nemotion on perceived current value and focus on what the market is doing,\nrather than on what the market might do, then you are ahead of the crowd\nin understand how markets function. With that understanding, you will\nthen be able to have the confidence to act swiftly and to execute or trigger\ninto a trade or position in the market. \nPivot Point Moving Average System\n183\n",

      "text": "Q: Which do you favor more—fundamental or technical analysis?\nA: I watch what reports are coming out, as some can generate wild gy-\nrations (e.g., monthly unemployment report). I rely heavily on technical\nanalysis. After all, it is the purest and most objective study of price action.\nIt is used for expedience. You can review one, five, ten, or even twenty\ncharts in a matter of seconds or minutes to get a quick overview of the gen-\neral trends. How long would it take to study the fundamental reports on the\neconomy or interest rates in various countries to develop an opinion to buy\nor sell a foreign currency? That process could take hours, days, or even\nweeks to figure out. Specific chart patterns and price actions have a high\ndegree of repetition. They are not 100 percent accurate; however, they do\nhave a high percentage of reoccurrences. Success comes in the simple form\nof managing risk when applying a systematic method to these principles\nand being able to quickly identify when and why a particular pattern fails. \nQ: You learned that certain candle patterns developed near these pivot\npoints. Which ones do you look for near support or resistance levels?\nA: Top reversal or bearish, such as dojis, bearish haramis, harami\ncrosses, dark cloud covers, and evening star formations. And for bottom re-\nversal or bullish candle patterns, I look for bullish haramis, harami  crosses,\nbullish piercing patterns, bullish engulfing patterns, or, my favorite, a rare\noccurring pattern called a morning doji star.\nQ: How significant are doji patterns?\nA: Extremely significant, especially if you know what to look for. There\nare specific criteria that dojis need to meet; but if you know what these are,\nthey can be very powerful in helping your trading decisions. Doji forma-\ntions help confirm reversals. There are different names and nuances asso-\nciated with certain dojis. Dojis indicate indecision, the market ends or\ncloses, where it began or opened. Dojis signify that confidence is lost from\nbuyers or sellers after the open as the market made a lot of intraday noise\nas the range during the day was established. In a bullish or bearish trending\nmarket, indecision is the last thing you want to see. Strong rejection or fail-\nure from the high and/or the low is a significant telltale sign that changes\nare coming.\nQ: What other considerations can you share with us regarding dojis?\nA: In a strong uptrending market, usually the market will close near a\nhigh, as larger capitalized traders will hold positions overnight. If the large\nmoney traders are not confident the market will move higher in price, then\nusually the market closes back near the open. I find it uncanny how many\ntimes dojis form at or very close to the actual pivot point calculated support\nor resistance numbers. That is what helps me set up my trades; it is the re-\nlation of the next candle’s close after a doji that triggers my entries, espe-\ncially if they are lined up at the pivot points.\nQ: What is the shortest time frame that you use for charting?\n184\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

In fact, in my trading course, I teach specific trade setups and\nconfirm signals to trigger or execute trades, how to manage a trade, and\nhow to know when to exit or even reverse a position. \nQ: What signals or rules do you follow for a trading trigger?\nA: Without giving away too many of my trade secrets, there is one that\ncan be found in my advanced trading course—a special trading setup that I\nlook for in a bullish setup.\n• When the market approaches a key pivot point, buy on the close or\non the next open once a new closing high is made above the previ-\nous bullish reversal candle pattern or a doji.\n• Place your initial risk-management stop below the low of the lowest\nlow point of the bullish candle pattern on a stop-close-only basis. \n• Exit the trade on the close or on the first open of a candle that\nmakes a lower low after a prolonged uptrend, especially if it is near\na pivot line. \n• One can use a “filter,” or a back-up process, to confirm the buy sig-\nnal against a major pivot point number, such as a bullish conver-\ngence stochastic pattern. \nRemember, a bullish candle pattern can be a harami, a harami doji\ncross, a bullish piercing pattern, a bullish engulfing pattern, a doji, or a\nmorning doji star.\nQ: Tell us about this course and book you have mentioned?\nA: The book was published by John Wiley and Sons in May of 2004. I\nput the course together based on several seminars I conducted, one of\nwhich was at the Chicago Board of Trade back in May 2003 and then again\nin December 2004. I had a huge response from folks who could not attend\nbut were impressed with my methods. I offer it on my web site, which is\nwww.nationalfutures.com.

Using candlestick\ncharting helps me visually to better compare current price activity in rela-\ntion to past price points of interest. The advantage of using candlestick\ncharting in place of bar charting is that you can use the same techniques\nand analysis that  you do with bar charts and have the diversity and unique\nsignals that candlesticks generate. As you learn this method of charting,\nyou will come to see how it is a great barometer of human emotion, namely,\nfear and greed. \nIn addition, this is a simple, yet certainly more specialized format of\ncharting. It has gained in popularity in the United States and is currently\nfollowed by more and more analysts. My first book covered most of \nthe top formations, and I want to review what I believe are the more fre-\nquent and reliable patterns. This chapter will show some statistical evi-\ndence that there are certain patterns that develop over and over again.\nCandlestick charting is extremely easy to learn; and once you remember\nthe sequence of events that form a trending market condition, the candles\nwill certainly be your best tool in spotting market reversals at tops \nand bottoms.

      "text": "CANDLESTICK CHARTING\nCandlestick charting gives a detailed depiction of a price graph with almost\na three-dimensional effect. What stands out most is that a chartist can see\npatterns more clearly and distinctly than with other types of charts. There\nare over 60 candle patterns that form to create certain setups. This book\nwill focus on only a few select patterns and, what matters most, the triggers\nthat initiate a call to action.\nIf you are not familiar with candlestick formations, I am going over the\nfoundation of how to construct a candle and what it represents. If you wish\nto become an expert at each of the patterns, several authors have written\ngreat books on the subject. One is Steve Nison, who introduced the West-\nern world to candles. (In my first book, on page 44, I wrote about how he\ndiscovered candles.) Others are Steve Bigalow and Greg Morris.\nFor the expert, this section will be a great review. Since each market\nhas a different trading characteristic, such as volatility or price moves, cer-\ntain candlestick patterns vary and may occur more or less frequently. Each\ncandlestick pictured has a different characteristic that represents the dif-\nference or the distance between the high, the low, the open, and the close.\nCandlestick charting techniques can be used from data for whatever time\nperiod you use: hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. Candlestick charts lend\nthemselves to pattern recognition and trendline support, resistance, and\nchannel lines. Candles also help to corroborate other forms of technical\nanalysis, especially pivot point analysis. \nI want to explain the basics, and then I want to show you specific pat-\nterns so you can see for yourself how to utilize them. I will also show a few\nexamples of the more popular named candle formations. Moreover, I will\nexplain the psychology of what is behind creating the pattern as it relates to\nthe open, the high, the low, and the close of a given time period. Armed with\nthe knowledge of which patterns have a higher frequency of occurring and\nwith the understanding of what they symbolize, you should be able to trade\nthe markets from recognizing them; and when patterns do develop, you\nshould be able to instinctively act on the signals, thereby increasing your\nability to make money as a trader. \nThe components of a candlestick are derived from the open, the high,\nthe low, and the close. In Figure 7.1, we see a dark candle (in a color chart-\ning software package, it would be a red candle). This signifies that this par-\nticular time period’s close is below the open. It does not indicate whether\nthe market closed higher or lower than the previous time period did. The\ncomputer code for this sequence would be C < O—the close is less than the\nopen. We can also assign a negative (–) value or reading to help determine\nthe relative strength of a trend. \nIn Figure 7.2, the white, or hollow, candle signifies that the concluded\n188\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

      "text": "time period shows that the close is above the open (in a charting software\npackage, you would universally see this as a green candle). Keep in mind\nthat you can adjust almost any parameter in any software package to your\nliking. Therefore, you may want the candle to be white. The point is that the\ncolor of a “lower close than open” candle should be different from the color\nof the “higher close than open” candle. The computer code for this se-\nquence would be C > O—the close is greater than the open. We can also as-\nsign a positive (+) value or reading to help determine the relative strength\nof a trend by how many more positive, or “higher close than open,” candles\nexist.\nThe three main components of candle charts that we need to identify are:\n1. Relationship between Open and Close (Candle Bodies). With the real\ncandle body colored and representing a negative or a positive reading,\nwe can see what is dominating the market. \nIn uptrends, or bullish market conditions, we see buying come in\non the open; and as we learned from the stochastics indicator, the mar-\nket should settle closer to the highs. It should also close above the\nopen; and that is why in bullish market conditions, we see hollow,\nwhite, or green candles. This is why I assign it a positive (+) reading.\nHow much the bulls are dominating the market is reflected by the\nlength or the distance between the open and the close. If the market\nopens on the low and has a large range where it closes at the high of the\nsession, that signifies that the bulls are in strong control.

      "text": "near where it opened—say, in the middle of the range—that is not a\nsign that bulls dominate the market for that particular time period. \nIn a bearish market condition, or a strong downtrend, we would\nsee dark- or red-colored real body candles. This represents sellers en-\ntering the market on the open and dominating the session right into the\nclose of that time period. If the market opens on the high and prices de-\ncline where the close is at or near the low, this shows that the bears are\nfirmly in control. This is why I assign a negative (–) reading. The dis-\ntance factors between the open and the close are illustrated in a much\nmore defined way in candle charts than in bar charts due to the shape\nand color coordination of the candles. \n2. Shadows and Correlations to Candle Body. The distance of a low\nand/or a high in relation to the real body as created by the open and the\nclose can really illustrate the market’s denial of a support or a resis-\ntance level. Long shadows, tails, or wicks, as they are called, that form\nafter a long downtrend indicate a potential that the trend has exhausted\nitself and that demand is increasing or supply is dwindling. Shadows,\ntails, or wicks formed at the tops of real bodies, especially after a long\nprice advance, indicate that demand is drying up and supply is increas-\ning. The overall size of shadows is important to watch in relation to a\nreal body and can be easily identified.\n3. Size or Length of the Overall Candle. Now this is one that is hard to\nmiss using the color-coded method of candle charts. A long candle that\nopens at the bottom and closes at the high, which would be an abnor-\nmal occurrence, has significant meaning. After a long downtrend, see-\ning this formation indicates that a major trend reversal is taking place.\nAfter a long uptrend, seeing an unusually long candle that closes above\nthe open (a positive value) would indicate that an exhaustion or blow-\noff-top condition may exist. \nThe reverse is true in down trades. After a long price decline, a tall\nred- or dark-colored candle, which represents the market close below\nthe open (a negative assigned value), may indicate that a capitulation\nor an exhaustion bottom has formed. After a long uptrend or price ad-\nvance, if that same candle was formed, it might indicate that a major\ntrend reversal is occurring. \nCANDLE FORMATIONS\nThe candle development will give us immediate identification of the current\nmarket’s environment and the market participant’s acceptance or rejection\nor a support or resistance level in a clearly visual manner.\n190\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

      "text": "The Doji\nThere is a special candle that has no real body to speak of and is called\nthe doji. The close of this candle is at exactly the same price as the close.\nI generally am a little more lenient with this formation; if after a long range\ntrading session the close is less than 8 percent of the overall high and low,\nI consider it a doji. For example, if the Dow has a 100-point trading range\nand the close is within 8 points of the open, I consider it a doji. In curren-\ncies, for example, if the British pound had a 150-point range and the market\nclosed within 12 points of the open, I would consider that a doji formation\n(Figure 7.3). \nDoji formations help confirm reversals. There are different names and\nnuances associated with certain dojis, such as the gravestone, Figure 7.4,\nwhich, when formed after a major downtrend, signals that the trend is near\nan end and that slightly lower prices are expected to come. It is similar in\nappearance to what is called an inverted hammer at market bottoms or a\nshooting star at the top of a prolonged price advance. \nThe dragonfly, Figure 7.5, resembles another candle pattern with \nsimilar implications, which is a hanging man formation.

It has an ex-\ntremely wide range, which heightens the collective market participant’s in-\ndecision. \nThe secret weapon of candlestick charting is knowing the power of\nwhat the doji represents. Dojis indicate indecision—the market ends where\nit began. Confidence is lost from buyers or sellers on the open as the mar-\nket made a lot of noise as the range was established. In a bullish or bearish\ntrending market, indecision is the last thing you want to see. Strong rejec-\ntion or failure from the high and/or low is a significant telltale sign that\nchanges are coming. \nWe use the phrasing of Sir Isaac Newton’s law in the markets an awful\nlot because it really applies to market moves: “A body in motion tends to\nstay in motion until a force or obstacle stops or changes that motion.” I be-\nlieve and teach that the doji represents that force: It generally stops or\nchanges the motion or momentum due to the uncertainty or indecision that\nis created at peak and troughs. \nIn a strong uptrending market, usually the market will close near a\nhigh, as larger-capitalized traders will hold positions overnight. If the large-\nmoney traders are not confident the market will move higher in price, then\nusually the market closes back near the open. If large-capitalized traders\nlose confidence, then it is best to wait before making a trading decision,\nright? Well, that is the indecision that forms a doji. \nDojis help form two- and three-candle formations that can develop into\nmore powerful and trustworthy signals once identified. A few of these for-\nmations are morning doji star, the evening doji star, and the bullish and\nbearish harami doji crosses, which are discussed later in this chapter.\nWith each of these patterns, we need to see a specific sequence of events\nfor these patterns to develop, such as a gap lower open and a gap higher\nopen than a previous close.

When a hammer appears at the top of an uptrend, the name\nchanges to a “hanging man” and indicates that a top is near. There are\nthree main characteristics that a pattern needs in order to qualify. \n1. The real body is at the upper end of the trading range; the color\n(white or black) is not important.\n2. The lower part, or the “shadow,” should be at least twice the length\nof the real body.\n3. It should have little or no upper shadow, like a shaved head candle. \nAfter a long decline, if a hammer forms on higher or increased vol-\nume, this adds to the certainty that a capitulation low has occurred.\nHammers can be created both by a closing below the open, which\nwould be assigned a negative change value (shown in Figure 7.8), and\nby a higher close than the open, which would be assigned a positive\nchange value (shown in Figure 7.9).\n194\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\nFIGURE 7.8\nFIGURE 7.9\nHammer\nHammer\n",

During the beginning stages of an advancing price\ntrend, an unusually long white candle is preceded by three smaller dark\ncandles. Again, it can even be just two candles, but the textbook ver-\nsion is that three smaller candles need to stay within the range of the\nfirst long white candle.

The tweezer top\nforms after an uptrend and then two consecutive time periods making\nequal highs. This signals that there is strong resistance and a short-\nterm top is in place. One variation is that the first period usually con-\nsists of a long body candle with a higher close than open (positive). \nThe second day is usually a small real-body candle that has a high \nequal to the prior day’s high. It can be a positive or a negative open\nclose relationship; but it is more consistent and a better signal that a re-\nversal is forming when the second candle’s color is the opposite of the\nfirst candle’s color.

Pete came to a seminar I was giving on Advance Trad-\ning Tactics for forex markets in Houston in January 2006. It is interesting\nthat, at the time, I was unaware of his preliminary test results when he of-\nfered to share them with the audience. In fact, he had thought that he ran\nthe test wrong when the results popped up, so he ran it three times. Pete\nran the test from the preceding 255 trading days on a 15-minute time period\nfor each market. Because there are about 255 trading days in an average\nyear, I felt this was a pretty good sample of information. Most people want\nto see longer-term studies; for some applications and specific studies, that\nmay be a novel idea. However, I would say the markets in 2005 generated\nenough volatility, with macroeconomic and geopolitical events combined\nwith the Federal Reserve tightening interest rates. Moreover, energy prices\nwere on the move; and we were faced with global terrorist attacks, such as\nthe heinous bomb blast in London that shocked the world in mid-July 2005.\nThat event sent a tremendous price shock to global equity markets. In ad-\ndition, there are more independent online traders and a new crop of super-\ntraders known as hedge funds trading in the markets. So with these\nvariables and market influences, I would say 2005 was a good representa-\ntion of a more modern historic test period for determining what influenced\nmarket prices. \nA 10-year back study would not take into account the more active on-\nline trading vehicles or the popular spot foreign currency markets. Even if\nthis were a 2-, 5-, or 10-year study, risk disclosure and the government still\nwould require me to state that past price history is not indicative of future\nresults. So, my study was a back-test study to determine the validity of find-\ning out if dojis, hammers, and shooting stars were really forming at major\nturning points or were making the actual highs or lows in the more active\nday trading markets and how often. Here are the parameters Pete and I\nused to determine the back test and the results of the findings: If a doji is\nwithin three ticks of the low, we count it. It could be the low itself, or it\ncould be within one, two, or three ticks of the low. In the same sense, we\nwill include when a shooting star is within three ticks of the high. To create\na percentage, we take the number of days when we are within three ticks of\nthe low and divide that by 255. \n204\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

We also found that the hammer pattern was\nwithin three ticks of the low 36 percent of the time on bonds. We added the\ntwo pattern totals together and found that hammers and dojis formed the\nlow on bonds 88 percent of the time, either making the exact high or com-\ning within three ticks. We must keep in mind that there are many days that\nhave multiple dojis or hammer patterns. \nSome days may have four doji patterns where only one of these doji\npatterns formed the low, while the other three gave false signals. For gold,\nwe used four ticks. For e-mini–Standard & Poors (S&P) 500, we used four\nticks (each tick is 12.50, so four ticks is one full point).

There are many arguments on\nwhen the day ends and begins. For our analysis in calculating pivot points,\nI established that the forex trading day ends with the New York Bank clos-\ning at 5 P.M. Eastern time. From a market time period to run a study as to\nwhat makes a high or a low, I needed a rigid sample test period with accu-\nrate and stable data. We wanted to find the highs and the lows of the day\nbased on trades and real trades. Forex data is not exchange based. Each\nbroker has his or her own set of data. Although the data is parallel to the\nthat of the futures, as we discussed in Chapter 1 (known as the basis), they\nare not trades; instead, they are bids/asks. \nTo get a taste for the true highs and lows of the day from a centralized\nmarket place that had actual time-stamped transactions (time and sales\ndata), we used the futures markets open outcry session, which is from \n7:20 A.M. until 2 P.M. Central time. This eliminates the possibility of the true\nlow being an extra few ticks away on the real exchange markets.

Each market has its own character. The\nCanadian dollar, for example, is a currency that highly correlates to com-\nmodities, which would be a good reason why it has a strong percentage of\noccurrences versus the British pound. The Canadian dollar tracks closer to\nthe moves in gold. In addition, the volume of trading is lower as compared\nto the British pound, the euro, or the yen, according to the Triennial Cen-\ntral Bank Survey 2004. While most currencies are tradable, the five curren-\ncies, including the U.S. dollar (four currency pairs), that represent the\nmajority of foreign exchange trading volume are the euro (EUR/USD), with\nthe majority of volume of 28 percent; the yen (USD/JPY), with estimated 17\npercent  of market share; the British pound (GBP/USD), with 14  percent;\nand the Swiss franc (USD/CHF), with an estimated 5 percent share of over-\nall volume activity. The Canadian dollar volume trades comparatively\nspeaking about less than 4 percent.\nThere are those who will take these statistics and show that there is no\nevidence that it is reliable information or that there was not enough back-\ntest studies completed. In fact, statisticians and those who understand\nBayesian calculations will most likely dispute these findings. Well that’s al-\nright, as I see these patterns form over and over and over; and the computer\nfindings substantiate that. In case you wanted to know what Bayesian the-\nory is, it is from the famous mathematician Thomas Bayes. He was born in\nLondon in 1702 and died in 1761. One of the few works Bayes published\nduring his lifetime was a defense of Issac Newton against a bishop who had\nattacked the logic of his calculus, according to the Encyclopedia Britan-\nnica. Bayes was successful enough as a mathematician to win election to\nthe Royal Society of London. He would have been long forgotten had it not\nbeen for his friend Richard Price, who inherited Bayes’s papers. Price, him-\nself famous for devising one of the first actuarial tables, came across the\n“Essay towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances” and helped\ndevelop the Bayes rule. Statisticians have long recognized the rule’s im-\nportance, and some high school classes use it to solve straightforward\nprobability problems. But once both data and beliefs enter the picture, the\nmath can become unbelievably complex. Over the past 10 or 15 years, how-\never, computers have become powerful enough to handle Bayesian calcu-\nlations with relative ease; and the method has won a following. Bayes’s\nformula allows scientists to combine new data with their prior beliefs\nabout how the world works. It is an idea that amounts to heresy in much of\nthe statistical world. After all, the method requires individuals to make sub-\njective decisions about how strongly to weigh prior beliefs.

In\nother words, it allows scientists to combine new data with their existing\nknowledge or expertise. \nThis rule applies to the statistics provided on hammers and dojis \nforming bottoms, as in the case of the Canadian dollar, saying “40 percent\nof bottoms are hammers” is not equivalent to saying “40 percent of ham-\nmers are bottoms.” The Bayes rule can be used to connect these two state-\nments. Therefore, you must be aware that what happened in the past might\nnot repeat with the same frequency or that this data is even reliable. How-\never, the facts are the facts.

Once my trading concepts are taught by the masses, I do not be-\nlieve the signals will be diluted or absorbed in the marketplace. \nI believe not every trader will implement my methods in exactly the\nsame way as I do. For example, Larry Williams has his OOPS method, Mark\nFishers has his method, and Tom Demark had his method let out to the pub-\nlic. And all these systems, to my knowledge, are still highly effective strate-\ngies. So I do not believe letting you into my “black box” will hurt or dilute\nthe signals. \nThere are various markets and various time periods in which to enter a\ntrade, such as a 60-minute, a 15-minute, and a 5-minute time period for\nswing and day traders. These signals work for futures and stocks, and they\nwork amazingly well in the foreign exchange (forex) markets, as you will\nsee in the coming examples. The premise is to help keep the trader focused\non the now, to watch and study the current price action. The candle pat-\nterns give a visual confirmation of price momentum, and the pivot points\nforewarn you of what the potential turning points are. When you combine\nthe two methods, you have a solid trading program. This setup may help\nyou improve your trading performance and allow you to develop a consis-\ntently winning trading strategy. This could be your personal trading system\nthat is based off proven and powerful techniques. For a moment, I want you\nto envision the concept of epoxy glue: It requires two compounds. Sepa-\nrately, they are not very reliable or, in fact, a very strong bonding substance.\nHowever, when combined, a chemical reaction occurs and forms an amaz-\ningly strong and powerful bond. Using the methods of candlesticks with\npivot points can give you that same result if you know what to look for. The\nimplementation of longer-term analysis using pivot points will give a trader\na fantastic means by which to anticipate a point where a trend change\ncould occur, thus helping a trader not only to prepare but also to act on a\ntrade opportunity. One can implement this setup using different time\nframes besides daily analysis. You can include weekly and even monthly\npivot point calculations. This method of analysis will alert you well in ad-\nvance of a potential support and/or resistance level. In the setup process,\nyou will heighten your awareness to enter in a long or a short position\nagainst predefined levels and will wait for the trigger or market signal at\nthose levels. It can not only help you define or identify the target area to\nenter but also establish your risk objective. Another event that occurs with\nthis setup process is that you now can set up your orders to buy on your\ntrading platform with the selected contract amounts—in other words, pre-\narrange the commands on the electronic order ticket. Now all you need is\nconfirmation so you can pull the trigger or click the mouse to establish an\nentry in the market and establish a position.\nIn Chapter 7, we covered the importance of dojis and the statistical rel-\n214\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

In\ncandle patterns, the morning doji star is one of the most reliable reversal\nformations that a trader can identify. The problem is that there are about 12\nvariations, making it hard to write code to program in a trading software\npackage. However, the main component about the doji is the trigger indi-\ncating when the next time period’s close is higher than the doji’s high. This\ncan be a subtle change by just two PIPs in forex or ticks in futures. It can-\nnot be at the exact high of the doji; rather, it needs to close above the doji\nhigh. This is a very important point, so make sure you are crystal clear on\nit. Figure 8.1 demonstrates the definition of a close above the doji high.\nHIGH CLOSE DOJI\nThe most reliable and most common method used to determine support\nand resistance levels is the mathematical-based calculations from pivot\npoint analysis. Through the years, I have noticed that doji formations form\nmore often than not at these predefined levels. In Chapter 7, we have sta-\ntistical information that backs up that observation. That is the focus on\nwhich we want to concentrate—the market’s behavior at support and re-\nsistance levels, especially when dojis appear. The key is to watch for con-\nfirmation for a transition to take place and to act when there is a shift in\nmomentum. We are looking for a specific conditional change to take place\nin the market, namely a higher closing high above a doji’s high at the pivot\npoint support level. This is the pattern I call the high close doji (HCD)\nSetups and Triggers\n215\nFIGURE 8.1\n",

It is a simple and basic\napproach to candlestick chart patterns that is a high-probability winning\nstrategy.\nCharacteristics\nWhen the market is in an extended trend to the downside and the market\ncondition is oversold, a doji appears, indicating indecision and weakness of\nsellers to maintain the downward trend. In addition, prices are near a pro-\njected pivot point support target level (Figure 8.1). \nWhen a doji appears, you should:\n• Buy on the close or on the next open after a new closing high is made\nfrom the previous doji candle high, especially when the market is\nagainst a key pivot point support target number. \n• Place stops below the lowest low point of the doji. Stops should be ini-\ntially placed as a stop-close-only, meaning you do not exit the trade un-\nless the market closes back below the doji’s low. \n• Sell or exit the trade on the close or on the next open of a candle that\nmakes a lower closing low near a key pivot point resistance number. \nYou can use a “filter” or backup process to confirm the buy signal, such\nas a bullish convergence stochastic pattern or a bullish convergence on\nmoving average convergence/divergence (MACD).\nSpot Forex Triggers\nNow let’s put these rules into practice by examining active trading markets,\nsuch as in foreign currency markets. Figure 8.2 shows a 15-minute time pe-\nriod candle chart on the spot British pound. Taking the data from Septem-\nber 29 and using the close from the 5 P.M. (ET) New York Bank settlement,\nwe have a high of 177.04, a low of 175.92, and a close of 176.13. Once we cal-\nculate the pivot points, we have the first support (S-1) figured as 175.68.\nThe first resistance (R-1) is 176.80.\nAs you can see, the market trades for almost two hours at the pivot sup-\nport; but at 4:30, a doji forms. Three time periods later, a close above the\ndoji’s high occurs. Note that the market closes above both moving average\nvalues. In addition, the COMAS (Conditional Optimized Moving Average\nSystem™) method shows the shorter-term moving average cross above the\nlonger-term average, confirming a trigger to go long. The trigger to enter a\nlong position would be on the time period’s close or the very next session’s\n216\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

The HCD trigger signals to enter in a position earlier than the\nMACD does and is confirmed by the stochastics as the %K and %D both\nclose above the 20 percent line. What helps keep you in the trade is the se-\nquence of trading events, such as higher highs, higher lows, and higher clos-\ning highs. Note that the %K and %D stochastic readings do not close\nbeneath the 80 percent level until the end of the trend run. Also note that\nonce the market closes below a prior time period’s low and a doji forms at\nthe top of the price peak, the stochastics does cross beneath and closes\nbelow the 80 percent line. The MACD also signals a zero-line cross. All the\nindicators lined up with an exit point.\nThis signal generated a buy at 119.06.

If the market is to go into trend mode, which in this ex-\nample it did, we should see the sequence of events unfold, such as higher\nhighs, higher lows, and higher closing highs. As a day trader, your exit is at\nthe least to be calculated by the end of the day; but until the market makes\nthe first lower closing low near a key resistance level, you stay with the po-\nsition or at least scale out of partial positions at the first sign of a pause in\nthe trending condition.\nThe long would be entered at 530.50, and the offset was triggered at\n538. That would be a $7.50 move per contract and would equate to $250 per\ncontract.\nThe example in Figure 8.5 is on a five-minute chart. We see confirma-\ntion of an HCD trigger with the fast stochastics closing back above the 20\npercent line. Here we have the same feature with higher highs, higher lows,\nand higher closing highs.

You initially placed a stop-close-only; but for an intraday\ntime period, this would have been a mental stop-close-only because most\norder platforms do not have that feature for day trading. As the market has\nmoved in your favor, you can place a hard stop above the doji high. There\nwill be times when you have to make a judgment on whether the risk is too\nexcessive by the distance of the proposed entry and the stop-close-only.\nTherefore, you may want to scale out of two-thirds of a position at the first\nsign you see the trend lose momentum. \nSpot Forex Triggers\nLet’s examine market price action and how to execute this signal.

Now we can\nmake a decision instead of placing a hard stop above the initial doji high.\nWe could decide, since the move was a decent distance away from our ini-\ntial entry, to place a stop at breakeven on the balance of our position. As the\nmarket enters a consolidation phase, we see that prices never close above\nthe high of the first reactionary low’s high. That keeps prices contained in\na sideways channel, which is similar to a bear flag formation. As we follow\nthe flow of the market, notice how the market declines by the end of the\nday to the S-2 of 117.80. As a day trader, there is no question on where you\nneed to exit the position. It is the end of the day, and you have managed a\ntrade all day and rode a very nice trending market condition. \nUsing a half-position scale-out method, you obviously need to trade at\nleast a minimum of two contracts.

That is just three PIPs above the daily\npivot point resistance level, too. \nAgain, what we want to see is almost instant follow-through for the\nprice to decline. As you can see with this trade, there was immediate fol-\nlow-through. Notice the progression of the market as it declines from the\nentry price at 118.07 straight down to 117.87, for a quick 20-PIP gain. The\nmarket then trades back and forth, creating small-range candles, which\nform a sideways channel. If you look carefully at each candle’s close, you\nwill see that it does not close back above the high of candle that established\nthe first reactionary low. As a trader, you may want to hold all positions at\nthis time or at least cover half of your positions for small gain. One reason\nto do that is because, as powerful and reliable as these triggers are, we still\ndo not know how far prices can or will actually move. Remember that the\npatterns recur; the outcome is what is different each time.\nThe markets could easily reverse back and challenge the highs. By tak-\ning money out of the market immediately on half of your positions, you\nhave profits; and more important, you reduce your risk exposure in \nthe market. \nAlways remember that every time you are in the market, you face risk.\nSo by establishing a profit and following the flow of the market, you can\nmanage the balance of your trade with less stress, knowing you have made\nmoney. See how the candles in Figure 8.18 show the true direction of the\nmarket: The dark candles reflect closes below the open. For the most part,\nthere are more of the dark, or negative assigned, candles, which are estab-\nlishing lower closing lows, than there are white, or positive assigned, can-\ndles. Not only do they have smaller ranges, but they do not make higher\nclosing highs. This shows that every time the market rallies just a little bit,\nsellers are present. Long real-body, or negative assigned, candles represent\nsellers, who dominate this market. Therefore, staying short on the balance\nof the position is warranted. Now, as the market price disintegrates,\ndemonstrating the conviction of sellers, we can place a hard stop at\nbreakeven on the balance of the position and start to adjust the stop to pro-\ntect profits accordingly. This is what managing the trade is about and what\nwe will go over in Chapter 9. \nAs a short-term trader, it is imperative to trade with the current flow or\nmomentum of the market. Because there are so many variables that can in-\nfluence your trading decisions, using the methods described here will help\nyou keep focused and will alleviate the problem of trading on emotional\nimpulses. \nWhen you are armed with what the potential resistance levels are, then\nonce you identify a low close doji signal and then apply trade management\ntechniques, you can certainly increase your chances to consistently capture\n234\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

This is a sign that the negative momentum, or selling pressure, is\nfading and that it is time to exit your position.

If you have the discipline to trade by a set of rules and to\nfollow those rules, you will reap some juicy trading profits consistently\nover a long period of time.\nTriggers on Futures Markets\nLet’s look at implementing a confluence of pivot points and see how the\nmarket behaves at these longer-term resistance projections. In Figure 8.20,\nwe have the daily, weekly, and monthly numbers all concentrating near 115\nin the bonds. This chart is a 5-minute time period that illustrates again why\nit is important to look for sell signals at resistance and for buy signals at\nsupport. \nMany traders fail to see the bigger picture and get caught up in the ex-\ncitement of a trending market condition. As prices trade above the daily R-\n2 pivot point, some traders look at their R-3 numbers and think they are on\na “cash cow” train ride that will never stop climbing higher. By examining\nthe higher-degree time periods, such as the weekly and monthly numbers,\nyou can get a better idea that the market may soon run out of steam as there\nis hidden resistance from longer-term pivot analysis. Practicing discipline\nby not following the herd mentality and demonstrating patience to wait for\na sell signal will lead to a more fruitful opportunity. \nAs you can see, once the market closes below the double doji forma-\ntions triggering a short position, the moving averages cross and the market\ncloses below both values. Once again, here is the market reaction as bulls\nscramble to sell out their longs. The trigger to sell short was 11428⁄32, and the\nmarket plunged to 11415⁄32, for a quick 13⁄32-point decline (each point is $31.25),\nor a gain of nearly $400 per position. Notice how the market pauses or con-\nsolidates forming a bear flag. Here is where tightening your stops and cov-\nering half or two-thirds of your positions would again come into action and\nbe a wise and profitable decisison. \nThe LCD signal works on most active markets, as long as there is\nvolatility and price movement.

If the markets outlined here have both a high fre-\nquency and a strong tendency to form tops and bottoms by the developing\ndoji candle and if you learn to wait for that specific setup and act on a trig-\nger rather than guessing or anticipating when a market is ready to turn, you\nmay see a significant improvement in your trading results. \nTriggers on Stocks\nIn Chapter 1, I gave an example of how an exchange traded fund may not\nreact as much or at all compared to a stock in that group or sector. One\nsuch stock I showed was in Figure 1.15—Toll Brothers. If you broke that\nmonthly chart down to a weekly and then a daily time frame and used the\ncombination of the techniques taught so far with pivot point analysis in con-\njunction with these specific candle patterns, you would have been alerted\nto a top in the market in the summer of 2005. \nWhy don’t traders act on these signals? Most traders do not realize\nwhat pivot point calculations are and how the markets react to them. The\nresistance target levels are “hidden,” meaning you cannot see a projected\nhigh because it is not drawn from a past chart pattern; rather, it is derived\nfrom a mathematical calculation. This gives a projected price expansion on\na measured-increase based on the previous time period’s range according\nto the pivot point formula. Using the monthly pivot point method, taking\nthe trading data for Toll Brothers from June would have helped predict the\nhigh for July. Figure 8.25 shows the Pivot Point Calculator with the high,\nthe low, and the close from the month of June. Notice that the R-2 target\nnumber was 58.12. The exact high in July was 58.67!\nThe chart in Figure 8.26 illustrates the low close doji trigger. In addi-\ntion, we had the moving averages cross over, and prices traded beneath\nboth moving averages to help confirm that the market had lost its bullish\nmomentum. \nTo some traders, the tall white candle at the top may have appeared to\nlook like a buying opportunity, especially as the market made a slight cor-\nrection. The low close doji against the longer-term monthly pivot point re-\nsistance told a different story. Identifying the doji at or near a pivot point is\na great guideline to alert you almost every time that there is a potential\nprice change or reversal coming.

In Chapter 7, we identified the frequency or the percentage of\ntimes over a course of the year on a 15-minute time interval when the ham-\nmer candle pattern formed at or near the low of a given day. The jackham-\nmer, however, develops in the middle to the end of the trading session.\nUsually immediately following the hammer is a bullish candle, or a mara-\nbuzo, a tall green positive (+) assigned candle.\nWhat specifically describes the jackhammer? The jackhammer pattern\nis a hammer candle, but it occurs in the middle to the end of a trading ses-\nsion. I call it “the search and destroy” stop-loss order pattern. The general\nmarket characteristics of this pattern starts off with the market establish-\ning a low, then consolidates or trades sideways for a bit, and then without\nwarning sells off abruptly. It is generally that particular sell-off that creates\na hammer pattern. Therefore, anyone who had intraday stops too close,\nunder what is considered the primary low for the day, got “bagged and\ntagged.” In other words, stop-loss orders were elected, and longs were\njacked out of their positions and money—as in hit over the head with a billy\nclub and “jacked” (robbed).\nTrading Rules Defined\nThe jackhammer formation is an extremely powerful intraday reversal for-\nmation that requires immediate action to enter a long position.

The\nelectronic markets offer retail traders a competitive advantage because\nthey can use a home computer with a DSL or a broadband connection to in-\ntegrate charting software packages and equal access to markets. The stock\nindex futures contract, such as the mini-Dow contract, has what technical\nand fundamental traders need: News-driven events and other technical\ntrading market participants both provide volatility and liquidity. Many of\nthe chart examples contained in these pages are a great representation of\nan average day’s trading patterns. That’s not to say the other stock index\nmarkets, such as the e-mini–S&P and the Russell, perform differently; they\ninteract extremely well with each other. In fact, at times I may have a trig-\nger in the mini-Dow and take the trade in the S&P, and vice versa. Most\ntimes, when the Dow gives me a trigger, that is the market I will trade in.\nConsider that the e-mini–S&P have an influence from the tech sector. Dow\nat times may or may not have a similar dollar value move as the S&P. Both\nmarkets are great day trading vehicles, as is the Russell. The Dow more\ntimes than not has more distinct trading signals; for that reason, I have il-\nlustrated these setups with using the Dow. \nAs another example of spotting a jackhammer pattern, look at Figure\n8.32, which is another 5-minute chart in the Dow. Here you see the sec-\nondary low bounce right off a pivot point support; and as the white or pos-\nitive assigned values show, the candles’ closes are above the opens and\nwhat is indicated immediately after the hammer forms. Notice the immedi-\nate reaction of the market as the sequence of higher highs, higher lows, and\nhigher closing highs occurs. You can also see confirmation of the buy sig-\nnal with the moving averages crossing over and with the second candle\nafter the hammer is formed—it closes above both moving average values.\nThis is the confirmation that should give you the confidence to maintain a\nlong position. The stop is initially placed below the hammer’s low. This\nshould not be a stop-close-only as this setup should see an immediate pos-\nitive reaction. The trigger to go long here was at 10935; the first sign that\nthe bullish drive lost momentum was the lower closing low at 10965, which\nresulted in a quick 30-point gain.\nThere are times when we see this pattern late in the trading session.\nBut keep in mind that the CBOT Dow contract trades continuously until 4\n248\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

Prior to entering a trade, you\nshould have your “pregame” setup, complete with your market analysis and\nrules for entering a trade. Certain rules should start with the techniques\ncovered in this book so far, which include:\n• Identifying what the market condition is—overbought or oversold bull-\nish, bearish, or neutral.\n• Identifying the levels that the pivot points lines are at, using the various\ntime frames—monthly, weekly, and daily periods.\n• Setting up your charting software parameters with these specific  pivot\npoints moving average values.\n• Experimenting with variation settings on your own.\nThen you need to watch and identify when and at what price points the\ndojis, hammers, and shooting stars develop.

The descriptions of the types of stops and the pros and cons of each\nshould help you make the right decision for the various circumstances or\nmarket conditions. \nPLACING STOP ORDERS\nStop orders are often referred to as a protection method against losses.\nThese orders can also be placed to enter positions. Specifically, a stop\norder is an order that you place either through a broker or online. If the\nmarket trades at a certain price, then the order is triggered and becomes a\nmarket order to be filled at the next best available price. The general rules\nof stop placement are: \n• Buy stops are placed above the current market price. \n• Sell stops are placed below the current market price. \nGENERAL USES OF STOP ORDERS\nThis chapter will focus on protective stops used to offset a position and to\nprotect against losses and against accrued profits. You can also use a stop\nto enter a position. There are a variety of stops that can be used depending\non your situation, the market you are trading, and what you are trying to ac-\ncomplish. There are various types of available stops and several techniques\nthat can be used with these stops to help you manage your position and re-\nduce your overall risk.\n• Dollar Limits. Stops can be based on a dollar amount per position.\nThe dollar amount is categorized under money management for trading\nsystems. If you are risking $250 per futures contract in an e-mini–\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) contract, then your stop level would be\nplaced at a five-point distance from your entry price.

      "text": "used less frequently by professional traders because it has no relevancy\nto a mechanical trading model, especially systems that are in the mar-\nket all the time, such as a moving average system. However, there are\nbenefits to this feature with setting a daily dollar amount on a loss limit\nfor active day traders. Some electronic order platforms allow you to set\na daily loss limit. Rather than per trade, it sets an overall loss limit on\nyour account. \n• Percentage Figures. Most traders hear of using a stop of a certain per-\ncentage of the overall account size. Generally speaking, that number\ncan be 2 percent up to as much as 5 percent of the overall account. Un-\nfortunately for most traders in futures or foreign exchange (forex) mar-\nkets, the average size trading account is $10,000, which means the stop\nis $200 to $500 dollars per trade. This leaves little room for error. Nor-\nmally, you want to use at least a two-to-one risk/reward ratio on your\ntrades. So if you risk 5 percent on a $10,000 account, you should expect\nto risk $500 and make $1,000 per trade.\n• Time Factors. After a specific time period, if the price does not move\nin the expected direction or if the velocity of such a move does not war-\nrant holding onto the position, then exit the trade. If you see a low\nclose doji (LCD) or a high close doji (HCD) signal, it is my experience\nthat the market generally demonstrates an immediate reaction within\ntwo or four time periods. After a long period of the market not re-\nsponding to this type of signal, liquidate the position. The timing of the\ntrade did not correspond with the historical tendency and did not gen-\nerate the desired results in a given period. \nAnother consideration in the art of placing stops using a time ele-\nment is the aid of a moving average. A moving average is simply a\ntrend line that is considered a time-driven price-directional tool. One\ntime factor that one can use as a stop placement method is the\ncrossover point of reference created when using two moving average\nvalues. Once the shorter-term moving average crosses the longer-term\nmoving average, it reflects a value change in the market. In Figure 9.1,\nonce the market triggers a signal to go long with the high close doji,\ncombining a close below doji low and the crossover point (using both\nthe one-period pivot point and the three-period pivot point moving av-\nerages) can act as a stop placement level. Once again, you would want\nto look at the point of crossover of the two moving average values; and\nif the market closes below the low of the doji’s low and the moving av-\nerage (M/A) values, then a trigger to exit the position would be war-\nranted. As you can see, a bullish trend develops with the golden\nsequence of events: higher highs, higher lows, and higher closing highs.\nThe stop-loss was placed at a critical point.\n• Price Levels.

Statistics\nthat are often used are the mean, the standard deviation, and the co-\nefficient of variation. The best trailing-stop approach has been ex-\nplored by many technicians. The various methods include placing a\nstop using a set price amount, which could be as much as 50 percent of\nthe average true range of a given time period, either above or below the\n10- or 20-day moving average. \nWhy is this an important method? If you place a stop near a specific\nchart point of interest, such as an old high or an old low, that level is\nobvious to every chart watcher. Markets do “test” and penetrate from\ntime to time those levels. If you set your stop too close, such as setting\na sell stop below an old low point or a buy stop above an old price high,\nchances are that your order may be executed if it is too close, such as\nwhat the jackhammer or shooting star represents. So generally, a cer-\ntain factor or distance should be calculated for your stop placement.\nSince most traders believe a market has reached a peak, they will place\n260\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\nFIGURE 9.1\nUsed with permission of esignal.com.\n",

Figure 9.2 shows an example of when\nthe market is at a major turning point, how a price spike occurs. You\nmay want to take the average daily range of the most recent 10 or more\nperiods and then use a factor between 20 percent and 50 percent of the\n10-day average daily range. When entering a short position you would\nuse a protective buy stop based on a percentage above the 10-day av-\nerage range.

By using 120 percent of\nthe average of the last 10-day period range, this method would accom-\nplish the goal of not getting stopped out. Realistically, that may be way\ntoo much risk for an individual trader. But examine the risk/reward\nratio on that particular trade. A risk of 150 percent of the average daily\nrange from the most recent 10-day period would have been 261 PIPs.\nThe stop would be placed above the high on October 25 at 181.30. The\nlow was at 170.65, made nearly one month later on November 22.\nGranted, depending on your risk tolerance, this may seem excessive;\nbut you can select and back-test any percentage variable of an average\ndaily range stop placement. \nThe key idea here is to keep your stops out of harm’s way. If a\ntrade is to become profitable, there should be signs, such as in the case\nof selling short, that you see immediate results with lower highs, lower\nlows, and lower closing lows. Even in the days where we see spike\nhighs or spike lows, notice where the market closes in relation to their\nrespective highs and lows. The price penetrates the highs but closes\nback below the prior highs. The reverse is true at the spike lows. This\nis a good clue that the market has exhausted a trend and is ready to re-\nverse. Keeping a stop out of harm’s way will allow you to participate in\nthe move using a variation of an average daily range stop placement. \n• Conditional Changes. A conditional change is defined as a higher\nclosing high in a downtrend or a lower closing low in an uptrend. Such\nas the case with a spike top, the market does not close above an old\nhigh. Therefore, one factor such as the stop-close-only order will be of\ngreat use to a trader not looking to get bumped out of a position. There\nis, as with any stop, the unknown risk that there is not a guaranteed\nprice at which your stop order will be filled. This order has a negative\nconnotation among traders because it spells too much risk. A buy stop\nwill be elected and will knock you out of a position if the market closes\nabove the stop price; and a sell stop will be elected and will knock you\nout of your position if the close is below your selected price level. The\nunknown is how far away the market will close from the selected stop\nprice. The key benefit in using a stop-close-only order is that it keeps\nyour risk defined to a conditional change and helps you from getting\nknocked out of a position from intraperiod volatility. Stop-close-only\norders (SCOs) are for end-of-day trading and can be placed on most\ntrading platforms. The SCOs can be used for day trading; however, they\nmust be used manually, as most platforms do not accept intraday\nSCOs. Some consider these mental stops, which are predefined risk\nfactors.

A trader\nneeds to have a strict disciplinary approach.\nThe challenge in selecting the right stop is to reduce risk while not\nbeing shaken out of the trade by market volatility. It is important to try\nto maximize your trading results and to stay in profitable trades as long\nas possible. Employing random stop-losses and profit targets can ruin\na trading strategy, making it perform significantly worse than it would\nhave otherwise. One successful method is to use trailing stops that\nadapt to market volatility so that the stop is placed far enough away,\nwhich combines enough sensitivity to price changes with flexibility to\nfit your risk/reward parameters. Using this combination may provide\nprofitable consistency from a stop-placement aspect for the intermedi-\nate-term trader. The trailing stop is used as an attempt to lock in some\nof the paper profits that could accrue should the market move in the di-\nrection desired. Like an ordinary stop, the trailing stop is started at\nsome initial value but then is moved up (in a long trade) or down (in a\nshort trade) as the market moves in your favor. \nTesting has demonstrated that a proper combination of even simple\nexit methods, such as placing a stop below the low of the prior past two\ntrading sessions, can substantially improve the behavior of a trading\nstrategy, even turning a random, losing strategy into a profitable one! \nAnother less complicated method to use for a bullish trending mar-\nket condition is placing a stop below the lowest low from the most re-\ncent 10-day period. Another method is a trailing stop method using the\nlowest low from the last conditional change. I define the last condi-\ntional change as a higher closing high.

Buyers who stepped in on the open have a\nstrong conviction that price should expand to new higher territory\nonce the market established a new high ground. Therefore, if the lows\nare violated, then the market is demonstrating weakness. In Figure 9.3,\nwe are looking at the daily chart on gold. Starting from the low on No-\nvember 4 near 465, the market does not make a lower closing low. On\nDecember 1, we see a close at a doji low but not below the low of the\ndoji. The trend then continues higher with a sequence of higher highs,\nhigher lows, and higher closing highs. \nIt is not until the shooting star develops that the intermediate top\nis made. A stop placed beneath the low of the candle prior to the star\nwould be the last conditional change or the last higher closing high\nthat occurred. That would be where you would want to place a sell\nstop. Using the two-period lowest-low method, you would have been\nstopped out at 528.

They have:\n• A system or a method that provides an accurate daily market forecast,\nhelping them define where the market might go each day.\n• A set of rules for when to get in and out of the market and a bit of dis-\ncipline to follow these rules.\n• A set of timing indicators to help them pull the trigger at the key areas.\nThe legendary basketball coach Bob Knight often says, “Most people\nhave the will to win; few people have the will to prepare to win.” This is true\nin many aspects of a person’s life, be it in athletics, academics, business, a\nprofession, or trading.\nTrading is about making money, not about being correct in market\nanalysis or being a great prognosticator. Traders must be consistent in their\napproach and strive to completely remove emotion from trading decisions.\nThis is often best achieved by having and sticking to a plan for every trade.\nWe trade in the future markets, not in the past markets. Hindsight is always\n20/20. Keep in mind that you will never trade as well in real time with real\nmoney as you will by looking at or trading in the past. Trading in the past is\nan exercise in futility that will only harm your psyche going forward. You\nshould view every trade you make as the best trade you could make at the\ntime with the information available. That is why I like to scale out of my po-\nsitions as a short-term trader at market points that signal when a trend has\n",

I do not\nknow if a market will develop into a consolidation phase or if it is simply\npausing before continuing the trend or getting ready to reverse the trend en-\ntirely. Therefore, it is crucial to take money off the table when given the op-\nportunity, while letting a trade mature and potentially develop into a larger\nprofit. There is only one way I know to manage such a feat, and that is by\nscaling out of partial positions. The question some traders ask is, “What is\nthe formula or percentage that I use to take positions off?” I normally use\nthe 50 percent rule, but at times the one-third rule works as well. In order\nto define what the percentage figure is, I need to judge what condition the\nmarket is in. I do that by using the diagnosis described in this book. In the\ntrade process, there are three critical stages: \n1. Gathering information on which to make decisions. \n2. Using that information to help formulate a trading idea.\n3. Planning the actions to be taken. \nThe gathering of information involves collecting past data and then ap-\nplying it to a specific means of market analysis, such as what I have covered\nin this book using pivot point analysis. In formulating ideas, you may look\nat the pivot point moving averages to help determine a market’s ability to\nmake a certain price range. This step helps you to predict where the market\nmight head and then gives you information so that you can decide where it\nshould be going. Planning action involves thinking creatively about alter-\nnative courses of action, evaluating their feasibility, and making decisions\non implementation of the plans. This step involves helping you decide if you\nshould be in multiple contracts or if you should scale back on your normal\nposition size. If the risk is not worth the reward, then trade with fewer po-\nsitions. In other words, scale back your normal position size.\nSTEPS TO SUCCESS\nThe steps outlined here are a review of the overall purpose of the trading\nmethods discussed in this book. Pivot point analysis helps give me a “heads\nup” on the potential range of a session. The moving average of the pivot\npoint helps give me a truer reflection of the market’s value, and that helps\nme define the market’s condition and possibly the correct direction. Can-\ndlestick charts help illustrate and define the trigger, which enables me to\ncarry out a systematic process of arriving at optimum plans and strategies\nfor my trades. With that, I am now aware of the full range of issues to be\n270\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

By ex-\namining a set of relevant questions, such as how low the market can go,\nwhat the next support target is, how high the market can go, and what the\nnext resistance level is, I can formulate a trading plan with a clear, concise\nstrategic idea. Exiting the positions and taking money off the table should\nbe the easy part. However, as it turns out, that is the hardest part for most\ntraders.\nLet’s take a trade example as shown in Figure 10.1. The hammer forms;\nI buy on the close, as the market closed above the moving averages; and I\nhave immediate results. I entered at 10765; and the bullish momentum car-\nried the market higher, as indicated by higher highs, higher lows, and higher\nclosing highs. The market has lost the bullish momentum, as I see a lower-\nclose-than-open pattern develop on two time periods followed by a doji.\nThat is the definition of price action demonstrating a loss in bullish mo-\nmentum. Therefore, that dictates for me to liquidate half of my position,\nwhich is at 10780. Hardly a profit to speak of, considering the mini-Dow is\n$5 per point, which is only a $75 profit.

In this example, I would suggest either moving stops up to my\nbreak-even point or, as just discussed, placing the stop on a close below\nthe low of the most recent conditional change candle (a higher closing\nhigh), which occurs at the 6:15 time period. At this point, I do not know if\nthe market will move higher or lower, but I definitely have a loss of mo-\nmentum. In this situation, prices established a pause, or consolidation; and\nthen the market did break out and continued the uptrend. With scaling out\nof half of the position, I have a profit and am continuously participating in\na tremendous trending condition, as the market ends up more than 10870.\nThat equates to more than a 110-point gain, or $550 per contract, on the bal-\nance of positions. As a day trader, did I do wrong in liquidating half of my\nposition? Not if you follow rules. In this situation, I did not have a classic\nsell signal, just an indication of a loss in momentum. Therefore, it was a\nprudent measure to get paid on partial positions and let the balance ride.\nSo in this example, there was a reason or a call to action, but not a signal\nfor a reversal of the long.\n272\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\nFIGURE 10.2\nUsed with permission of esignal.com.\n",

Covering half of your positions\nwhen markets signal a loss in momentum is carrying through what you are\nable to do. You made money and stayed with the trade.\nIn Figure 10.2, we have a low close doji trigger, a classic crossover of\nthe moving averages, and prices closing below both moving averages. A\ntrigger to sell short was generated at 10523. We see a beautiful event un-\nfold—immediate results with lower highs, lower lows, and lower closing\nlows—until the 11:50 time period; and the market moves sideways in a con-\nsolidation pattern. It does take on the form of a bearish descending triangle;\nhowever, we do not know what the outcome will be. As the market is at\n10490,. we are staring at a 30-point mini-Dow move, which translates into a\n$150 profit per contract. At this time, it is prudent to cover half of the posi-\ntion and put the stop in at breakeven. The market in fact happens to move\nin the direction of the original trend as the bearish triangle indicated. By fol-\nlowing the market flow, we finally see a specific reason to cover the bal-\nance of the position with the high close doji signal at 10483. Here we have\na 40-point gain on the second half of the trade for a $200 gain. We have, in\nessence, captured the majority of the trend and kept disciplined in our trad-\ning approach while scaling out of half of the position.\nDO SOMETHING GREAT\nI am sure you have read or heard this expression sometime in your life: “I’d\nrather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing\nand succeed.” By scaling out, you have a profit in your trading account\nwhile letting the trade mature. You have accomplished a great thing, a true\nsense of following a business plan—and you made money.\nScaling out of positions is the most apropriate method when the mar-\nket gives you a clue that the trend momentum is slowing. It allows you to\ncapture a profit while participating in a potential market move. As a day\ntrader, you are not so much concerned with long-term macroeconomic sit-\nuations as you are with riding a momentum wave. Granted, it helps to have\na good understanding of fundamental conditions; but for the most part, you\nare looking to ride a move and profit from it. That is your job. In short-term\ntrading, conditions change; and you need to capture opportunities as they\nbecome present stocks. Foreign exchange (forex) and futures markets are\nideal for momentum trades. Traders need assistance with capturing the\nprofits while letting the balance of the position ride or, better stated, with\nan execution plan. The foreign currency markets also tend to trend well\nover the course of 7 to 10 days, allowing swing traders opportunities to cap-\nture larger price swings over a given period of time.

This is a perfect opportunity to scale out of half of your po-\nsitions. Remember that in Chapter 2 we went over the fact that once a mar-\nket goes into trend mode, it will then go into a consolidation phase. We do\nnot know if the trend will continue or reverse; so at this point, it makes\nsense to trail a stop on the balance of positions.\nI use the point just above the last conditional change, which is the can-\ndle that made the last lower closing low.

We would lower our stops\non the balance to 1262.25 to lock in profits on the balance of positions.\nUsing the pivot point target levels will help you identify when and where to\nscale out of positions.\nBUY SUPPORT, SELL RESISTANCE\nThroughout this book, I have made many references to why I look for buy\nsignals at the predetermined pivot point support levels and take sell signals\nat predetermined resistance levels. This also falls along the lines of not\nknowing the outcome of the trading signal and market trend conditions,\nwhich can and do change. As a day trader looking to capture a portion of a\nday’s potential trading range, you have to use a plan. Scaling out of posi-\ntions is such a plan of action. Take a look at Figure 10.5. We have a spot\nforex euro currency versus the U.S. dollar. Notice that the market breaks\nbelow the targeted pivot point support several times; however, prices do\nnot seem to decline very far or carry any momentum. In fact, a low close\ndoji pattern develops, which means, if you follow my rules, you do not take\nsell signals at support. This helps filter out the false trading signals. Once\nwe have a high close doji trigger to go long at 119.83, we now can place our\nstop and follow the developments as the trade matures. We see higher\nhighs, higher lows, and higher closing highs. The market closes closer to\nthe highs of each successive candle, and the closes of each candle are\nabove the opens. These are all very bullish signs, and the market blasts be-\nyond the first resistance (R-1) point. So far, we do not have a reason to liq-\nuidate the position or scale out of the trade. Then as the market trades at\nthe R-2 level, we see a doji form; and that will be the clue to scale out of\nhalf of the position near 120.20.

With that said, once you have a trading idea about the way a market\nmoves, through your own observation, you can apply it to computer code\nand have a computer generate an alert to inform you when a signal is gen-\nerated.\nThrough the proficiency of computers, we can take historical data and\nback-test the results to see how reliable and accurate the theories are.

Therefore, it is\nimportant to back-test a methodology for various time periods and in vari-\nous noncorrelated markets to see if the principles are sound and stand the\ntest of time.

Another way of stating this is:\n• For a positive assigned candle:\nClose (C) is greater than open (O) ( C > O)\n• For a negative assigned candle:\nClose is less than open (C < O)\n• For a doji candle, with a neutral (=) assigned value:\nClose is equal to open (C = O)\n• You can program your own system to generate an exit strategy based\non an average holding period of, say, seven or eight periods or until the\nmarket forms a lower close than open (C < O) or a negative assigned\nvalue and if that time period closes below the prior time period’s low.\nAnother methodology or system that is a simpler program would be to\ncombine a three-period pivot point moving average with a five-period pivot\npoint moving average.

This may give a trader an edge by\nadding another dimensional element that combines the seasonal factor for\ntiming with targeting a price level from pivot points. Using this approach\ncan help light the path to a trading system that a trader can back-test on his\nor her own through software such as Genesis.\nHISTORY LESSONS\nI want to combine the lessons on how to choose the right pivot point sup-\nport and resistance numbers with how those values relate to the market di-\nrection number. This can help you determine if the market has departed\ntoo far from the mean or too far from what I call the “fair value” of the mar-\nket. Start by examining the past price history. Once you see where the mar-\nket was and how far the market has moved in a given length of time (pace\nof price change), you can possibly determine the realm of reality of where\na target level of support may be located. You can use this information to de-\ntermine if a market is significantly overbought or, as we will show in this\nexample, oversold and ripe for a buying opportunity. When a market is sig-\nnificantly oversold, the conditions exist for a consolidation phase and a re-\nversal of trend, especially when we have a seasonal condition. This\nconcept applies in commodities, stocks, and foreign exchange (forex) mar-\nkets as well.\nLet’s take a look at how the bottom formed in the stock market in Oc-\ntober 2005 as we review and expand on the Stock Trader’s Almanac MACD\nsignal. Figure 11.1 is my sheet from the week ending October 14. We use\nthis sheet as a quick reference so I can see what the past week’s high, low,\nand close were. The pivot point is displayed in the far right column. We see\nthat in the prior week, the high in Standard & Poor’s (S&P) was 1239. The\npivot point is 1208, and the pivot point moving average is 1220.58 (round\ndown to 1220.50). The indication is that the market is bearish, so we would\nlook at the Bearish Target column and see 1155. Here is where back-testing\nsoftware may help you determine what the largest price range is in a given\nThe Sample Analysis\n283\n",

Because I want\nto know if 1155 is an unrealstic number to hit if the market was at 1239 and\nthe standard range was 40 points. From the prior week’s high to the pro-\njected bearish S-2 target low, that would be an 84.00-point price decline.\nNot unheard of but not realistic, at least not in one week’s trading period.\nAt the very least, we need to see how the market reacts at the S-1 target sup-\nport number, 1177.50, labeled as the Target Key Number, which is the S-1\npivot number.\nOn further examination, we see the market closed the week ending\n10/07/2005 at 1200. So sometime in the following week, I want to heighten\nmy awareness or program a system to alert me to when or if the market\nreaches that level and if a buy signal exists at or near 1177.50, such as if a\nhammer or doji is present within five points above or below that level. After\nall, we have a decent sample of statistics that reveal that these two candle\npatterns form at or near the lows in e-mini–S&Ps a high percentage of the\ntime on an intraday 15-minute period.\nThe low was made on 10/13/2005 at 1172; it closed that day back above\nthe pivot support at 1178.25. The next session formed a high close doji\n(HCD). Using the HCD pattern and trading by the rules, you would have\nbought at 1189.75; and your risk was a stop on a close below the doji low,\nwhich was at 1172. The most pressure you took on a futures position trade\nwas from your entry price to the lowest low on a pull-back was when it\nretested the low at 1174, which is 16 points. The stop-close-only order was\nthe correct risk mechanism for this position trade. Using a seasonal factor\ncombined with pivot point analysis helped traders pinpoint both the time\nand the price of a particular market; and in using historical seasonal infor-\nmation, traders would possibly want to employ a longer-term risk-and-\nreward strategy. Even if you are a one-day or swing trader, seasonal factors\ncan help identify the side of the market to be on, like in a bullish environ-\nment to look to buy breaks. My point is that if you are a position trader,\nyour risks and reward objectives should be greater than those of a day\ntrader. Here we have a trading opportunity based on several factors. All we\nneed to do now is select a strategy.\nWHICH STRATEGY TO SELECT?\nIf buying the futures markets seemed too risky, you at least have a situation\nwhere you can explore longer-term low-risk/high-reward options strate-\ngies such as S&P call options. That was my recommendation in my weekly\nnewsletter. You could apply this analysis to buy Standard & Poor’s De-\npositary Receipts (SPDRs), Diamonds, Nasdaq QQQs, or options on those\nThe Sample Analysis\n285\n",

This is why all traders can use pivot\npoint support and resistance analysis to help time trades better with both\nelements, time and price.\nI went over how to use the pivot point as a moving average in Chapter\n6. In Figure 11.3, I took the liberty of highlighting the pivot point to illustrate\nthe slope (or direction) of the moving average. Once the market hits the\npivot support, the market moves in a consolidation phase; but the pivot\npoint average is sloping higher, indicating a bullish bias. Granted, you al-\nways want to see immediate results as a trader; but using the seasonal fac-\ntors identified by Stock Trader’s Almanac combined with pivot point\nsupport targets and a pivot point moving average component gives you a\nmuch better timed entry and method to identify a trend reversal.\nOne more advantage of incorporating the pivot point average is that as\nthe market finally blasts off, the moving average component generates a\nsell signal and the histogram makes a negative zero-line cross.

As this illustrates, \nfor my day trading program, I use both the 5-minute and the 15-minute \nperiods with the e-mini–S&P, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) \nmini-Dow, 30-year Treasury bonds, euro currency, and the spot forex\nBritish pound. Except for in this figure, the one chart that is second from\nthe right is a 5-minute chart on bonds; and under it is a 15-minute chart on\nthe euro currency.\nI use this system to help confirm buy and sell signals, as indicated with\nthe arrows. When we are at the projected support targets, which the soft-\nware indicates by green support lines, arrows appear, indicating to go long.\nThe chart on the left is the e-mini–S&P; the 5-minute is on top and the 15-\nminute is beneath it. See how arrows point up simultaneously, which indi-\ncates a buy signal, especially as the market is near support. The chart\nsecond from the left is the mini-Dow with the 5-minute on top and the 15-\nminute beneath it. The 5-minute time period generates a buy signal against\nthe pivot point support targets simultaneously with the e-mini–S&P. This\ncorroborates the buy signal, as it has developed in both markets. It is also\nconfirmed in the 15-minute chart beneath it.\nWHAT IS THE BEST DAY TRADING CONFIRMATION\nTRIGGER TO PROGRAM?\nThe most reliable trading signal is when the 5-minute time period triggers\na buy when the 15-minute time period is also in a buy mode; in other words,\nthe best signals are when the 5-minute period is in sync with the 15-minute\ntime period in a pivot point moving average crossover system.

I want to show you that any\nsystem worth following needs to show sizable profits with reasonable risks.\nNo system is 100 percent accurate, at least none that I know of in reality. If\none existed, I would believe through the laws of probabilities that it was\ndue for a breakdown. There are several categories on which you want to\nfocus that will enlighten you as to the true validity of the methods. In\nessence, back-testing allows you to closely examine your system’s ineffi-\nciencies so you can correct the flaws. Looking at the back-test results will\nalso help you understand when to increase position sizes, when to avoid\ntrading, and how to facilitate improvements.\nYou want to see if the reasons you make decisions to execute a trade\nconsistently generate more profits when you are right than losses when the\nsystem or trade fails. If less than 70 percent of trades result in winning\ntrades, you want the winners to outgain the losses. It makes no sense to\nhave a 70 percent winning system that generates more losses than winners\nand longer holding periods. Imagine what that will do to your psyche, not to\nmention your trading account.\nIt is important that you understand what elements trigger a trade when\nthe transaction is entered or exited. This helps in determining another way\nto account for slippage. For example, if the system generates buy and sell\nsignals on the close or on the next open, if this is a day trading program,\nthen there may be less chance for price gaps. However, if the system exe-\ncutes based on the closing price or on the next open, such as what we have\ndisclosed in the high close doji pattern or the low close doji pattern, then on\novernight positions you may experience poor entry or exits. With that\nknowledge, you can change your program to include the next available\nopen, which would include night sessions. \nLet me clarify what the night session is for various trading vehicles. As\nwe know, there is no official close in spot foreign currencies. Therefore,\nyou need to assign a daily close and then an open. In Chapter 1, I revealed\nthat I use the New York Bank settlement of 5 P.M. (ET) and use the open as\nthe next five-minute interval.

This information should help you stay\nemotionally grounded by achieving two things: (1) not getting too upset\nwhen losses occur; (2) not overpositioning yourself in trades if and when\nyou have a win streak with more than eight or nine consecutive trades. \nMost people lose big as they see their systems or methods generate huge\nprofits many times in a row. They get this feeling that their trading is invin-\ncible or impervious to losers. And then, wham, that’s when a drawdown pe-\nriod occurs! Generally, it is at this point that a trader goes from trading 10\ncontracts to 50 contracts. All it takes is one bad trade, and you have wiped\naway your trading profits or, worse, your entire trading account.\nMONEY MANAGEMENT IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS\nUsing the Defcon trading system, we started with a trading account balance\nof $10,000. The overnight initial speculative margin for the CME’s e-\nmini–S&P, as of 2/15/2006 was $3,938 per contract. Therefore, with trading\njust one contract, we had committed 39 percent of our trading capital at any\none time.

This is a novel idea and is what truly helps\ntraders get wealthy—knowing when to fold, hold, or add on.\nIf you look at Figure 11.5, you see a chart with an equity curve showing\nsome pretty good gains with an occasional bump in the road. Recoverable\nas it is, a drawdown in profits occurs. Using system analysis can help you\ndetermine most consecutive wins and losses and what the largest loss is.\nArmed with that information, you can now go on to trading like a true\nmegastar professional fund manager—or simply a downright happy\ncamper. Why? Because that information will help you determine the next\nlevel of profits you have to build in order to increase your lot size. If you do\nnot manage your money properly and double or quadruple your position\nsize before doubling your account size, you could be in for a rude awaken-\ning. As you can see, the maximum drawdown experienced is –4,062.50 on\n11/10/2004. If that was the day you decided to mistakenly increase your lot\nsize, it may have potentially wiped your account out.\nIn Table 11.2, observe that the largest loss is $1,825. By increasing your\nlot size prematurely or or by having an imbalance to largest loss in rela-\ntionship to account balance, such as having four or more contracts on at\nany one time, you could wipe out not only your gains but also the majority\nof your account.

As a systems\ntrader, asking how a system performs during different times of the year is\na novel idea, especially as seasonal forces can impact a market. Ask ques-\ntions such as, “When is the best or the worst time to trade?” From a simple\nyet elegant standpoint, the answer for day traders in equities is lunchtime.\nThis is substantiated by volume levels generally declining during that time\nframe. Forex traders note that trading activity is light from 10 P.M. (ET)\nuntil 1:30 A.M. (ET), as we discussed in Chapter 1. What about on a weekly\nor monthly basis? When does our system perform best?\nBy tracking trading performance, as shown in Table 11.3, from a his-\ntorical perspective, we can form an opinion of when the system is at peak\nperformance or when the market we are trading is in sync with seasonal\nfactors. There is never a guarantee that past performance is indicative of fu-\nture results, but we can and do benefit from studying history. Without a\ndoubt, I do not want to go on a major tangent here; but we are trading in a\nnew frontier environment. The new age of technology has more people\ntrading online, and more people are more computer savvy. We have an in-\ntricate globalization of our economy. Trading partners with China and even\nIndia is not like what we had just five years ago. So with that perspective,\nmy opinion is that looking at seasonal tendencies of a market starting from\n2000 up through 2005 would not be a huge statistical event, but it would be\nmore relevant than a testing period in 1990 through 1995. With that in mind,\nwe ran a test, as the results show in Figure 11.6, to see which months per-\nform best with the “Defcon III model.”\nUsing the Genesis Software product and asking the right questions\n(e.g., When is the best time to trade?), I can get a reasonable answer. In fact,\nI wanted to know which months are the best and which months are the\nworst in which to trade. Using the Genesis Software, I can run back tests to\nsee what the performance from a seasonal perspective with the Defcon\nsystem looks like on a monthly performance basis. Using a test period over\nthe past three years, I am able to conclude that April is a month to avoid\ntrading! Based on a three-year average, this is the month that consistently\ndelivers drawdowns. With that statistical information, I have a slight edge\nin the market, as it relates with my system. I can make a decision either to\nlower my contract sizes or to avoid trading entirely. Figure 11.7 shows the\nyearly breakdown of the compiled results.\nThe more statistics I have, the better prepared I am; and with that\nknowledge, I have stacked the odds in my favor. This is the ultimate in trad-\ning tools and system designs: being able to identify opportunity and dis-\ncover the weakest link in my chain of trading system.

That computes to a daily trading range of $1,075\nper day. In using strict money management guidelines, we are using only 28\npercent of our investment capital. So in the spirit of being a great trader, I\nwant to ask why I would trade only one contract with a starting account of\n$10,000. The answer is clear, and another great example of why it is impor-\ntant to know what you are doing before you do it. By back-testing a system,\nI can determine what the worst to expect is. Granted, we did not implement\nany means for risk management. The Defcon system solely generates a\ntrade triggered by the pivot point moving average approach. You will see\nthat by going back and validating the methodology, we had a single loss in\nthe amount of $4,313. That is the bad news; and more than likely, as with\nany severe and sudden market loss, it was generated by a shocking news\nevent. The monthly unemployment report on August 6, 2004, was one such\nevent where the euro currency moved almost 260 points in a single day.\nThis was a good definition of a news-driven price shock. As the data in\nTable 11.3 shows, the profits were bigger in the euro than they were in the\ne-mini–S&P; but so were the risks. So we have a bigger profit; but along\nwith that greater profit came greater risks. How many times have you heard\nthat before? The bigger the risk, the bigger the rewards. I have heard that a\nbunch of times, but it is great to see it put in front of me based on a defined\nset of rules. So if I get the feeling one day to go “all in” like a poker player\nand use 100 percent of my margin, in the euro currency I could easily do\nthree contracts. In one bad day, not only would I wipe my account, but I\ncould be deficit, meaning I could actually lose every penny in my account\nand owe money.\nUsing the back-tested results of a system allows me to see my pro-\ngram’s strengths and weaknesses. That is the edge I have against the mar-\nket—knowing when to raise my positions and when not to. Besides\nlearning that my system can make money, I also found out that I need to\ndouble my account if I want to double my positions. Using a computer\nproduct like Genesis allows me to identify and validate the methods em-\nployed. As we look at the equity curve in Figure 11.9, we can see a solid per-\nformance; and that should help maintain your confidence to stick with\ntrades generated by the signals. Figure 11.9 also highlights a negative\n$13,162.50 maximum drawdown from peak profits. Imagine increasting\nyour lot or contract size prematurely during that negative phase. It would\ncertainly ruin your trading day, year, or even career!\nIn the stacked bar graph in Figure 11.10, we see the results of peak per-\nformance; and more important, we see the kink in our armor, the weakest\npoint in our system from a seasonal perspective. By back-testing the sys-\ntem, our diagnosis shows a seasonal weakness in the markets that occurs\nin January and February and continues into March. We know from the table\n",

Great traders take the trades that were developed\nwith thought and with keen observations that were based on prede-\nfined trading signals. This mentality will help you develop the confidence to\nexecute when a trading opportunity presents itself. Lack of confidence and\nfear are your enemies. Trading on a rule-based system will help you over-\ncome most emotional issues as long as you are trading based on a signal or\ntrigger. Never take action on anticipating the signal. If the rule states to\nbuy when X crosses over Y, you have to wait for the cross rather than an-\nticipating that the cross is about to occur. That is what trigger means: It is\na call to action based on a conditional change. \nMany experienced losing traders who have come to me for help have a\ncommon problem—they try to jump the gun and try to outguess the market.\nThey have this feeling that they will miss the opportunity if they don’t act.\nBy now, you know what a candle chart is; and you have read many times\nthat it is imperative that you wait for the close of the time period for which\nyou are trading to close before acting on a buy or a sell signal. Look at Fig-\nure 12.1—the candle on the left may have given an impression that a bull-\nish breakout would materialize. However, keep in mind that unless you\nwaited for the close, it really formed a doji. Imagine getting all wrapped up\nemotionally, thinking you were missing a great buying opportunity only to\nexperience buying the high of the time period because you failed to be pa-\ntient and disciplined in waiting for the time period to conclude, assuring\nyou of the buy signal, or of the higher close.\n",

      "text": "If you anticipate a signal, you might be right; and there are times when\nyou can anticipate taking a trade based on a formulated, educated guess.\nOne such scenario would be to make a buying decision based on what I call\na “gap band” play. That is when the market departs too far from the pivot\npoint moving average, which for a buying opportunity would be defined as\na potentially overstretched price extreme or oversold market condition.\nArmed with the longer-term numbers, such as a monthly second support (S-\n2) target, I would look to go long but with partial positions; or I would sim-\nply scale into a position with from one-quarter up to one-third of my normal\nlot size or positions.\nHere is where it might seem like I would be playing the “catch the\nfalling knife” game, which I am. But when the market has the capacity to\nmake a major price reversal, especially when several indicators line up,\nsuch as stochastics warning of bullish convergence, the Commodity Fu-\ntures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commitment of Traders (COT) report\nshows a major imbalance, as discussed. Then if the market has been in a\nlong-term downtrend and shows that prices have departed too far from the\nmean, that is what spotting a buying opportunity is about. That is also\nwhen, under these certain conditions, it is apropriate to anticipate a trade.\nYou should cut back on your initial position size and set a risk factor such\nas a conditional setup if the market, for instance, makes a lower closing\nlow. You can also add a time element, such as “If the market does not re-\nverse in X amount of periods, then get out.” In a situation like this, you\ncould implement a longer-term option strategy, such as buying call options.\n(I did not go into options in this book because that subject matter was cov-\nered in my first book on page 217.) Options are a great investment vehicle\nthat offers traders peace of mind and confidence to pull the trigger in highly\nvolatile and precarious situations, such as picking longer-term tops and\nbottoms, especially in the bullish scenario just described. Remember, I\nhave stated many times that as traders, we “look for opportunity and then\napply a strategy.” That is how we capture potential profits on big reversals.\n308\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\nFIGURE 12.1\n",

One such question is, “Is the risk worth the reward?” If it\nis, take the opportunity.\nWAIT FOR THE TRADE SIGNALS\nFor day, short-term, or swing trading, you need to wait for signals and trade\nby those signals. That seems easier said than done. But it is a common mis-\ntake that I have helped traders with, especially when they have jumped the\ngun, anticipating a buy signal from an indicator such as stochastics. We\nwent over the stochastics %K and %D 20-level line-cross signal.

      "text": "tently apply this method. Ultimately, your performance and trading results\nwill improve.\nWe discussed in Chapter 3 how to use the stochastics oscillator prop-\nerly. It is so important. Let’s review: If you anticipated a buy signal based on\nthe stochastics %K and %D hook crossover the first time, you should notice\nhow either of the two closed above the 20 percent line in Figure 12.2. In ad-\ndition, you did not see a higher closing high collaborate a buy signal. An-\nticipating without confirming factors or misreading a signal can and usually\ndoes result in losses. Notice that the second signal where both %K and %D\ncross and close above the 20 percent level is confirmed with a higher clos-\ning high. This is a confirming signal and will put you in a better mindset and\nmore often than not on the profitable side of the ledger. Remember, your\nmind can and does play tricks on you when you are trading. That little sub-\nconscious voice will tell you to just hang in there, to just keep holding on to\nthe loser, because the market will bounce back. Odds are that fear takes\nover and you sell out of a long, right on the low of the move. You cannot act\non emotional impulse. If you act on impulse and you are wrong, you need\nto get out immediately once and if the market breaks further against you,\nbecause the emotional state of greed got you into the trade and the emo-\ntional state of fear will get you out. Usually it is on the low. If you wait for\na true buy signal based on the closing price action, you are trading with the\ncurrent flow of the market. This method of trading, once you see consistent\nresults, will increase your confidence; and that will give you what it takes\nto become a successful trader consistently over time.\nTHE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND\nMany times traders subconsciously sabotage themselves inadvertently.\nAvoid putting yourself in a situation that will cause you to be skeptical or\nafraid before you trade. A better way to state it is, do not trade while un-\ndergoing a major personal setback. This would include stressful events like\nbuying or selling a house, moving, sickness, a change in careers or a loss of\na job, a death in the family, or loss of a friend. A breakup in a relationship\nor a divorce can also cause undue stress. Try to make educated decisions,\nand make sure you have the time to invest in your work before putting on\nany trades. Remember that it is alright to be wrong; just don’t be wrong all\nthe time, making the same mistakes over and over again. If you follow a\nproven strategy, you are already aware that there will be losses. We dis-\ncussed this in Chapter 11. If you are trading on the edge, not in the right\nframe of mind, angry, or upset, then you have lost the emotional edge that\nis needed to stay focused and disciplined.\n310\nCANDLESTICK AND PIVOT POINT TRADING TRIGGERS\n",

This is one method\nthat can help keep you on track when you start trading out of impulse or\nfrom an emotional state of mind.\nTRACK AND CHART YOUR TRADES\nA trading diary is a great way to check and confirm your trading execution\nentries and exits. In fact, most charting software has the capability to go\nback to see when you executed a trade. Think what this can do for a trader.\nIf it is followed properly, it can and most likely will help you to improve \nto a new level of self-discipline and ultimately lead to increasing your self-\nconfidence. How? If you execute when the signals call for action, you can\nvalidate whether you responded when called to do so. You can check your\nwork. You will find out if you hesitated when your methods called for you\nto exit and if you timed it per the system or not. One lesson we teach our\nstudents at Trading Triggers University is to save a chart and print it out\nwith the entry scale-out and exit. Printing the chart out helps you to see\nclearly how you respond or react to the trade signals. It will reinforce the\nvalidity of your system or any system, including my Defcon program with\nGenesis Software. By printing out and cataloging your trades by a chart,\nyou will gain more experience in identifying the patterns that drive your\ntrading signals. It also keeps track of or “inventories” what went right or\nwhat went wrong with a trading plan. It will allow you to study and exam-\nine the results in black and white. On successful trading days, it will be\ngood to capitalize on your successes so that they can be repeated. Of\ncourse, on bad days, it can allow you to focus on what went wrong so that\nyou can understand and improve on it so that you stop repeating the same\nmistakes over and over again.\nTWO CASES IN POINT\nIf you map out a game plan, trade off the “numbers,” or have a trading sys-\ntem, when you print out your chart and examine your trades, you are grad-\ning your own homework. I have posted on my web site a daily Dow Report\nto which the Chicago Board of Trade links. Every day after the market\ncloses, I post two numbers based on my teachings and on what we went\nover in this book. Those numbers are what I believe the high and/or low of\nthe session will be; and then, based on the market direction number, I will\npost a trade recommendation.

That makes all the\nsense in the world.\nA trader needs to take action when a trigger is generated, rather than\ntaking a wait-and-see attitude and then reacting to the market long after the\nmarket has moved.

If you cut out of a winning\ntrade too early and do so randomly because you need to make a profit, then\nyou are possibly setting yourself up for a financial meltdown because you\nare not letting your winners ride.\nOne question that new investors ask me is why they did better at paper\ntrading than they did when they traded with real money. The answer is\neasy. They let their emotions such as fear, doubt, complacency, greed, anx-\niety, excitement, and false pride interfere with their rational and intellectual\nthoughts. When dealing with real money, you are faced with the realization\nthat you and your money can part.\nSimulated trading is good to understand the mechanics of a trading ex-\necution platform. However, putting real money on the line is what will test\nyour trading skills. Here is a suggestion: If you want to really see if you have\nwhat it takes to be a professional trader who can execute a testable trading\nsystem, then trade with the smallest lot or position size for a period of six\nweeks or two months. You may not make lots of money if you are consis-\ntently right, but you will develop the confidence to act on your signals when\nyour self-imposed training session is completed. If you trade stocks, in-\nstead of trading 200 shares of an $80 or $100 stock, trade 50 shares. This\nwill help you feel more at ease, and it will also put your emotions to the test\nas you are trading with real money.\nHere is another suggestion: Open an ultra-mini-sized foreign exchange\n(forex) account and apply the trading signal to that market. This is a nifty\nidea for those who are beginners and still have day jobs. The markets trade\n24 hours a day, you can afford to hold positions overnight, and you have\nmoney on the line so that you will be more realistic in execution of your\ntrading plan. You can trade at night and execute trading signals in an ex-\ntremely liquid market. If you have a system that works reasonably well\nbased on statistical back-testing studies, the only confidence that should be\nin question is your ability to execute the signals. That is what trading a\nmini-forex account can do for you. It will exercise your emotional intellect.\nYou will learn that when you place a trade, it is an educated decision, not\nmerely a guess. One web site to visit is www.fxtriggers.com to help select\na forex account and to open a simulated trading account and develop the\nknowledge that will give you the confidence to execute and act on the trad-\ning signals. Building confidence in yourself and in your trading skills is ex-\ntremely important in stimulating an optimistic winning attitude. Opening a\nmini-forex account just may help a newcomer using a technical-based sys-\ntem. Over a period of time, as your trading skills improve, so will your atti-\ntude.
