      "text": "Preface \nIn these modern times of high-tech trading devices, with all the latest \ngadgets at the push of a button, price action traders may come off as \nsomewhat old-school. With nothing in front of them but the bars in the \nchart, there is little in their workspace that bears witness of the digital \nwave. Are they mere relics from a fading past, soon to be extinct, or \ncould it be that there is merit in this seemingly stubborn defiance of \ntrading evolution? \nOne way to answer this is to point out the actual benefits of every \nindicator craze that has swept across the trading landscape for the \npast so many years. Not an easy chore by any means. A simpler solu­\ntion, perhaps, is to focus attention on the price action trader instead \nand see if we can come to appreciate his one and only tool, the naked \nchart. \nWith the latter idea in mind, Understanding Price Action is written \nnot just to establish the virtues of the price action method, but to serve \nas a practical guide on the matter. The core premise within is that any \ndedicated student, before long, should be able to trade confidently \nand profitably from a clean chart without ever feeling lost or otherwise \ndeprived. \nFor the purpose of illustration, any price chart could basically do, \nbut few are better suited for the job than the 5-minute chart of the eur / \nusd currency pair. A true creature of habit, this market has long since \nbeen the favorite of countless traders around the globe and it's hard to \nv \n",

      "text": "Understanding Price Action \nthink of a more accessible platform for the technical discussions in the \nchapters ahead. \nWhen taking up the task of writing this guide, the objective was not \njust to show a pallet of trading concepts on a number of cherry-picked \ncharts, but to give a fair impression also of their practical implementa­\ntion on a day-to-day basis. For this purpose, the book has been split \ninto two parts. \nPart I lays out the principles of price action and discusses entry and \nexit techniques on a broad range of educational charts. In Part 2 we will \nexamine how these findings hold up on a more continuous basis. In­\ncluded within is a series of six months of consecutive 5-minute sessions \nof the eur / usd. Besides providing a massive amount of study material, \nthis series should leave little doubt behind as to the amazing continuity \nand exploitability of price action themes from one session to the next. \nOne of the most common questions I rec.eived in response to my \nfirst book, Forex Price Action Scalping, was if the principles and setups \npointed out on a fast scalping chart (70-tick) could also be applied to the \nhigher intraday frames, like the 2 or 5-minute, or even the hourly for \nthat matter. There can only be one answer to this question: price action \nprinciples are transposable to any time frame of choice because they \nbear within them the universal laws of supply and demand. This is not \nbounded by the time in which it takes place, nor is it a prerogative of \nany one market. From one instrument or time frame to another, subtle \nadaptations may be called for, if only to accommodate for the differ­\nences in average range or motion; but the trading concepts of the price \naction method are just as applicable to futures, indices, stocks, com­\nmodities, bonds, or what have you, as they are to the Forex markets. \nAs will be demonstrated also, price action principles are not only \nfree from the boundaries of market and frame, they stand above the \nnature of the trading environment as well. To illustrate this point, a \nspecial section is included on how to tackle a very persistent climate of \nlow volatility by slightly tweaking standard procedure to better suit the \nconditions at hand. We will examine this adaptation process from the \nviewpoint of a faster intraday frame on several currency pairs and some \npopular non-Forex markets. \nVI \n",

      "text": "Chapter 1 \nA Time to Trade and a Time to Study \nWhile the indicator hype has far from run its course, more and more \ntraders are coming to see the virtues of the \"less is more\" philosophy. \nAnd with reason. There is something strikingly serene about a chart \nstripped down to the bare essentials. There are no riddles to decipher, \nno conflicting signals to evade, there is nothing cluttering up the screen. \nIt's all about facts-and they are out in the open. The bars in the chart \nhold nothing back, nor will their message ever lag behind. With these \nbenefits in mind, the price action trader adheres to a very simple prem­\nise: if a high-odds trade cannot be spotted straight off the chart, it is \njust no! there. \nStill and all, without a proper understanding of market mechanics, \nno trader of any kind is likely to escape the notorious lessons of the \nmarket and the costly fees that come with it. The journey through the \nlearning stages is never an easy process and there will be pain and \nhardship along the way. Chances are, quite a few will never surpass \nthis dreaded stage of initiation. On the good side, there is a lot a trader \ncan do to increase his chances of survival, and at little cost to boot: in a \nnutshell, he needs to educate himself properly. \nBear in mind, this is not to suggest that all can be taught from the \ndrawing board; it merely serves to stress the importance of preparation. \nIf the goal is indeed to survive in a field where so many others have per­\nished before their time, how can it not pay to enter well prepared from \nthe outset. \n3 \n",

For some it may take several months of reviewing the same old \nprinciples over and over again, for others the light may turn green much \nsooner than that. But even when all the concepts and techniques are \nstarting to make perfect sense, aspiring traders are well advised not to \ndelve into the markets without a solid plan in place. Lessons need to \nbe learned, but there is little point in allowing one's auditions to be un­\nnecessarily costly or self-defeating. \nNext to jumping in headfirst, hurriedly adopting a third party meth­\nod, just to get going, is another popular practice among many new \nentrants. But when applied as a mere shortcut to education, this ap­\nproach, too, is not likely to hold up in the line of duty, particularly \nwhen the current market environment proves unfavorable to the chosen \nmethod in question. The preferable route, by far, is to always put ample \ntime and effort into constructing a personal methodology, suited for all \nseasons, and devoid of the vagaries and whims of third party discretion. \nAlthough a fully functional and standalone method will be offered in \nthe chapters ahead, and referred to as \"our\" methodology, please un­\nderstand that this is done so for practical purposes and not to suggest \nthat the reader should obligingly apply whatever is put forth. The con­\ncepts and techniques, of course, can serve as a structural groundwork \nfor any customized method. \nIt may take some time and experimenting to find out what style of \ntrading suits a trader best. But regardless of personal preference, all \ntechniques should at least harbor the same objective, which is to ex­\nploit repetition. The first task, therefore, for any student, is to build up \na mental database of price action principles in action. In the following \ntwo chapters we will have a close look at these essentials, from both a \ntheoretical and practical point of view. From there on, our focus will be \non the finer subtleties of trading the 5-minute chart. \n4 \n",

While their variations in appearance are practically infinite, \nas are the ways they can be implemented into a plan of attack, all will \nfind footing in a small set of elementary concepts that repeat over and \nover again in any technical chart.

Schematic illustration of the core principles of price action. \nDouble Pressure \nSince no trader can take his own trades to target, we are all dependent \non the actions and reactions of our fellow traders in the field. Does this \nmean we are mere puppets hanging from the market's fickle strings? Far \nfrom it. But we need to play our game cleverly. Before putting capital at \nrisk on any one trading idea there is an important concept to take into \naccount: for prices to follow through in substantial fashion, we need as­\nsistance from both sides of the market. Should we aim to take position \non, say, the bull side, it may not suffice to only find companions in the \nbullish camp. Preferably, we would like to see a decent number of bears \nquickly bail out to protect themselves from the very rising market we \nare trying to exploit. The more bears forced to buy back their shorts, the \nbetter the odds for our trade to reach its destination before the situation \nsees chance to reverse. \nWhen both bull and bear temporarily join forces on the same side \nof the market-not with similar enthusiasm, we can imagine-we have \nwhat we can refer to as a double-pressure situation. Considering the \nmany seesaw motions in any chart, these imbalances between supply \nand demand are far from unique; but it is fair to suggest also that they \nsooner tend to self-correct than blossom into anything substantial. In \na certain set of conditions, however, double pressure could start to feed \non itself, and this could really set the wheels in motion. Should we see \n6 \n",

      "text": "Chapter 2 \nPrice Action Principles-Theory \nprices head out one way much more than the other, this is generally \nreferred to as follow-through \nRather than responding to its presence, arguably a more promising \nway to take advantage of follow-through is to anticipate its origin so as \nto take position in its primary stage. This implies that these events do \nnot always appear out of the blue. Indeed, it can safely be stated that in \nany session of any market sooner or later the price action will build up \nto a boiling point from where the pressure is likely to escape in double­\npressure manner. To detect these \"sweetspots\" in the chart, the crucial \nboundaries between attack and defense, is essentially what a breakout \nmethod is all about. \nWhile most traders will find merit in the double-pressure concept, \nmany may not sympathize with the idea of trading breaks. Some will \neven argue that in today's tight markets the failure rate of the average \nbreakout (of whatever kind) is so high that this once much-appreciated \nstrategy is now a poor proposition at best. This critique is not entirely \nout of place. Many breaks indeed fail to follow through, and not seldom \nby design. Yet if we learn to make distinctions between the high and \nlow-odds varieties there is no need for pessimism on the part of trading \nbreaks, quite the contrary. In the chapters ahead, we will see hundreds \nof examples of breakouts that should leave little room for argument as \nto their tradability with high odds attached. \nBut in all cases, conditions are king. Even a break in line with the \ndominant pressure runs a high risk of failure if poorly set within the \ntechnical picture. Always more telling than its mere occurrence is the \nway a break is built up. By and large, the best opportunities stem from \na visible fight over the breakout level in question-a number of alternat­\ning bars in which bulls and bears battle it out in a relatively tight vertical \nspan. These tug-o-wars can materialize in any number of ways, but not \nseldom only a handful of bars are needed to recognize the sweetspot in \nthe chart, and with it, the potential for a serious pop. We can refer to \nthese cluster progressions as buildup or pre-breakout tension. \nFigure 2.2 shows a random series of very common buildup situa­\ntions that often precede a breakout of sorts. In a regular chart, these \nsideways progressions may be a little less straightforward (not neces-\n7 \n",

Double-pressure pops after buildup. \nWhile each buildup cluster has a bull and a bear side, in the vast ma­\njority of tradable cases only one will qualify for trading purposes. It \nis interesting to note also that this side is generally the most defined, \nwhich stands to build up the pre-breakout tension even more. At the \n\"non-break\" side, however, the price action can still send out very telling \nsignals and this, too, can play a role in the timing of the break. \nWhen it comes to taking position, the break of a specific bar in a \nbuildup progression could trigger an entry in the market, but this is \nnever a standalone event; there are always more parameters to take into \naccount. To judge any situation in its proper light, a solid understand­\ning of price action principles is essential. \nSupport and Resistance \nIn mainstream Technical Analysis, the concept of support and resis­\ntance is by far the granddaddy of all price technical phenomena. The \ngeneral idea is that the levels in the chart from where prices previously \nbounced may prove their resilience again at a later stage, but will be \nbroken at some point. It takes little charting experience to find merit \nwithin this observation. \n8 \n",

Once broken, these levels often reverse their ini­\ntial roles, meaning that former support may now turn into resistance \nwhen touched from below, and resistance, once broken topside, may \nact as support when touched from above. This, too, is a highly visible \ntechnical phenomenon and it is not hard to imagine how countless \nstrategies are solely designed to exploit it. \nDespite their prominent role in the price action, however, it is best \nto entertain a neutral view on all these peaks and troughs and use \nthem mainly as a source of information. The novice in particular is not \nrecommended to adopt the aggressive contrarian approach of shorting \nformer highs and buying former lows in anticipation of these levels to \nhold up; nor is he advised to blindly long new highs or short new lows \nin anticipation of these breaks to follow through. \nRather than acting on support and resistance straightaway, whether \nfor a break or a bounce, the conservative practice is to first monitor how \nthe market handles itself in and around these levels, and then take it \nfrom there. For example, the perforation of a former high is likely to \nhave more of an impact when the level gets taken out as a result of a \ntug-o-war progression beneath it (buildup). Much less so when prices \ncome up from lower levels and then go straight on to clear the former \nhigh-these type of breaks are known to backfire quite painfully. As to \nthe latter, it is vital to realize that there are numerous parties in the \nmarket whose favorite game is not to trade but to counter the break, \nparticularly those set poorly. \nSupport and resistance levels can serve many purposes, but their \nbiggest virtue is that we can derive from their presence an idea on the \ndominant party in the chart. This is valuable information; not only will \nit point us in the proper direction for our trades, it will tell us also which \nside of the market to shun. For we shouldn't trade against dominance. \nA very effective way to identify the dominant party is to simply follow \nthe overall slope of the market. When a chart is dominated by the bulls, \neven modestly, prices will make new highs on the whole and the bearish \ncorrections along the way will have a hard time surpassing former lows. \n9 \n",

However, we can rest assured that there are \nmany parties in the market who have mastered the art of the counter­\nstrike to perfection. It is what they do all day long. And it is not just \nthe typical break they tend to bully; with equal pleasure they take their \nshots at a rising or falling market by shorting or buying whatever comes \ntowards them. \nWith powerful enemies always on the prowl, we cannot afford to only \nconcentrate on the bright side of our trading ideas-the likelihood of \nopposition demands equal attention. But let us not forget that the con­\ntrarian, too, needs to carefully weigh his prospects before taking his \nchances on defying a break, for no party can ever have his way with the \nmarket unchallenged.

There are two type of breakouts that \nshould at least come across as highly suspect. The most obvious one \nwe will refer to as the false break trap; the second type, less malign but \nstill very much to shun, we can look upon as the tease break trap. Bear \nin mind, it is never the outcome that determines these labels, it is the \nway the breaks are set when they occur. In other words, it is very well \npossible that an excellent break will find no follow-through whatsoever, \nwhereas a terrible break might take off and never look back. In terms of \nprobability, the outcomes are sooner reversed. \nWhether or not to take position on a break is always a function of \nhow well the technical credentials of the chart back up the prospects for \nfollow-through. At least three things demand examination in all situa­\ntions: (a) is the break set in line with the dominant pressure or against \nit; (b) is the market ranging or trending; (c) are there obstacles overhead \nor underfoot that could possibly obstruct an advance or decline. \nWhile these are the core essentials that will determine whether the \nchart conditions speak favorably of the venture (we will discuss their \nparticulars in more detail along the way), they do not warrant participa­\ntion by themselves. Always a mandatory routine before taking position \non any type of break is to assess the way the market behaved just prior \nto the event. If we don't find buildup there, the offer is best declined. \nConsider the three situations in Figure 2.4. All else equal and as­\nsuming the short entries at e were all technically sound in regard to the \ndominant pressure, these situations perfectly illustrate the principle of \nthe false break trap, the tease break trap and the proper break respec­\ntively. \n13 \n",

Difference in buildup prior to a breakout not only affects the likelihood of \nfollow-through, but the level for protection as well. \nEarlier on we stressed the importance of buildup and how it tends to \nplay a determining role in the success or failure of a break. The premise \nbehind this principle is not hard to grasp: the stronger we see a level \ndefended before it yields, the more dominance displayed by the ultimate \nvictors. But there is another good reason why the absence of buildup \ntends to compromise the follow-through potential on a break. It con­\ncerns the placement of the protective stop. \nOn any wager, the level for protection plays a major part in the total \nconcept of a trade. You simply cannot enter the market without a sound \nidea of when to get out in case prices fail to follow through. In all cases, \nthere is a point of no return beyond which a trade has lost validity and \nneeds to be scratched. Obviously, there are no hard and fast rules on \nthe matter and all will depend on strategy specifics and a trader's per­\nsonal perception of the situation at hand.

All entries were taken at point e, but the levels for \nprotection ranged from wide to tight. \nWithout discarding the benefits of a \"wide\" stop per se, we can gen­\nerally state the following: the wider a stop needs to be placed to find \ntechnical justification, the less attractive the breakout becomes from a \ncontinuation perspective, and the more attractive when seen through \ncontrarian eyes.

      "text": "Chapter 2 \nPrice Action Principles-Theory \nFor further explanation, let us examine the tease break scenario in \nSituation 2. Here the bears were offered a somewhat better entry and \na better technical level to protect themselves also. Still, the buildup left \na lot to be desired since it did not really take place at the bottom bar­\nrier of the range progression; the level for protection, too, resided quite \nsome distance away from entry. This type of break is likely to attract \nmore sideline bears than the one on the left, but it still provides decent \nopportunity from a contrarian point of view. \nOn balance, breaks of the tease break variety (and we will see many \nof them) do stand a pretty good chance to follow through, but they may \nnot do so straightaway. Hence the idea of a tease. As seen in Situation \n2, a typical response of the market is to first counter the break in an \nattempt to undo it; but as prices move back inside the range, they may \nthen hit upon the lows of whatever buildup lies higher up. From such \nan area of resistance (former support), prices may edge down again and \neven go on to break the bottom barrier successfully second time around. \nAll of this could play out in any number of ways and in some situa­\ntions a stop may get hit and in others, it may survive. The point is that \nthe tease breakout, despite being less premature than the very poor \nbreak, still poses a big threat to anyone playing the market with a tight \nstop. Since a tight stop will be a key feature within our operating tactics, \nto be discussed in Chapter 5, our focus is best directed towards the \nbreakouts of top-notch qUality. \nAn excellent way to play a break is shown in Situation 3. Now we \ncan truly see the virtues of proper buildup. Not only did this break \nstem from a bamer fight, with bears coming out on top, a breakout \ntrader could now place a stop tightly above the buildup progression. The \nbreakout may still fail soon after, but technically seen, this is the more \nfavorable scenario. \nPleasant here also is that the principle of support and resistance \nmay help out once again should prices at some point travel back up to \nchallenge the broken barrier from below (common practice). Now rep­\nresenting both the bottom of the broken range and the bottom of the \nlatest buildup, the barrier stands a much better chance to fend off the \ncontrarian bulls on impact; furthermore, bulls in position could grab \n15 \n",

That implies double pressure on the sell side again. \nAs we can see, a breakout not only involves a broken level, there are \nquite a few variables, forces and perceptions at work and all need to be \ntaken into account when assessing the odds. The most important mes­\nsage to take away from the above is to simply avoid all breaks that are \nnot built up solidly. \nOn the good side, plenty of breaks are set so poorly that they are \neasy to dodge by anyone with just a basic understanding of break play \ntactics. A non-buildup break as discussed in Situation 1, for example, \nis one such event that is best left alone.

If a subsequent bar takes out the \nbreakout bar in the same direction, this new bar is now the break­\nout bar, and so on.

Should we see the market respond to a bull break with a bearish \nbar and this bar then gets broken at the bottom by another, that gives \nus valuable information also: technically seen, we are dealing with a \nfalse high. It is considered false because the bull break failed to follow \nthrough and was followed by a bear break in turn. \nWhen compared to the failed breakout of a carefully built up pattern, \nthe failed breakout of a single bar is usually of less significance-but \nit is a false break nonetheless.

But when situated at a crucial spot, say, \nin a buildup cluster, a false high or low could be a major tell as to the \nmost likely outcome of the skirmish at hand. Seeing the break at their \nend fail, the parties affected adversely may no longer feel so confident re­\nmaining in position. Should more counterpressure come forth, they may \neven decide to bail out of their holdings. So in this respect, a false high \nor low could be a harbinger of (double) pressure in the other direction. \nTo see how this information can be useful, imagine a situation in \nwhich we are anticipating the market to turn bullishly around in an \narea of support, and so the idea is to participate in a break on the buy \nside; if the price action is currently forming a little cluster of bars going \nsideways in a tight span (buildup), wouldn't it be nice to see the bears \nfirst put in a break at the bottom of this cluster, only to get reprimanded \nby the bulls. This serves a couple of purposes that may prove beneficial \nto the prospects of a bullish turn: (a) seeing the bear break fail, sidelines \nbears may take heed and thus decide to stay where they are-out of the \nmarket; (b) bears in position may get the message also and their idea \ncould be to bail out, if not immediately then possibly on the first bull \nbreak to come along (confinnation of the false low event); (c) at the same \ntime, a number of sideline bulls will like what they see and their deci­\nsion could be to act on the first bull break as well; (d) bulls in position, \nsome of whom may have been on the brink of selling out their longs, \nmay now breathe a little easier again (no selling pressure yet from these \nparties). \nThe more we can imagine these favorable forces to work in concert, \nthe stronger the upside potential. \nUnderstandably, false highs and lows gain in relevance when they \nshow up at crucial levels in the chart. A false low in support will not eas­\nily go unnoticed, nor will a false high in resistance.

With the overall pres­\nsure still up and prices in an area of a former low, we can imagine \nplenty of sideline bulls to be on the lookout to position themselves for \nanother leg up. Aggressive individuals may already fire long straight \ninto the level of the former low in the hopes of an immediate bounce, \nbut such eagerness is not devoid of danger, particularly when coming in \nwith a tight stop.

This not only buys \nus extra time in assessing the situation, our fellow traders can benefit \nfrom the extra information also. Always remember that we want both \nbull and bear to cooperate in our game and for this we need a certain \ndegree of consensus. \nStalling action in the lows of a pullback in a level of support will \nsurely strike attention among many participants. If nothing else, it pro­\nvides a visible indication that sellers are no longer on top of the buyers \nand this could portend a revival of the bullish dominance anytime soon. \nBut caution is still king because the skirmishes in the turn of a pull­\nback can be quite choppy and in them a tight stop is easily found. \nA development that could possibly work as a catalyst for the situa­\ntion to resolve in favor of the bulls is when a bear break fails to extend \nthe pullback and is then followed by a bull break soon after. After all, if \nthe bears cannot follow up on their own break, and then suffer an up­\nside break as thanks for their efforts, that provides a telling clue as to \nwho is calling the shots in the turn. \nWhile false highs and lows can indeed offer valuable information, by \nthemselves they are no reason to act. In Situation 1, a good example of \nhow to have incorporated a false low incident into a trading decision is \nto have entered long on the break of level 3.

And then there are \nthe so-called \"corrections in time\" that hardly retrace in price at all, yet \nare pullbacks nonetheless. Furthermore, since the idea of superior and \ninferior moves is a matter of perception to begin with and highly depen­\ndent on the time frame of choice, we may rightfully ask ourselves who \nis actually countering who at any moment in time in the bigger scheme \nof things. \nNaturally, it is always best to establish a view on these matters from \none's own perspective and a trader's first task, therefore, is to recognize \nthe line of least resistance in his chart. If there is dominance to be de­\ntected in the current technical picture, any decent retracement within \nit is worthy of attention. But there is always a tricky issue to solve: just \nwhen exactly have prices retraced far enough to \"safely\" anticipate a \nfavorable turn? \nIn our discussion on the false highs and lows, we already touched \nupon a reversal technique, which was to trade the break from a small \nbuildup progression in the anticipated lows of a corrective swing (Figure \n2.5, Situation 1 ,  entry above 3). In the following paragraphs, we will dig \na bit deeper into the practice of turning point recognition. \nIn the wide array of pullback reversal tactics, two popular strate­\ngies stand out, both contillning elements that can be implemented in \nour own plan of attack. The most universal approach is to measure the \nlength of the dominant move and then wait for the pullback to retrace \na certain percentage of it. If the trending move is, say, 10 points tall, \nmany traders will wait to deploy their reversal positions until they have \nseen a retracement of about 4 to 6 points, so in essence the conven­\ntional retracement levels of 40, 50 and 60 percent. \nRegardless of how this technique holds up statistically, it is easy to \npoint out its most apparent drawback: with no further discretion built \nin, it needs a relatively wide stop to survive all corrections deeper than \nanticipated. \nTo counter the element of uncertainty to some degree, another popu­\nlar tactic is to wait for the pullback to first reach an area of support \nor resistance within the trending swing-preferably residing at a cor-\n21 \n",

This technique can be referred to as waiting for \na technical test. Since most trending swings will show some form of \nsideways activity on the way up or down, and not seldom halfway or \nthereabouts, corrections back to these levels are highly anticipated and \ncan make for great bounce candidates indeed. \nFor a technical test to earn attention, there is no need for a classic \ntrend/pullback situation. Any kind of correction that hits upon a for­\nmer level of support or resistance, major or minor, can be referred to \nas a technical test and thus harbors within it a potential for a bounce. \nShould one insist on playing a reversal without waiting for buildup, fir­\ning into a technical test is certainly superior over firing into a void. But \nthere is still a large degree of aggression involved. \nA more conservative route, and the one we will explore in more detail \nlater on, is not to buy or sell straight into a retracement spot, technical \ntest or not, but to monitor how prices handle themselves in the poten­\ntial reversal area first. This wait -and -see tactic is based on the premise \nthat most pullbacks will not turn on a dime. On our 5-minute frame we \noften get to see at least one or two, if not many more bars that reflect a \nlittle bull/bear skirmish right in the anticipated end of the correction. \nThis not only allows for extra time to assess the likelihood of the rever­\nsal itself, it builds up the required tension prior to it, and at the same \ntime it tends to offer a better view on the exact level of the break. \nObviously, this is not to suggest that by showing a little more patience \nwe will never get stopped out or tricked into a premature entry-or fully \nmiss our ride, for that matter; but if we aim to play reversals with a tight \nstop, this more conservative route definitely deserves preference over \nblindly buying and selling into the market without waiting for prices to \nstall first.

If we assume both the bounce trade \nat e and the break trade above I to have been protected \"technically\" \nwith a stop below the last distinctive low prior to entry, there are some \ninteresting things to point out. \nOn the trade above f, the last low of significance prior to entry re­\nsided at the level of b. A stop, therefore, could have been placed a little \nbelow the latter. \nOn the bounce trade at e, a technical stop may have been placed \nbelow the first low on the left, below point c. Let us further assume that \nboth traders had the high of d as a technical target in mind. Should it \nhave been met, the aggressive trader, since his entry was lower in the \nchart, may have scored more pip on reaching target, but not necessarily \nmore profit in terms of percentage. To examine this, we have to consider \nthe ratio between risk and reward. For example, should the stop level \non the bounce trade have resided at, say, 16 pip away from entry and \nthe target at 32, then this particular venture would have yielded a ratio \nbetween risk and reward of 1 :2. It is not unthinkable, however, that the \nconservative trader, despite his entry higher up, could also have applied \na ratio quite similar to this. The distance from Ito the target level of d \nmay now only have been about, say, 24 pip, but the stop below b was \nset at a smaller distance also. Should it have resided at about 12 pip \naway from entry, then this too would have yielded a ratio of 1 :2. \nEven when adhering to a \"more conservative\" mode of operation, it \ncan be a fine line between acting prematurely and acting too late; the \nmarket is certainly not always so kind as to grant us the most effec­\ntive entry if only we be patient. There is little point also in arguing over \nwhich approach is the statistically more viable, for all is a matter of \nperception within the situation at hand. From where we stand, we can \ngenerally label an entry more aggressive than conservative when there \nis relatively little buildup involved prior to the break. \nSituation 2 in Figure 2.6 nicely demonstrates what exactly it is that \nwe aim to avoid when waiting for buildup.

As a logical consequence, this unanimous absence of buying \nenthusiasm is exactly what may cause the correction to carry on until \nthe magnet in question is hit. \nNeedless to mention, this is not to say that the magnet will be tested, \nit merely suggests the potential; yet in the marketplace, the mere likeli­\nhood of an event often plays a major role in the development of it. Such \ncan be the self-fulfilling nature of price action. \nObservation has it that this magnet-and-bounce principle is not just \nthe prerogative of the typical trend/pullback situation, it is basically \npresent within any seesaw motion in the chart, even within in the tini­\nest of technical shapes. This then leaves us to discuss how we can put \nthese mechanics to our benefit in regard to future operating tactics. For \nthis purpose, let's have a look at the technical test's more subtle cousin, \nthe ceiling test. \nA good way to introduce its workings is to explore the ceiling test \nprinciple from the perspective of a range breakout situation. The reader \nmay remember the three qualifications used to rank the likelihood of \nfollow-through on these type of events: a terribly, poorly or properly \nbuilt up break. Another way to describe these distinctions is to regard \na break as either very premature, slightly premature or ready-to-go. \nEvidently, our purposes are best served by the latter, since this type \nwill show the desired buildup prior to breaking out. The very premature \nbreak, however, is not likely to cause much problems either; this one is \nso devoid of buildup that we will simply decline it without much further \nthought. With this in mind, the trickiest situation usually regards the \nslightly premature break, which may show just enough promise to trap \na trader into the market a little too soon. \nWhen confronted with a break of this kind (a potential tease break \ntrap), the best course of action, from where we stand, is to decline the \noffer; but we shouldn't take our eyes off the situation just yet-quite \nthe contrary. Should prices indeed fail to follow through on the initial \nbreak, but not fully retreat either, we may soon see the attacking par­\nties give it another shot.

Let's explore some examples. \nFigure 2.7. Principle of the ceiling test at work in a ranging market (both at 5). \nFirst off, to grasp the concept of a ceiling, picture an arch-shaped for­\nmation in the chart and then zoom in on the series of bars that make up \nits top. In Figure 2.7, in Situation 1 ,  progression 1-2-4 depicts a bear­\nish arch. By definition, any arch, before rolling over from the highs to \nthe lows, will show a little sideways progression in the top, even if it is \nmade up of one single bar (pointy arch). The highs of it, obviously, form \nan intermediate top in the chart, but at the same time, the lows of this \ntopping progression form a ceiling, basically a small level of support (3). \nNaturally, in a bullish arch, a U or V-shaped formation, this \"ceiling\" \nlevel would reside at the top of a bottoming progression (floor). For ease \nof use, we will refer to a floor as a ceiling, too. \nBy extending the level of 3 to the right, we can see how at some \npoint a pullback came to test this mini barrier from below (5). This is a \ntextbook example of a ceiling test following a tease breakout, and it is a \nhighly anticipated event. In fact, the mere ceiling test potential is one of \nthe core reasons why the breakout at 4 is regarded premature. \nBut tease break traders may not be the only parties at risk by the \nadverse magnet of the ceiling. Sideline bears who declined the initial \nbreakout may get into trouble also should they too eagerly decide to take \ntheir chances on the first pullback to hit the range barrier from below \n(circle). This approach defies a price technical concept that is best not \ntaken lightly when playing with tight stops: rather than turning around \nin the most obvious level of former support (resistance of the bottom \nbarrier), a bullish pullback is known to gun for the last level of former \nsupport, even when less prominent within the bigger picture (the level of \n27 \n",

This is essentially a function of \nthe magnet effect described above, and by no means a rare occurrence. \nWhere eager players run a risk of an adverse magnet to work against \nthem, patient traders stand excellent chance to benefit from it. Should \nprices indeed bounce back from a ceiling test and then go on to attack \nthe range barrier second time around, this shows a persistence on the \npart of the assailers not likely to go unnoticed. As a result, the defend­\ning parties may now prove more intimidated, and possibly more willing \nto dump their holdings on a subsequent break. \nSituation 2 in Figure 2.7 shows a variant of the very same principle. \nThe arch of interest in this picture is progression 1-2-4. The range high \nis broken at 4, but not from a buildup progression directly below the top \nbarrier; so that puts this break in the tease break category, too (regard­\nless of outcome). \nBy declining the offer at 4, bulls may have had their suspicions \nabout the potential for immediate follow-through, but not necessarily \nabout the bullish prospects in general. It is therefore not unthinkable \nthat they are actually hoping for this tease break to fail. After all, should \nprices indeed be forced to retreat, their typical tendency is to be sucked \ntowards a level of support back inside the range (low of 5 put in a ceiling \ntest with the highs of 3). And that could serve as an excellent platform \nfrom which to launch another upside attack. \nNote that this particular \"ceiling\" (a floor in a V -shape) is not really \nlocated in the deepest part of the 1-2-4 arch; but since this level repre­\nsents the last level of former resistance inside the range, it is the first \nmagnet of interest to qualify as potential support on the way back from \nthe tease breakout, and we can refer to this as a ceiling, too. Aggressive \nparties may already buy straight into this level in anticipation of an im­\nmediate bounce (5); more conservative players may want to see how the \nmarket handles the test first, and take it from there; others may decide \nto remain on the sidelines until they actually see the top barrier of the \nrange broken second time around (point 6). \nNone of the above is to suggest that tease breakouts are merely a \npostponement of a superior break later on, but it is very common prac-\n28 \n",

Corporate banks, central banks, institutions and \nhedge funds are the typical big parties competing heavily with one an­\nother in the Forex arena. There is no point in trying to figure out these \nparties' motives for doing what they do at any moment in time.

On a bigger intraday frame, say a 2 or 3-minute \nchart, the relevant levels usually move up a notch and we often get to \nsee the price action zigzag between the so-called \"20-levels\" (1 .2600, \n1 .2620, 1.2640, and so on). But arguably the most notable round num­\nbers in any currency chart, and the ones we will sharply monitor on our \n5-minute frame, are the full and half cent numbers, for example 1 .2600, \n1 .2650 and 1 .2700.

From the \npleasant safety of the sidelines, it is our task to detect and assess the \nvarious hints and clues that may point in favor of one side more than \nthe other, all of which will be covered as we go along. \nWhether the direction of the market is indeed a result of superior \ncontestants throwing their weight around, or just a consequence of all \ncombined activity is basically irrelevant. For what it is worth, no party \ncan ever have his way with the market like a neighborhood bully. Even \nthe big players know very well that at any moment in time they might \nrun into a bigger bully themselves and get hurt in the process. On top \nof that, they are only human and just as susceptible to follies, false per­\nceptions and tactical trading errors as any ordinary trader trading from \nhis home. Therefore, rather than being intimidated by these powerful \nparties, we should welcome their presence, for without their volume, \nprices are not likely to move substantially anytime soon. \nA very interesting consequence of round number focus is that these \nlevels, too, tend to work like technical magnets. If a trade sets up prop­\nerly, in line with the dominant pressure, there is arguably no better ally \nto get double pressure going than a 00 or 50-level about 20 pip out. \nThis too is a variant of the earlier mentioned magnet effect. By the same \ntoken, however, the pull of a major round number could work the other \nway around, to the detriment of a trade; we can refer to this as the ad­\nverse magnet effect. \nTaking both mechanisms into account, one of our primary goals is to \nset up our trades in line with a favorable magnet, while trying to avoid \nthe adverse pull of a 00 or 50-level as much as we can.

On occasion, we may al­\nready enter before our pattern line itself is taken out, but more common \nis to hop along shortly after the event. \nThe first breakout situation is a good example of the latter. Note how \nbar 3 opened more or less on the pattern line (low of the white body), \nthen went down a bit, only to close bullishly outside the pattern (high \nof the white body). This was a token of bullish resilience, but no crucial \nbar was broken yet. The very moment the high of bar 3 was taken out, \nhowever, bulls didn't waste time buying themselves in, leaving plenty \nof bears little choice but to quickly buy out. A classic double-pressure \nsituation. (From what is shown on the left of this chart, it's hard to say \nwhether this truly called for action.) \nWhile there are countless ways to snap up prices in a pullback (4-6), \nthe conservative route is to wait for the correction to hit upon a techni­\ncal element in the chart (a test of support or resistance), and then see if \nprices can find some footing in it (buildup). If you take position merely \non account of an attractive retracement level, say, a 50 percent correc­\ntion of the foregoing swing, you are basically resorting to tactics of the \nhope-and-pray variety. Buying or selling straight into a technical test is \nnot without danger either, for prices may very well march through it, if \nonly to shake out the partles who came in with a tight stop. Hence the \nrecommended approach of waiting for some bars to settle in the area \nfirst. \nThe 1-3 cluster from where the first bull swing had taken off is a \ngood example of an area of technical support. On balance, the thicker \nsuch a block on the left, the harder it will be for prices to fully cut \nthrough it on their way down. \nQuite like an angular line can help to mark a boundary of interest, \nwrapping a box around a cluster of neighboring bars can be very useful \nalso, particularly when dealing with a potential reversal in the high or \nlow of a pullback.

When this bar was \ntaken out topside, so too was the resistance of the box pattern, the \npullback line, the 25ema and the round number. Such a confluence of \nbroken sweetspots present in a single breakout stands to work to the \nbenefit of follow-through simply because it will have many traders focus \ntheir attention on the very same break; and contrarians are less likely \nto counter such event. \nIt took some pushing and pulling in the current highs of the market \n(double top 8-9), but once bar 9 was broken down, bulls finally let go \nand a bearish pullback ensued (9-10). Note that this correction only \nretraced about 50 percent of the foregoing swing 7-8, an indication that \nthe bulls were keen on keeping the pressure up. \nWhile conservatism in the markets is highly promoted, it is always \na pleasant fact that many parties have no problem with aggression. \nFor example, the typical buying of the proverbial falling knife on a 50 \npercent correction can be indirectly beneficial to the breakout trader's \ncause, for this kind of bravery is necessary to slow down the pullback's \nmomentum, so as to set the stage for a sideways phase from where a \nmore \"conservative\" trade may sprout. \nA rather effective way to anticipate the break from this buildup is to \nmonitor closely the current low of the pullback and the first high that \nfollows it.

There is no way of \nknowing, of course, how many bars will show up in the box, but each \none will add to the pre-breakout tension.

But a mere break of a box bar­\nrier, even at the favorable side, may still not suffice to attract sufficient \nparticipation. Always preferable is to first see some extra tension in the \nbox prior to the breakout; buildup within the buildup, so to speak. At \ntimes, this final tension can be subtle to detect, but it is never a matter \nof \"feel\". The bars will always guide the way. \nLet's take a closer look at how this second box was built up. The lO­\nI I  upswing was the first bull attempt to end the correction, but it didn't \ntake long for bears to take over again and short prices back to the for­\nmer low: a common seesaw motion in the potential turn of a pullback. \nVery interesting was to see bar 12 briefly break below bar 10, only to be \nbought up instantaneously, and quite aggressively at that. A textbook \ncontrarian trap. \nNot long after this false low incident, with prices pulling and push­\ning back inside the box, bar 13 provided another technical tell of \nsignificance. This bar, too, first surpassed the low of its little neighbor \n(technically a bearish feat) and then closed strongly up. This not only \nprinted another false low in the chart, it put a higher low in the box. If \nwe compare the implications of bar 1 3  with those of bar 7 earlier on, we \ncan already see some nice price technical repetition at work. \nThe second box took twice as long to break as the first, but in many \ninstances this only enhances the likelihood of a double-pressure pop. \nAfter all, the more trading done within the buildup, the more parties \ntrapped on the wrong side of the market when prices finally break out, \nand their flights to safety can only add to the breakout pressure. \nAll this is not to suggest that the break trade above bar 13 was a \nguaranteed winner, but with (a) bullish pressure in the overall chart, \n(b) prices in a 50 percent retracement zone, (c) a false low at 12, (d) a \nfalse and higher low at 13, (e) an upside break of a box pattern, and (t) \nthe 50-level magnet hanging above, at least the prospects for bullish \nfollow-through were excellent.

Coming up from well below the 25ema and with no \nbuildup prior to breaking through, activity like this is known to raise \nsuspicion among a wide variety of participants. For this reason, these \nrallies may not make for the best of continuation candidates on any \nfirst pullback correction. This is not to promote rebellion against the \npressure itself, but before playing along, we better find out first how the \nmarket handles this situation. Chances are, we are not the only ones \nwho need extra time to absorb and assess the implications. \nAnother element of concern was the fact that prices had taken out \nthe 50-level on the way up but not tested it back since. This doesn't \nhave to be an absolute deal-breaker, but on balance, the less built up \nthis initial perforation, the stronger the adverse magnet potential; just \nan extra incentive to be a little more cautious on the bull side. \nWhen the first serious correction set in (3-4), bulls successfully de­\nfended the intermediate low of 2, which created a double bottom at 4: a \npraiseworthy feat in open defiance of the round number magnet. With \nthis supportive element in place, the bulls' next task was to get the bars \ntrading back above the 25ema again, so as to visibly reclaim their tech­\nnical advantage (4-5). \nThe 5-6 progression is essentially a ten-bar skirmish over the pos­\nsession of the average. Within it, bulls repeatedly bought themselves in \nfrom the base of the 25ema, but as soon as prices headed out a little, \nthey were shorted right back. Something had to give. When yet another \nstrong bearish bar popped up (6), the bulls were the first to call it a \nday, which then led to the 6-7 correction. From a conservative sideline \nperspective, none of this may have set up a trade yet, but the series of \ndescending highs in the UK morning session did allow for a very fine \npattern line to be plotted and extended for future purposes. \nNote: When putting in pattern boundary that spans at least several \nhours, it is easy to plot it slightly off, particularly when the highs or \nlows of relevance do not line up so neatly.

At times, you may have to adjust it a \nlittle along the way in order to find a better alignment with the follow-up \naction. If your pattern line has become invalid or redundant, erase it to \nkeep the chart clean, but do not do so immediately when prices break \naway: the extension of the line could still play a role in a pullback situ­\nation. (Will be taken up in Chapter 5.) \nSince we shouldn't have been looking to short this chart, there was \nno real reason to put in the horizontal line here. It is plotted to show \na textbook example of a false break trap (7). As we can see, bulls may \nhave given up on the 25ema support below bar 6, they were quick to \nreturn when bears came to pierce the double bottom lows of 2-4. Rec­\nognizing very well the absence of buildup, contrarian parties simply \nresponded by doing what they love to do most, which is to counter the \nnon-buildup break. This tactic worked out wonderfully well and now \nleft a triple bottom in its wake (2-4-7). \nIronically, just a few bars after the failed break through support, \nbulls let themselves get trapped in almost identical fashion, in the high \nof bar 8. Although more in line with the overall pressure, this break was \nof poor quality also. Now prices had come straight up from the lows, \nonly to break out with virtually no pausing (buildup) underneath the \npattern line: not a great way to set a break either. Once again contrar­\nian parties stepped in, this time anticipating a failure of the bulls. As \ntrapped bulls hurriedly sold out, this added to the bearish pressure of \nthe 8-9 swing. \nFailed perforations at either end of a pattern are very common in­\ndeed and they clearly illustrate the danger in playing breaks without the \nbackup of buildup. How about another false break at 9. \nObviously, these stand-off situations can't last. Sooner or later, one \nside will force its way through the defense of the other. But how can we \ntell a tradable break from a potential trap? By following closely the pres­\nsure in the bars.

Bar \n10 is a good example (and so was bar 6 earlier on) . Granted, when bar \n10 was broken topside, prices were still trapped within the bigger pat­\ntern, but the event did let on that the bears were once again beaten in \nsupport, and this time with buildup. That basically put the overhanging \npattern line next on the agenda. Time for a conservative breakout trader \nto sharpen up the focus some more. \nThere is another form of buildup that can really put the pressure \nup. Whenever prices in a potential breakout area are capped on one \nside by a pattern line and on the other by the 25ema, we have what \ncan be referred to as a squeeze situation. Although this chart is actu­\nally not the best candidate to introduce this highly effective form of \npre-breakout tension, it does show us, prior to the breakout, one tiny \nbar squeezed tight between the pattern line and the average (bar 1 1). \nPreferably, squeezes contain at least two or three, if not many more \nbars, which can really make the tension coil up like a spring. We will see \nplenty of examples soon enough. \nVery interesting also was to see the break above bar 1 1  stem from a \nW-pattem, progression 8-9-10- 1 1 . When such a potent pattern is posi­\ntioned favorably within the price action, it is widely known to portend \na breakout on the bull side (as is its bearish counterpart, the M-pattem \non the bear side) .

We will take up their appearances and implications in more \ndetail in the discussions and chapters to come. \nTo top it off, this pattern breakout found itself assisted by a very \npowerful ally. Have a look at how the round number of 1.38 literally \nsucked prices in from the moment the \"proper\" break was set. Not a \nbear in sight until the level was hit upon.

Not only did this show \nbullish resilience (or bearish weakness, if you wish), it put a false low in \nthe chart.

When compared to \nthe break of bar 5, the break above bar 7 was of much lesser standing, \nif not plain unsavory. \nThe 25ema by itself never provides support or resistance, it is just \nan average. Yet in the continual seesaw motions of price action it is \nextremely common to see a pullback of about 40 to 60 percent coin­\ncide with the average closing price of the last 25 bars-and not seldom \nwith some form of technical support as well. The low of bar 7 is a good \nexample: it tested both the 25ema and the high of bar 5 and this simul­\ntaneously represented (a) a ceiling test (floor in the 4-5-6 arch), (b) a \ntechnical test of a former breakout and (c) a 60 percent retracement of \nthe forgoing swing 5-6. This type of \"obvious\" support will surely have \ncontributed to the aggression with which the low of bar 7 was bought \n(a popular scalper's tactic).

On balance, the \"further away\" entry is taken \nfrom the average, the more riskier the trade, particularly when using \ntight stops. Even in a trending market, prices will always try to correct \ntowards the 25ema, which basically turns the average into a perpetual \nmagnet. With this tendency in mind, one of the most effective filters you \ncan build into you trading method is to allow prices, in the vast major­\nity of cases, to reach the average first before participating on a venture \naway from it. Such simple selectivity stands to improve the odds for a \nsuccessful start of your trade most dramatically. \nAnother issue to take into account is the shape of the flag in rela­\ntion to the size of the pole. When a relatively small flag hangs from a \nrelatively large pole, participants may view the relation between the two \nas a bit \"off' and thus be reluctant to trade the break of the flag. This \nconcept is related to the principle of harmony and we will take it up in \nmore detail in the section on our entry techniques in Chapter 5. \nA flag break of the poisonous variety is shown below bar 4. Not only \ndid this break originate from a rather small flag (in relation to its pole \n1-2), just look at the distance away from the 25ema-that is huge! \nAnother thing that strongly contributes to the danger of trading a \npremature break is that contrarians are always on the lookout for them \nand, rest assured, they do possess a very keen eye for their favorite play. \nIn other words, next to finding few companions to get his poor break \ngoing, the premature trader stands to encounter lots of participants \nof the dreaded other camp. Further adding to his troubles is the often \ntreacherous behavior of his fellow traders at the first signs of faltering \nfollow-through. Consider the 5-6 maneuver.

In practice, however, such symmetry is quite exceptional, and \nnot very relevant either. In the vast majority of cases, the element of \nmost significance in the W-pattern is not the right leg, but the middle­\npart progression following the left leg (2-5). The blockier this cluster \nshows up, the more likely that bears will bail out on an upside break of \nit. Moreover, when this block shows a powerbar on the right, as was the \ncase with bar 5, bears with tight stops may not even wait for the middle­\npart's high to be taken out; they may use the break of the powerbar to \nexit immediately.

By remaining calm and \nattentive, a bear could assess that none of the favorable elements on \nwhich his position was based had been overthrown by that bullying bar. \nThe trend was still down, prices were still below the 25ema, the round \nnumber could work as resistance and so could the ceiling test with the \nlow of bar 7, which was also a technical test of a former breakout. \nGiven all the violence from earlier on, it may seem a bit odd that no \nfurther follow-through came forth in the new low at 9, but it is actually \nquite common.

It took a \nlittle skirmish in the round number, and a mini false high at 5, but then \nthe bulls were forced to retreat, and not much later prices were pushing \ndown against the bottom barrier once more (6). \nAt this stage, we can imagine the bears to have felt pretty content \nwith the way things were going. Not only had they successfully fended \noff the first bull attack in the EU Open (T -5), the overall pressure still \npointed pleasantly south and prices were now favorably positioned in \nthe low of the market again. Little did they know they were in for a rude \nawakening. \nIronically, even though the powerful 6-F bull surge had crushed all \nbearish hopes for further decline, it ended with a classic bull trap of its \nown (F). Notice also that the F-8 response was a virtual mirror image of \nthe T -4 response at the other end of the range. \nWhen confronted with a failed breakout, the attacking parties basi­\ncally face two options: they could either retreat in full or give it another \nshot. Apart from market pressure, an element that tends to have large \nsay in this matter is whether the initial break was set with or without \nbuildup. In case of a non-buildup failure, as shown at T and F, chances \nare good that the attackers will want to give it another try. \n61 \n",

That would have turned the high of bar 3 in a false \nhigh, or a tease break if you wish. But when not much later the high \nof 3 was hit again, and prices retraced from it, a new double top was a \nfact (3-4), which allowed us to experiment with the barrier as depicted. \nWith all the bars closing above the 25ema, bulls had kept the best of \nthe action since the start of the EU Open at 08:00, but prior to the UK \nOpen at 09:00 their dominance was far from outspoken. Their task was \nevident, though: to get prices trading away from that round number. \nLet's examine how it was done. \nFollowing the double top of 3-4, bar 5 had dipped briefly below the \n25ema but managed to close above it; a little sign of bullish resilience. \nIt was also a higher low in the box. \nFrom the tiny base of bar 6, bulls had forced their way through the \ntop barrier in powerbar fashion (T). These tease breakouts can be a \nbit tricky at times. On the one hand they lack solid buildup, but they \nmay not be completely devoid of appeal; this could leave many breakout \ntraders confused on whether to hop along or decline. From where we \nstand, tease break perforations are best considered premature, but we \nshould never lose track of the follow-up action. \nEarlier on we addressed the authority of the powerbar and its pow­\nerful implications when broken; equally interesting is this bar's little \ncousin, the so-called inside bar.

Particularly when the bar is situated \nat a crucial spot, its break is known to trigger quite a few traders in and \nout of position. With this tendency in mind, another way to look at the \ninside bar is to regard it as a one-bar buildup progression. \nAlthough the majority of bars in this chart were all of modest span, \nthere were some interesting inside bars to be detected. How about bar \n6, as a prelude to the powerbar breakout at T; and bar 7, from which \ndownward break the market responded with a pullback to support. And \nhow about bar 9, which set up a pullback reversal in the top of the bro­\nken range. \nBar 9 was indeed an interesting bar. It presented itself bullishly next \nto bar 8, which had just performed a very telling feat of its own: the low \nof bar 8 had put in what we can refer to as a triple. This is a simultane­\nous touch of a pullback on the 25ema, a round number and a technical \ntest of sorts. Since the low of bar 8 hit upon the high of bar 6, the tech­\nnical test here was a ceiling test. \nIn a bullish chart, a triple represents threefold support, and plenty of \nbulls love to buy straight in it. In a bearish chart, a triple is likely to get \nshorted. However, it is the element of the technical test more than that \nof the 25ema and the round number that earns the triple's true bounce \nreputation (principle of support and resistance). This is why we very \noften see prices fail to bounce \"properly\" in a weak double (25ema and \nround number), where the technical test is missing. A double of, say, \na 25ema and a ceiling test may already hold up much better because \nof the technical test within (strong double). But triples are definitely the \nmost potent of bounce generators. For a recent example of an excellent \ntriple, check the previous chart, Figure 3.8: the triple is found where the \nlow of bar 8 hits upon the 25ema, the round number and a technical \ntest with the highs of the 4-7 cluster. \nWhen there is no round number involved, but instead the pullback \n64 \n",

More user-friendly and \nsafer also is to use the bracket order option. As the name suggests, the \nbracket encloses an open position by having both a target and a stop \nautomatically attached to the level of entry. Both sides of the bracket can \nbe set to any desirable distance and each will close out the position when \nhit. A nice feature of this order type is that when one side gets hit, the \npending order at the other end instantaneously gets cancelled. Hence \nthe bracket also being referred to as an OCO (one-cancels-other). \nFollowing are the suggested settings for a standard bracket on the \neurjusd 5-minute in accordance with the trading method to be dis­\ncussed in the next chapter. The target side is set at a distance of 20 pip \nfrom entry, the stop at a distance of 10. \nThese settings are not merely chosen for their ease of application. In \na normally active eurjusd session, a 20 pip target complies fairly well \nwith an average double-pressure pop from a buildup situation that is \nlikely to have our interest. As to the 10 pip stop, to some readers this \nmay seem awfully tight, but it is thoughtfully chosen as well: it allows \na trade some room to breathe, but not to the point of hope-and-pray. \nObservation has it that if we position ourselves on a break in line with \ndominance, carefully selected and stemming from a buildup situation, \nthere is usually little to be gained by setting protection at a level further \nout. Hundreds of trade examples in the chapters ahead will aim to vali­\ndate this bold premise. \nTo ensure a protective exit at all times, the stop-side of the bracket \nis a market order too; when hit, this order will close out the position no \nmatter what. Inherent to the use of a market order is the occasional is­\nsue of slippage. This happens when an order gets filled at a price worse \nthan intended due to the fact that the market moved disadvantageously \nin the split second it took the platform to work the order request.

On occasion, slippage may even work to one's advantage. \nIn any case, never consider swopping the market order for a limit \norder to cheapskate on protection. This could turn out to be a costly \nmistake if no counterparty is found to fill your trade at the desired exit \nlevel: prices could march straight through your stop without ever tak­\ning you out. For this reason, most platforms do not even provide a limit \norder option at the stop side of the bracket. At the target side, a limit \norder will do. \nWith a 10 pip stop and a 20 pip target in place, spread and/or com­\nmissions included, these settings are said to show a ratio between risk \nand reward of 1 :2. In other words, if we get stopped out twice for each \ntime our target is hit, this will yield a break-even result over time. More \nencouragingly, if one winner is pocketed for every one loser incurred, \nthings are progressing in very promising fashion. \nNote: Certain bracket order settings can hold up for ages, but it is \nwise to evaluate at regular intervals whether the current market condi­\ntions still justify the settings of the past. For example, should intraday \nactivity significantly pick up, or even go haywire like in the height of the \neuro crisis back in 2008/2009, it may very well be that the standard lO \npip stop would no longer suffice. A simple solution could be to set the \ndistance for protection at a wider level (while taking off some volume to \ncompensate). Should we adjust the target level more or less proportion­\nally, we can even maintain a similar risk/reward ratio as before. (For \ninstance by setting the stop at 13 pip from entry and the target at 26, \nand so on.) \nVariations on the bracket order theme are easy to implement. It is \ncertainly not a requirement to have the target level at all times double \nthe level of the stop. Should a 20 pip target be deemed acceptable but \na 10 pip stop too tight, setting the latter a little wider is always an op­\ntion, even on a discretionary basis. Of course, this will affect the risk/ \nreward ratio. \nAs an alternative to a preset target, a trader could decide to let the \nprice action determine when it's time to cash in a profitable trade.

In most instances, a single line or \na box is all it takes to stay focused on the development at hand. \nOnce we have established a visual on a boundary of interest, our \nnext task is to monitor how well this barrier holds up when raided. As \nwe know, a mere perforation may not call for action yet (think tease and \nfalse break traps), but things always get interesting when attackers and \ndefenders start to battle it in a tight group of alternating bars push­\ning up or down against the barrier. Within this buildup we then need \nto identify a crucial bar-the bar from which break to take position. In \na textbook example of a bull-side breakout, this will be a bullish bar \npositioned at the end of the current cluster, with a close against the pat­\ntern barrier. When a subsequent bar takes out this bar at the top, the \npattern defense is now considered broken and we can enter long at the \nmarket.

In the early \nstages of it, in the absence of a dominant party, there may not be much \ntelling who will come out on top. But by patiently monitoring the way \nthe price action revolves around the average and by carefully tracking \nthe highs and lows along the way, we can usually obtain a pretty good \nidea on the side of the market that is slowly getting the upper hand. \nThe first notable event in the session above was the sideways \"cor­\nrection\" 2-3, hanging from the pole 1-2. Horizontal pullbacks are the \nmarket's way to absorb the implications of a foregoing move. Inevitably, \nat some point, prices can only do one of two things: they either break \naway in the dominant direction (think flag), or they break away at the \nother end, possibly setting up a reversal of sorts (think M and W-pat­\ntern middle-parts). \nBears will not have been amused to see the latter outcome come \nabout (4). Just moments before they had been well on their way to the \n50-level below, only to suddenly see their opponents aim for the round \nnumber above. (Note the completion of the W-pattern in the 3-4 swing.) \nFollowing this countercharge was a lengthy skirmish over the pos­\nsession of the 25ema, which ultimately resolved in favor of the bears. A \ndevelopment that may have played a decisive role in this victory was the \nfact that bulls, despite repeated attempts, had proved unable to reach, \nlet alone retake, the round number of 1 .36. At some point these misad­\nventures were bound to affect their morale. \nBut let us zoom in on the initial bull attack first (4). When the ave-\n78 \n",

From here on, prices may still have a hard time reaching higher, \nbut they do stand a pretty good chance of getting picked up whenever \nthey hit back on the average, particularly on first touch; and even more \nso when this coincides with an element of technical support. \nIn a rather slow and compressed session, support or resistance is \nnever far away. For example, when the low of bar 7 hit upon the high of \nbar 5, this was a spot-on ceiling test that coincided with a touch on the \n25ema and a 50/60 percent correction of the 5-6 maneuver. In an ear­\nlier discussion, we referred to this threefold collision as a triple: a strong \nturning point candidate. Scalpers in particular love to take advantage \nof these little pullbacks to support, if only to rake in a handful of pip in \nthe initial bounce. But for prices to head out more authoritatively, or \nlastingly, decent sideline assistance is usually required. In the session \nabove, this never convincingly materialized for the bulls. Not long after \ntaking possession of the average, they were twice forced to retreat below \nit (8-9 and lO- l l)-and then failed to recoup third time around. \nNote: As previously noted, there is no point in overanalyzing every \nlittle skirmish in the chart; most of the time there are no trades near \nand it will do to sit back with just an overview perspective on the open \nsession.

But whenever we see one side repeatedly fail to make it to their \nmagnet and then lose the initiative, a power shift is likely at hand. Put \ndifferently, the failure of one side to reach their round number very often \nsets the stage for a successful attack on the number at the other end. \nThis is essentially what happened in the chart above. Moreover, the \nfailed attempts to reach the OO-level-at 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, and finally at \n12-will not only have had an impact on the bullish morale, they will \nhave boosted the confidence of the bears with equal prowess. \nInitially, the pattern line may have been plotted slightly more as­\ncended to connect the 2-3 element with the low of bar 9.

Those who stepped in on the break of bar 4 (better \nalready) may soon have regretted their purchases also. \nTroubling the bulls here was the fact that the 1-2 rally had been so \none-sided (no stalling on the way up) that it failed to offer a decent level \nof support for a pullback to gun for and turn around in. In such cases, \nthere is usually less consensus on where to pick up the reversal, even \nwhen plenty of bulls are aiming to buy. And as the buying thus comes \nin less unanimously, prices tend to respond less unanimously also. The \n25ema can sometimes help out, as it tried to do at 4, but without a \ntechnical element to coincide with its slope, the supporting powers of a \nmoving average are usually little more than an optical illusion. \nAs it turned out, it needed a deeper pullback for the bulls to come \nout and defend the opening rally with a little more verve (5-6). Even \nthough the tiny bottoming tail of bar 6 was not a great marker of bullish \nenthusiasm yet, bears did take heed of this bar's message, if only for \nthe fact that prices now resided in the notorious 60 percent retracement \nwne of the 1-2 rally: a last resort for the bulls to keep the pressure up. \nTo the careless eye, progression 6-8 may seem like a nondescript set \nof little doji bars; but if we examine the action more closely, these bars \ntell us the interesting story of how the bulls and bears fought it out in \nthe lows of that pullback.

Perhaps not a perfect \nsqueeze, but there was little room to move without breaking out either \nway, and this always adds to the tension. \nA development that favored the bull breakout was the fact that the \nentry bar (above the arrow) had first taken out the low of its direct \nneighbor only to reverse strongly up (false low).

When doing so, it is good to realize that a free path out is \nprobably more rare than common. A former swing high or low may not \npose too big a problem; double tops and bottoms can be a little tougher \nto crack but need not necessarily be feared when not too prominently \ndisplayed in the chart. Never pleasant, though, are fat, blocky clusters \nof price action not too far to the left that need to be eaten through to get \nto target. (We will see plenty of this soon enough.) \nAs to the bull trade in question, there was little call for pessimism \nwhen aiming for a 20 pip target; in fact, there were two eventualities \nlikely to help the trade along: first there was the magnetic pull of the \n50-level to get prices going, and then there was the former high of 2 to \nfinish off the job.

Whenever a cluster of bars shows up between two opposing \nelements, of whatever kind, this always raises the tension-and sooner \nor later demands a conclusion. \nLet us zoom in on this seven-bar squeeze to find out if we could \nhave seen the break below bar 13 coming. To begin, the buildup had \nstarted out with the 10- 1 1  bull swing, which was a perfect ceiling test \nwith the 8-9- 10 arch, and also a failure of the bulls to reach the 50-level \nmagnet. As prices fell back to the pattern line, bulls quickly responded \nby swinging them back up (higher low). But before the high of bar 1 1  \nwas reached, prices fell back to the pattern line once more (lower high). \nWith now two false highs in the squeeze, and prices closing bearishly on \nthe pattern line as well (13), the situation had reached a critical phase. \nShould bar 13 be broken at the bottom, not only would this technically \nconfirm the false high in bar 12 (bull break followed by a bear break), \nit would show that sideline bulls were no longer able, or willing, to de­\nfend their pattern line support. And that left the bulls in position highly \nexposed, possibly prompting many of them to bail out to keep their \ndamages small. Couple that to the bearish outlook, and we indeed have \nall the ingredients here for a nice double-pressure pop on the sell side \n(enter short on the break of bar 13). \nNotice that our entry bar, below the arrow, did not sell off right away. \nEvidently, even in the face of a solid break, contrarian parties can be \nvery resilient. But do not let this disturb you. A bit of pulling and push­\ning in the breakout area is all part of the game for dominance. Whatever \nyou do, avoid exiting in the entry bar itself. Nine times out of ten that will \nbe a fear-based exit, and a poor one at that. Also, with a stop safely in \nplace, what is there to fear? This is not to suggest that an open position \ncannot be validly exited before either the stop or target is reached, but \nbailing out in the entry bar is seldom a valid display of such technique. \nFor now, let's just stick to a rigid application of the 20/ 10 bracket and \nsee what that brings. \n85 \n",

An excellent starting point is \nto monitor the directional efforts of the 25ema. Is the average sloping \ndown, with most bars traveling below it, we are currently dealing with \na southbound market and our trades are best chosen in line with this \nslope (lengthy flag-type corrections may form an exception). \nAnother way to get a dependable idea on the pressures in play-and \nvery handy also when the average is running more or less flat-is to \ntrack the last so many arches in the chart and see how they relate to \none another. Figure 5.3 demonstrates how this can be helpful. Starting \nfrom 07:00, we can count four arches standing in support of the round \nnumber of 1 .33: progressions 1-2-F, F-3-T, T-4-5 and 5-6-7. As is often \nthe case, the first arch is the biggest of the series and the rest gradually \ngoes down in size. Sometimes an arch in the middle will be the most \nprominent, as in a head-and-shoulders variant, but whenever there is \na smaller arch following, the implications are basically the same. Natu­\nrally, the last arch is the one to observe with most attention for detail, \nparticularly when compressed. Not seldom this arch is so flattened out, \nas was the case with the 5-6-7 progression, that it is hardly recogniz­\nable as an actual arch (think squeeze). Needless to say, all this applies \nto a bullish chart also, with V-shaped arches hanging below a barrier, \nworking up to an upside break. Furthermore, we will not only find these \narches standing on or hanging below a horizontal barrier, they can just \nas well reside beneath or on top of a tilted pattern line.

When dealing with a multiple-arch formation in the mak­\ning, we usually get fair warning as to when to sharpen our focus. For \nexample, even though the false break at F, the tease break at T and the \nfalse highs at 3 and 4 were all interesting elements to detect, none of \nthem got us anywhere near a trade at the time. In the end, all we had to \ndo was keep a half eye on the action until things called for a little more \nattention, probably somewhere around bar 5. \nAlthough in most sessions we can usually tell the bullying party from \nthe underlying one in little more than a glance, we should never make \nassumptions on the outcomes of their battles. What we can do, howev­\ner, is promise ourselves not to trade in favor of the oppressed for as long \nas their underlying status has not been set straight. In the chart above, \nthe down-sloping 25ema and the shrinking arches clearly let on that \nthe bears currently had the best of the action; in fact, bulls could do \nlittle else than bravely defend themselves against the repeated attacks \non the round number of 1 .33. Without thinking short yet, this tells us \nthat all bets on the buy side are off for the moment. \nAs is very common in a: round number fight, there were incidental \nperforations below the level but they did not lead to immediate collapse. \nAlways keep in mind that round number defense can be very tenacious \nand perforations seldom follow through without at least some form of \nbuildup backing up the charge. \nNotice that the false break at F was no cause to redraw the box yet \n(its falseness validated the prior low of 1); but when later on the lows of \n5 and 6 came to match the low of F, the barrier could have been lowered \nto the level of the dotted line (now ignoring the break at T). It remained \nto be seen, though, how indicative a mere break of this \"tricky\" barrier \nwould be with the round number still very much in play. While it could \nnever hurt to put the level in, this is one such situation in which we \nshould be extra cautious not to get trapped into a premature break; a \ncareful tracking ofthe buildup in the round number area is paramount. \n87 \n",

Perhaps a less conservative bear may \nhave deemed this a good enough signal to have fired short straightaway, \nas opposed to waiting for bar 8 to close and be broken by another bar. \nBut that would have left the squeeze rather thinly built up. In most \nsimilar situations, and in the tricky environment of round number de­\nfense in particular, my advice would be to sooner wait for an extra bar \nto fatten up the squeeze than to act on a somewhat premature break \nin fear of missing out. In this view, the entry below bar 8 is the more \ntextbook pattern break short. \nIf fear of missing out is an issue in your trading, causing you to act \nbefore your turn a little too often, consider concentrating on indisput­\nable breakouts only; a great benefit of this approach is that you can now \nvalidly skip all breaks that do not qualify as such, without feeling upset \nif they do follow through. \nGranted, since there are no absolutes in trading, at times there can \nexist a thin line between a \"proper\" break and its premature counter­\npart.

In \na pullback reversal, on the other hand (as opposed to a bigger pattern \nbreakout), the break in the turn may set up much faster and it may \ntake no more than a single bar for a setup to earn validity status. (Will \nbe taken up later in this chapter.) \nSituations like the one above show us also that it isn't necessary to \nalways work with a nondebatable pattern line and a perfect signal bar \nto match it. The general idea is to trade off the most cmcial bar in the \nbarrier area.

Furthermore, the bars \nin it had built up considerable tension prior to the upside break.

Yet this doesn't necessarily render the event \ntotally untradable. By keeping close track of the post-breakout action, \nwe may still be offered a chance to hop on board in second instance. \nTwo such situations deserve our full attention. The first is when \nprices, after breaking out, start to cling around the broken barrier, not \nknowing whether to follow through or prove the break false; obviously, \nthis is an indication of defender's resilience, but at the same time it \nshows that the attacking parties are not so easily demoralized either; for \nas long as this fight persists (buildup), there is still a reasonable chance \nfor the market to break away in line with the earlier break. \nThe other situation of interest is when prices do follow through on \nthe original breakout, but then pull back to challenge the area of the \nbroken barrier. \nEither situation knows many subtle variants and all could set up a \ntrade in line with the original break.

Despite the striking similarities on the whole, the \ndifferences between a tradable and non-tradable break (in first instance) \ncouldn't be better illustrated.

But our chances to participate were not lost. \nThe price action on top of the pattern line shows the unmistakable \nfeatures of a bear-flag formation: a slightly tilted progression hanging \nsideways from a strong bear pole (1-2). In such a pattern, a series of \nascending lows may give off an impression of demand.

We can \nrefer to this as the pole-flag-swing principle (a lightning symbol, if you \nwish). Whether or not one fully abides by this premise, the break of a \ndecent flag pattern is always worthy of attention. So let's have a look at \nhow this one came about. \nIronically, just prior to the event, after four hours of pushing and \npulling within the flag, bulls had finally managed to stay on top of the \n25ema for a number of consecutive bars (6-7), but then the tables sud­\ndenly turned (bar 8). \nNote also that it was a false high in bar 7 that set the stage for the \nflag breakout at the other end. As bears jumped in and bulls jumped \nout, powerbar 8 completed the right leg of an M-pattern reversal (4-\n5-6-7 -8). With the 6-7 middle-part hanging ominously above, sideline \nbulls no longer bothered to defend the pattern line as done on previous \ntouches. Prices sank straight through. \nThis leaves us to examine the details of the pattern break pullback \nentry below bar 9. For starters, pullback 8-9 had retraced about 50/60 \npercent of the breakout swing 7-8. In doing so, bar 9 had not only put \nin a triple with the pattern line extension, the round number and the \n25ema, the high of this bar had put in a ceiling test with the lows of the \n6-7 block. Notice also that even though bar 9 had bullishly perforated \nthe pattern line from below, its close was back outside of the pattern, \nand very bearish to boot. This clearly let on that both bull and bear had \ncleverly made use of the 8-9 bounce, the former to sell out, the latter to \nsell in. \nIn technical terms, bar 9 set up a valid second-instance short, but \nthere is one little issue here that almost spoilt the fun. This signal bar \nstood relatively tall, which meant that the entry was offered quite a few \npip away from a potential retest of the adverse round number magnet. \nThat can be tricky for our stop. However, let us not discard any such \noffer too easily. When the technical picture speaks highly in favor of im­\nmediate continuation, as it did above, it is perhaps a risk worth taking \n(a personal call, of course).

I be­\nlieve this was the case also with the short below bar 6. \nFirst off, progression 4-5 had retraced about 100 percent of swing \n3-4 and had done so quite aggressively (three bullish powerbars); this \nalone already put the potential reversal in the less desirable corner.

Particularly when the break is set straight into a \ntrending 25ema, as was the case below the dotted line, double pressure \nagainst dominance can be very short-lived, if forthcoming at all (mind \nthe contrarians!). In other words, while a bull can be forgiven to have \nexited his long, this was certainly no place for a bear to play short. \nRecalling the principle of false highs and lows, a failed break on one \nside of the market could be a harbinger of a successful break on the \nother, especially when the latter is set in line with dominance. With this \nin mind, it is hardly surprising to see new bulls come in when bar 4 was \nbroken topside. Earlier on, we referred to this technique as trading a \nbreak for failure (see Figure 5.5). In a favorable chart, this can be a very \nlucrative practice, but is best explored with solid breakout experience \nunder the belt. (More on this in Chapter 7.) For now, the break of bar \n4 can be rightfully skipped in anticipation of some more pulling and \npushing in the round number area. \nWhenever a pattern boundary gets broken (2-5), traders need to \nmake up their minds on the validity of the event, in essence, whether to \nhop along, counter, or let the situation pass. When consensus appears \ndivided, but the break itself is not undone, not seldom this leads to the \nforming of a smaller pattern outside the broken bigger one (5-7). \nIn contrast with the foregoing pattern break pullback examples, pro­\ngression 5-7 was much less angular, almost flat, and quite nondescript; \nbut it was a pullback nonetheless and its purpose was to test the va­\nlidity of the bigger pattern breakout. Well supported by a bullish triple \n(round number, barrier extension and 25ema), the first bullish bar in \nthis mini flag could already present itself as a signal bar for another \nbreakout. So attention is key. \nThe first bar to be taken out on the upside was the one at 6. Al­\nthough small as a bar can be, this was a valid signal bar. It originated \nin the lows of the pullback and in the presence of the bullish triple as \n104 \n",

Furthermore, bar 6 was a miniature false low with its neigh­\nbor on the left, a feat that was technically confirmed when the next bar \n(our entry bar) came to take out its high (first arrow). \nOnce again prices were reluctant to move out, but they .did not re­\ntrace much either. When caught in a noncompliant trade right after \nentry, always stay calm, trust your stop, and give the market a fair \nchance to work things out. As a rule of thumb: at least for as long as \nthe 25ema holds up in line with your trade, the odds to see prices take \noff favorably are very good still. And in this stalling phase, tension can \nonly build up. In many such scenario, at some point we may even be \nable to anticipate the exact spot for the market to resolve the situation; \nfor example, when bar 7 showed up, there really was no more space left \nin the squeeze between the overhanging flag line and the 25ema. Some­\nthing had to give then and there. \nIn retrospect, an entry above bar 7 is probably superior to the one \nabove bar 6; after all, the buildup was now extended with two more \nbars and there was a flag line perforation to help the bull break along. \nNeedless to say, there is never any way of knowing that a few bars down \nthe line a \"better\" setup will show up. But then again, if good is good \nenough (and it is), that is irrelevant also. Standard operating tactics \ndictate that we have to accept the first valid offer to come along. \nShortly after the small' flag was broken, bar 8 briefly tested back \nthe breakout, which was also a touch on the round number magnet. If \nfor some reason not yet in position, a bull could make use of this mini \ncorrection to quickly buy himself in, without waiting for another bar to \nbe taken out first. Since this practice overrules standard procedure, it \nis to be used sparingly and as a last resort only; we could look upon it \nas a belated entry on a break that was somehow missed just moments \nbefore; it is definitely not recommended as a clever way to cheapskate \non a fill, for example by deliberately skipping a valid break in the hopes \nof finding a more economical entry on a slight pullback reaction. Even \nthough this \"trick\" may work out here and there, saving yourself a pip \nor so each time you get away with it, you only need to miss an entry \nonce on what could have been a pleasurable 20 pip ride and you can \nstart all over again being smart. \n105 \n",

All of this is dependent, of course, on the situation at hand and on \nhow flexible a trader is when it comes to his entry and exit techniques. \nThere is certainly no law that says you always have to trade your breaks \nwith a 10 pip stop and a 20 pip target. \nFigure 5.9 shows a multiple-arch formation on top of a respectable \npattern line (arch 1-2-3 followed by head-and-shoulders 3-7). Progres­\nsion 4-7 was the flattest arch in the range so far; in the top of it there \nresided a small series of topping tail dojis, a clear token of resistance \n(5-6). Maybe it was too early to already think short, but it was evident \nthat bulls had run into strong opposition. Bar 7 certainly didn't change \ntheir situation for the better. \nThis chart example shows a third application of the pattern break \npullback setup. In the first version, we covered the angular pullback \nto the broken pattern line (Figures 5.6 and 5.7). In the second, we saw \nprices stagnate a little outside of a broken pattern (Figure 5.8).

This could \nbe the result of a line being plotted slightly off, but is a regular occur­\nrence also even when deaii'ng with a nondebatable slope. As to the line \nin question, it looks okay the way it is drawn (overruling the low of 3 in \nfavor of more touches further up). \nBar 7 left little to the imagination as to the bears' intentions, but the \nlack of buildup on the pattern line rendered the bar invalid as a signal \nbar. The low of this bar held up anyway, since bulls immediately retali­\nated with a counterattack in bar 8. While deserving credit for curbing \nthe initial breakout, bulls now faced the resistance of the 5-6 bear block \nabove; this left them quite exposed and in need of assistance. \nRight in the opening bell of the EU morning (08:00), help did arrive \nand for a brief moment in time bar 9 must have shown a brave and vic­\ntorious bullish body.

It then took a \nmere break of this bar to bring capitulation about. \nIsn't it nice that we can watch all this unfold from the pleasant safety \nof the sidelines. By letting the other parties do the fighting first (build­\nup), all we have to do is time the entry on the break, should one come \nforth in tradable fashion (enter short below bar 9). \nNote also the favorable position of the 50-level magnet. Provided en­\ntry is taken away from buildup, a round number about 20 pip out can \nbe a very powerful ally in the total concept of a trade (it surely isn't \ncounterproductive). Of course, round numbers can make for nasty op­\nponents as well (3). It's all a matter of perspective. \nPattern Break Combi \nThe pattern break combi harbors many features of both the regular \npattern break setup and the pattern break pullback variant. The suffix \ncombi is referring to a two-bar pattern, a powerbar followed by an inside \nbar. The possible combinations that make up this duo are plenty, but \nthe message is essentially the same in all: the powerbar displays direc­\ntional pressure, the inside bar builds up tension next to it. In conditions \nthat favor the direction of the powerbar, it is the inside bar that func­\ntions as our signal bar. \nEven though a combi breakout is often acted on in relative isolation \n(inside bar tactics), the follow-through response is generally the stron­\ngest when the combi is part of a bigger breakout of sorts. Hence the \npattern break combi. \nFigure 5. 10 shows a number of standalone combi setups; the first \nthree are bullish, the last three bearish. Note that the last example \nshows a reversed combi, meaning the inside bar came before the pow­\nerbar; interestingly, this doesn't have to affect the implications of the \npattern itself. To see why, imagine the taller doji on the right to be \nbroken at the bottom by a third bar: that would technically confirm a \nfalse high (bull break followed by a bear break), which harbors bearish \nimplications of its own. \n108 \n",

Yet another version is to see the small inside bar \nreplaced by a powerful doji. \nPreferably, the color of the inside bar's body, if not a neutral dash, \nis the same as that of the powerbar. Favorable also is when both bars \nshare the same high or low at the breaking end (double-bar break). But \nthese features are not a specific requirement for a combi pattern to earn \nsetup status. For example, it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker to see a \nbearish inside bar alongside a bullish powerbar, as long as the inside \nbar is still situated in the higher region of the powerbar. \nAnd lastly, should a second inside bar pop up next to the first, this \ncan only add to the tension; therefore, all else equal, the implications \nof a three-bar combi are the same as those of a regular two-bar combi \n(perhaps even stronger). \nIn the majority of combi breakouts, position can be taken on the \nbreak of the inside bar, but on occasion it may be an option to postpone \nentry until the powerbar is taken out also.

While all is indeed a matter of per­\nception, there is never much reason to get caught in a very conspicuous \ntrap, as in the bull break at 4, or the bear break at 6. \nThe breaks of combi 2, 5, and 7, stemming from buildup, all pos­\nsessed merit, yet it seems fair to have questioned whether they set up \nthick enough to have anticipated a 20 pip break. \nTo understand the distinction between \"thin\" and \"fat\" setups, let us \ncompare for a moment the cluster progressions 1-2 and 6-7 with the \nbuildup leading up to the combi in the ellipse (8-10). The latter definitely \nshowed a lot more substance. Note also that prior to breaking away in \nthe ellipse, bulls had taken possession of the 25ema first, meaning their \nbuildup resided favorably on top of the average, which wasn't the case \nyet at 2 and 7.

As will be demonstrated in the long series of \nconsecutive charts in Part 2, the first decent trade of the EU/UK morn­\ning is likely to be found in and around the UK Open, when there is \nusually sufficient volume being pumped around to back up the break. \nHowever, do avoid shoddy breakouts or anything that sets up as a con­\ntinuation trade in the high or low of a swing leading up to the UK Open. \nThese type of breaks are more likely to provoke rebellion when the first \nwave of volume pours in. \n1 13 \n",

Combi 1 ,  for example, \nrepresented a typical bull trap, quite like combi 3 in our previous chart, \nFigure 5. 12. Before stepping in on a thin break like this, it may help to \nask and answer two essential questions first: (a) does this look like an \noffer that many other bulls would want to accept? And (b) how demoral­\nized are the bears at this point; would they rather throw in the towel on \nthe break at 2, or open up new shorts? \nAs always, the true answer will only be known after the fact, but we \ncan usually gather a fair view on the most likely outcome simply by fol­\nlowing pressure, conditions and buildup. \nHow about the break of combi 4? Small as a combi can be, this one \npossessed a little more merit. Not only was the combi favorably posi­\ntioned in the base of the 25ema, it found technical footing in a small \npattern line extension. Even so, since the market had only just sprung \nup from the lows, it would have been rather optimistic to have antici­\npated immediate continuation at this point. And there was overhead \nresistance to deal with as well (pattern line extension of former highs). \nAn offer to have declined for sure was the break of combi 5. If we \nnow consider the preceding bull swing 3-5, which had come up from the \nlows with little pausing on the way, this pattern breakout had all the \nmakings of a tease break trap. \nCombi 5 did possess an interesting feature: the high of the inside bar \nresided slightly higher than the high of the powerbar. This is actually \nquite common in a combi setup and does not have to affect the implica­\ntions of the pattern itself. The reason for declining the break was simply \nthe poor buildup preceding the event. \nThe market did manage to break out for a handful of pip (6), but \nthen follow-through dried up and a correction set in. On the way back, \nit was only when prices had reached a 60 percent retracement of the \n3-6 swing that bulls came in with more verve (7). Note the ceiling test \nbounce when the low of bar 7 hit upon the high of bar 3. \nThis brings us to the combi setup in the first ellipse.

In this case, the extra bar was an \ninside bar and thus formed a combi setup with its powerful predeces­\nsor. An added bonus here was to see both highs in the combi line up, \nwhich set up a double-bar break. \nIn the meantime, the 25ema had come to support the inside bar from \nbelow, basically turning the latter into a one-bar squeeze. With the right \nshoulder of the head-and-shoulders pattern now \"rounded\", and prices \npushing up against a pretty straightforward neckline (ignoring the tease \nbreakout), it wasn't hard to locate the sweetspot of the moment.

Each time they had come to attack the highs of the session, \nthey were forced to retreat almost instantaneously. Bar 3 was a double \ntop with 1 ,  and bar 4 a false high with 3. A similar fate befell bar 6 when \nit came to take out the high of 4. But was it any wonder? Look how \npoorly built up these bull attacks on the highs were deployed. \nIf a single former high or low can already form a technical magnet, \nthen range barriers can do so even more. It is therefore not just the \nbreakout trader who runs a risk of getting trapped in a false break \nevent; any player who trades within the range with a protective stop a \nlittle outside of it can get trapped in equal fashion. Consider the pre­\ndicament of a bull who had \"safely\" placed his stop a few pip below the \nlow ofT. And what about a bear who had placed his stop above the high \nof 3 or 4. The message is clear: when the action shows a high degree of \nfickleness, it is best not to pick sides until things truly build up. \nSeen in this light, the bull break of combi 5 was best left alone, and \nso was the bear break of combi 7, although of better quality in terms of \npressure. \nTaking into account the length of breakout swing 6-8, pullback 8-9 \nwas just too shallow a correction for bar 9 to set up a valid pattern \nbreak pullback short. Not only would the break below this bar offer an \nentry far removed from the 25ema, lurking above was a ceiling test mag­\nnet with the low of combi 7, if not a round number test a few pip higher \nup. Whenever there are conspicuous adverse magnets still on the radar, \ntraders may be less willing to play the turn of a pullback in fear of the \ncorrection not having run its full course yet. This is why it is so prefer­\nable to have these magnets \"out of the way\" prior to taking position, the \n25ema touch in particular. \nFrom 10:00 to 1 1  :00, the market formed what can be referred to as \na bear-flag variant (flag 8-12 hanging bearishly from the pole 6-8). So, \nnot only had the bulls to weather the implications of the broken head­\nand-shoulders formation, now adding to their troubles was the danger \nof a pole-flag-swing situation: the flag breakout could trigger a response \nequal to the span of the 6-8 swing. And the almost tangible pull of the \nbig 1 .35 level certainly didn't help their cause much either. \n1 19 \n",

In an act of utter rebellion, they had even successfully \nfended off the OO-level magnet by hammering out a double bottom of \nsorts (8- 10). But alas, this only provided the bears with more economi­\ncal levels to short from. As a result, prices never put in that ceiling test \nwith the low of combi 7, and they never made it to the 25ema. \nAs much as the bearish dominance was evident, the activity within \nthe flag didn't really build up in a very compressed fashion as seen \nin some of our earlier flag break examples. Nor was the flag line itself \nof very fine quality (arbitrarily drawn). In most such instances, when \nsticking to conservative tactics, this would render participation invalid. \nOn occasion, however, the odds for follow-through on a certain break \ncan appear attractive enough to justifiably deviate from standard op­\nerating procedure.

Granted, the 25ema had yet to be properly tested, \nbut with no less than four consecutive bearish dojis building up tension \nin the flag (combis 1 1  and 12), it is fair to deduce that the bullish defi­\nance was wearing awfully thin. Think of it this way: if you were a bull in \nposition, would you sit tight and hope for the best below combi 12-or \nwould you gracefully accept defeat and get out of the way? \nConservative traders can of course skip, but it's hard to argue with a \nbear for taking a chance on a short like this.

This illustrates \na concept that we have touched upon in an earlier discussion: the form­\ning of a small flag outside the boundary of a bigger pattern. Should this \nsmaller flag be broken as well, this shows a failure of contrarians to \nundo the break of the bigger pattern and thus sends out a strong con­\ntinuation message. \nNote: Not all traders adhere to the breakout strategy. A very popular \nplay is to buy or sell straight into a technical test. For instance, side­\nline bulls may have liked the outlook enough to already have bought \nthemselves in on the low of bar 7 the very moment it touched upon the \ntriple. This tactic differs strongly from our own but is not necessarily \nwithout merit. In fact, in this particular case one could argue that if an \nentry above bar 4 was valid but missed, the breakout trader, too, could \nnow pick up an entry in the low of bar 7, so as to correct the mishap \nof missing his break at no extra cost. Although it is hard to battle the \nlogic within this reasoning, any entry is always best judged in the light \nof the current circumstances. In that respect, before progressing into \na flag pattern, the 5-6 cluster had shown the bearish features of an \nM-pattern middle-part. Therefore, for us to have bought the low of bar \n7 would have been in defiance of this bear block development. So yes, \nit can sometimes prove beneficial to have missed an entry on first go: \ninstead of being positioned in a noncompliant trade, we are offered a \nchance to re-evaluate the situation from the safety of the sidelines. (In \nthe long run, of course, missing our breaks will surely backfire.) But \nthis then brings up another issue. What to do in bar 7 when already in \nposition on the initial break above bar 4? After all, by declining entry in \nbar 7, we basically suggest that the original bull wager above bar 4 had \nlost validity. And that implies that we should have scratched the trade \nbelow bar 6. Frankly, that may indeed have been a valid option, but we \nwill look at this in more detail in Chapter 6 on Manual Exits. \nTo summarize on the above, if the market shoots away from a missed \nbreak and no immediate second instance entries are offered (like a mini \npullback in the entry bar itself, or maybe in the bar after), the best way \nto deal with the mishap is to simply accept that it happened and not \nlook upon it as something that needs to be corrected.

The combi in the ellipse was reversed, meaning \nthe \"powerbar\" came second to the inside bar, but such order does not \naffect the implications of the setup itself (enter long above it). \nWas it an option to already have taken position above the first bar of \nthe combi, the bullish inside bar? Opinions may differ, but that would \nhave set up the break quite thinly; although residing in the pleasant \nsupport of the 25ema and the pattern line extension, that little bar was \nthe first to defy the blocky pattern overhead, and not too intimidating \nat that; not a great marker of bullish enthusiasm yet. With the doji bar \nadded, the situation had definitely changed for the better. Notice also \nthat this bar had first taken out the inside bar at the bottom, only to \nturn around and close high up (false low). Always a favorable element \nwhen thinking long. \nAbout an hour later there appeared another interesting combi setup, \na three-bar variant (9- 10). The two inside bars following powerbar 9 set \nthemselves up outside of a broken flag progression (8-9), while building \nup tension towards another bullish pop. In strict technical terms these \nbars were not really inside bars (sticking out a bit), but they did build \nup tension and set up a nice double-bar break. But what about the sur­\nrounding conditions? Were they as favorable as they had been on the \nfirst combi trade? \nTo answer this, let's start out by comparing the technical support \nunderneath this setup with that of the earlier combi on the left. Imme­\ndiately we can see a major difference in backup. The combi in the ellipse \nrested on the fat cluster of progression 1-4, while being guided along \nby the 25ema. Beneath the three-bar combi 9- 10, on the other hand, \nthere was no support to be found, at least not within the range of our \nstop. Instead there were two adverse magnets that stood good chance \nto meddle with the trade: the 25ema about 12 pip below entry and the \nDO-level a few pip further south.

By the look of that huge bar, it is safe to deduce that this particu­\nlar bull spike had come about as a result of such a release. It takes little \ntime in the markets for any trader to understand that these events can \nreally tear the technical picture apart, and cause great slippage on both \nentry and stop.

In many such cases we can trade the \"reversal\" as if dealing \nwith a regular pattern break setup (or a variant of it). \nThe correction in price is usually more diagonally shaped.

At least four reasons come \nto mind why this mini break did not deserve entry signal status: (a) the \nbreak was directed against the pressure of a little bull block to the left \n(4); (b) it went up against the resistance of a pullback line; (c) the 25ema \nhad not been properly tested (no buildup in the turn); and (d) no techni­\ncal tests were hit upon in the high of the pullback yet. \nNone of this may have called for aggression on the buy side, but \nthese were valid reasons to lay low on the sell side. \nEqually poisonous was the perforation of the pullback line a few pip \nfurther south. When aiming for a reversal, it is crucial to realize that \nthe pullback will possibly do everything in its power to postpone, if not \nfully fend off, the moment of the turn.

For example, in bear swing 1-3, bar 2 represented a tiny one-bar \n\"hiccup\" in the downtrend, essentially a bullish reversal attempt that \nhad failed.

A pullback reversal that needs to \nsurpass the barrier of a range to get to target is likely to meet more op­\nposition. The session above shows reversals of either kind. \nThe trend variant came about as a consequence of the 3-4 correction. \nThis pullback was diagonal and orderly (black bars only), had retraced \nabout 50 percent of the 1-3 swing and was the first to reach the 25ema \nsince the break of the box in the left hand corner. Since the foregoing \nturn at 2 had been rather swift on our 5-minute, the chart failed to pro­\nvide a textbook ceiling test (no floor to bounce off), but the 3-4 pullback \nhad found support nonetheless, which formed a higher bottom. The \nindisputable pullback line was a welcome bonus too, and so was the \nlovely combi setup squeezed tight beneath it (5). \nA nonfavorable element may have been the adverse magnet of the \nOO-level; although the lows at 2 had come real close, the actual test \nwas still left open. However, with both the environment and the set­\nup speaking in favor of continuation, this was of minor concern only \nand certainly not disruptive enough to skip the trade (enter long on the \nbreak of combi 5). \nHow about the 7-9 retracement. This was another pullback to the \ntrending 25ema, but we can immediately see that the conditions in \nwhich it showed up were not nearly as favorable. First of all, the pro­\ngression was not a neat, one-sided diagonal retracement to the average \n(the bullish upstroke at 8 had turned the pullback into a two-legged \n130 \n1.305 \n-1 .355 \n",

As a matter of \nfact, the neckline of this progression (low of the box) was broken by the \nvery same bar that treacherously posed itself as a signal bar for a pull­\nback reversal long (9). \nWhen we have both bearish and bullish elements in place (reversal \nelement in a trending market), the general consensus on the situation \nis likely to be divided. A problem this is not, because we do not have to \ntrade. Nine times out of ten, the best side is neither short nor long, but \noutside of the market (skip bull entry above bar 9). \nBut how about pullback 1 1- 12. This retracement wasn't as gentle as \nthe 3-4 correction earlier on, but when compared to the powerful bear \nrally before it ( 10- 1 1), the countercharge wasn't overly aggressive and \nas such may have qualified as a reversal candidate. However, there was \na good reason also to decline the offer below bar 12: the surrounding \nconditions were unsupportive. \nIf we solely concentrate on the bear rally preceding the pullback, \nthe trend was unmistakably down and maybe there was more of this to \ncome. Yet if we zoom out to address the bigger picture, we can see that \nprices were actually residing in the lower part of a much wider range. \nIn fact, the low of bar 1 1 , a spot-on round number test, represented a \ndouble bottom with the low of the box on the left. In other words, even \nthough the collapse of the earlier bull trend was beyond dispute, with \nprices now in the lower region of a range this was not the best environ­\nment to look for bearish continuation. To better understand the dangers \ninvolved, let us briefly recall the typical forces in play in the lower region \nof a range: bears take profits, sideline bears stay away and contrarian \nbulls might come in any moment. \nThis is not to suggest that we cannot trade a pullback reversal within \na range, but we do have to be more picky about it. particularly when \nprices plummet straight down from the top of the range to the bottom \n(7 - 1 1, or 10- 1 1 ,  if you wish), we definitely shouldn't be too eager to play \nfor more continuation near the lows. \nWhile nimble scalpers may have been able to extract some quick \nprofits in the turn below bar 12, or thereabouts, powerbar 13 depicts a \n/3/ \n",

Granted, this trap scenario is \nnot unthinkable even in the best of reversal breakouts, but it is all the \nmore common in a nonfavorable environment, and with the pullback \nalready not the prettiest to begin with. \nFor future purposes, it is recommended to examine for a moment \nhow this trap came about. Note that contrarian parties didn't immedi­\nately come out to counter the bearish intentions below bar 12. Instead, \nbears were \"allowed\" to enter the ring and even enjoy some follow­\nthrough on the way to their 50-level magnet: so far, all quiet on the \nsouthern front. Until suddenly, somewhere around the halfway mark \nof the 1 1-12 swing (very typical), contrarians came in full throttle with a \nmerciless powerbar that singlehandedly set the stage for the upcoming \nbull-side reversal (13). \nDo realize, though, that such a powerbar is never solely a marker \nof contrarian prowess; bears, too, will have contributed to the nature \nof it, as they toppled over one another in their hurried flight for safety \n(double pressure).

One benefit of the trend is beyond ques­\ntion, though, and that is that it clearly tells us which side of the market \nto shun. \nAlthough printed as a continuous curve, the 25ema has a closing \nprice just like any regular bar. Since its slope is a reflection of the av­\nerage closing price of the last 25 bars, it cannot help but lag behind if \nsuddenly a frantic wave of buying or selling takes the current price bars \naway from the mean. In order for the average to catch up, so to speak, \nprices either need to pull back towards it or they need to go sideways \nfor more than a bit and put in the so-called correction in time. A good \nexample of such a sideways correction is illustrated by the bull-flag for­\nmation 1-4, hanging from the high of the UK morning bull rally. \nIn a more range bound market, it usually doesn't take very long for \na decent pullback to hit upon the 25ema. In a strong trend this may \nnot be the case for many hours on end. Although our core strategy is \ndesigned to trade off the 25ema \"base\", there is no rule that says we \ncannot deviate from standard procedure.

Of course, trad­\ning is never a game of semantics. The only reason to accept a trade at all \nis simply because the odds favor a positive outcome. \nAs we know from earlier discussions, to qualify for a breakout it is \nessential for the flag to express a certain ripeness in harmony with the \npole from which it hangs. We also took up that it's hard to determine the \nideal presence of this concept. But maybe we can obtain a better under­\nstanding by imagining its absence first. For example, should we picture \nthis flag to already have been broken above, say, bar 2, this would have \nmade for an uncomfortably small flag in relation to the might of the bull \nrally. (Apart from the fact that such an entry would have been way too \nfar removed from the average to accept.) \nIt is important to understand, though, that the idea of harmony is \nnever a matter of bars per se, it is a function of the number of sideways \nbars relative to the strength of the flagpole. Flag progression 5-6, for ex­\nample, was a nice flag in relation to its pole 4-5, even though it showed \nonly a three-bar body before breaking out. \nAs already mentioned, popular perception has it that when a flag \ngets broken, this could induce a new swing more or less equal to the \nlength of the flagpole. There may be some debate on the exact points \nfrom which to calculate this, but this doesn't take away from the pole­\nflag-swing potential itself. Therefore, whenever we see a flag take on \n\"sufficient\" body, this could portend the coming of a very interesting \nbreakout. \nTo determine whether progression 1-4 could boast of such pleasur­\nable characteristics, let's examine the available hints and clues up to \nthat point. First off, the overall pressure was indisputably up. Second, \nthe flag was the first decent pullback since the start of the bull rally. \nThird, a premature break at T had been fended off by the bears, but the \nsubsequent correction had not surpassed the earlier low of 3 (the higher \nlow after the tease break indicated bullish resilience). Fourth, progres­\nsion 3-4 showed the blocky features of buildup. Fifth, bar 4 had put in \na false low with its neighbor before spinning around and setting up as \na bullish signal bar. \n135 \n",

And \nthen there was a slight issue with the flag line which may not have been \nbroken yet on the break of bar 4 itself (depending on how sharply that \nline was drawn by our fellow participants). Nevertheless, considering \nall the elements that favored continuation, and with the flag itself more \nand more a token of 50-level defiance, I believe we should just bite the \nbullet here and accept. \nIf not in position on this flag break trade, or possibly already on tar­\nget, could we deviate again from standard procedure so as to pick up \nthe flag break entry above bar 6? And what about an entry above bar 8? \nConservatively regarded, both are easy skips. In a strong trend it is \ncertainly not unthinkable to see some follow-through on these smaller \nflag breakouts-and if already in position, it is always a pleasure to see \nthem break-but by themselves both entries would have demanded a \nserious violation of standard operating tactics. Just look at the distance \naway from the 25ema base. On the break above bar 4, we deliberately \nstrayed from the regular path on account of the excellent prospects (big \nflag, first pullback); to do the same on subsequent wagers, of lesser \nquality also, could be asking for trouble. \nIn the 9- 10 correction, the intermediate lows of 6 and 8 were taken \nout, but in the light of the bullish dominance these were minor breaks \nthat weren't likely to harm the prevalent pressure. More interesting, \ntherefore, was the fact the bar 10 had put in a technical test with the \n3-4 cluster, thereby taking care of the only adverse magnet of signifi­\ncance in the area. Once this test was put in, it took only a couple of bars \nfor the market to set up another pullback reversal (enter long above \ncombi 1 1). \nPrior to taking any position there are always two type of dangers to \nassess: adverse magnets on the way to the stop and obstructive ele­\nments on the way to the target. While adverse magnets deserve caution \nby default, if only as a consequence of a tight stop strategy, obstructive \nelements on the way to target are best judged in relation to the market's \ncurrent strength.

That's a valid question for sure, but I leave it \nup to the reader to answer it. Personally, I am not a fan of meddling \nwith an open trade in an attempt to gun for more profits than originally \nintended. But it's hard to argue with anyone taking a different view on \nthis matter.

Not only was there zero buildup in this turn, there was also a strong \nrisk of the 50-level adverse magnet. \nBulls bravely marched on beyond the round number and soon hit \nupon the high of bar 1 at 5. As is quite common, the former high offered \nresistance and although it took some pulling and pushing in the area, \nultimately prices were forced to retreat, leaving a triple top in their wake \n(1-5-6). Not long after, the 6-7 correction hit upon a supportive triple \nof the 25ema, the round number and what looked to be a 40 percent \nretracement of the 3-5 bull swing. As bears laid low in this tricky area, \nbulls were given ample chance to regroup and plan another charge on \nthe top barrier defense. \nThe break of bar 7, however, was not a good place from where to \nlaunch this new attack. Prices may have pulled back to the average, \nand bar 7 may have been a turnaround bar in it, and even a false low \nwith its direct neighbor, there was neither trend nor buildup to back \nup this charge. Instead, there was the 5-6 bear block directly overhead \n(M-pattern middle-part). \nAbout an hour later, the 50-level defense was much more estab­\nlished. Despite the overall thinness of the \"correction in time\", both bar \n9 and combi 10 had managed to put in a higher low, and bar 8 a false \nlow with 7. Furthermore, if we zoom out a little, we can see that the 7 - 1 1  \naction was actually part of a much bigger pattern, the bull-flag 5-1 1  \nhanging from the pole 3-5. \nAlthough the current development favored a bull break more than a \nbear break, the offer above combi 10 can be qualified as premature still. \nConsidering the subdued action of the moment, and with the bigger flag \nline yet to be broken (dotted line), it just wasn't very likely that prices \nwould shoot off like a rocket here.

Looking closely, this pullback reversal harbored \nall the makings of a pattern break combi setup as well. \nIf we compare the break of combi 1 1  with the break of bar 7, both at \nthe same price level, this nicely demonstrates that skipping or accepting \nan offer never comes down to price, it is always a function of pressure, \nbuildup and conditions. And another thing: whereas the top barrier of \nthe range was likely to act as resistance to a break above bar 7, on the \nbreak above combi 1 1  it stood to work as a favorable magnet. Simply as \na consequence of the better buildup. \nThis example suggests also that, given certain conditions, a barrier \nbreakout can indeed be anticipated from a level well within the range. \nEven though prices may still have to surpass the outer barrier to get to \ntarget, at least the position will be pleasantly in the plus on impact. Fur­\nthermore, there is usually less need also for a substantial break to reach \ndestination. And not uninteresting either, should the barrier level prove \ntoo hard to crack, the current profits on the trade provide reasonable \ncushioning for the position to be scratched with minimal damage, or \neven for a profit still.

But we also addressed the fact \nthat, particularly in a tease break scenario, the pullback is not neces­\nsarily halted by the barrier level itself; prices are often seen to break \nback into the pattern to put in a ceiling test of sorts. \nRegardless of whether a tease break correction remains outside of \na broken pattern or travels back in, things usually do not differ much \nwhen it comes to assessing a pullback reversal or pattern break pull­\nback setup. In all cases we have to monitor the behavior of the pullback, \nthe amount of retracement, the harmony aspect and the potential level \nfor a ceiling test bounce.

And what if a sideways cluster of \nbars gets broken against an open position; should we just stay in and \nhope for the best, or would it be more wise to intervene and close out \nthe trade before more damage is done? \nIn this chapter we will try to shed some light on these matters, but it \nshould be noted that if we venture out on this more discretionary path, \nthere is no escaping the occasional gray area of arbitrary contempla­\ntions that may raise more questions after the fact than provide answers \nbefore it. On the good side, if any of the following for some reason seems \ntoo impractical to be put to good use, it can always be discarded. By \nsimply applying a nonnegotiable bracket on all your carefully selected \nwagers in the market, the results should already be very promising. \nBut let this not stop us from reviewing some highly effective inter­\nvention techniques that at some point may come in very handy in the \nfield, possibly even on a daily basis. They are: (1) exiting a trade with a \nnews report coming up, (2) exiting a trade in resistance close to target, \nand (3) exiting a trade on account of a reversal development. \nNews Report Exit \nSince the market's response to a major release can be dangerously fick­\nly and is often seen to fully defy the earlier dominant pressures (spikes \nof more than 50 pip are not uncommon), the general recommendation \nis to avoid exposure when such news comes out. Whether this means \nnot trading an hour, a half hour or just a few bars prior to the release is \nnot so easy to point out. Among other things, it could depend on one's \nappetite for risk, the technical picture and the overall activity of the pre­\nnews market, as well as the perceived significance of the report itself. \nVery often the significance of an upcoming report can already be \ngauged by watching the way the market trades up towards the release. \nIf the price action goes flat for several hours on end, this could be an \nindication that big parties are laying low in anticipation of the event; in \nsuch cases, we often see a vicious response the very second the news \ncomes out. \n144 \n",

First there is the weight of the report. Since \nnot all releases tend to cause a hefty response, not all of them need to \nbe feared. Reports and events to always watch out for are: nonfarm \npayroll (NFP), housing and production, job and unemployment, inter­\nest rate decisions, and of course the non-number incidents like central \nbank speeches and the like. The exact time of these releases are often \nscheduled well in advance and can be found on any thorough Econom­\nic Calendar freely available on the web. Not seldom their significance \n(possible impact) is rated on these sites as well.

Since most reports recur on a monthly basis, \nestablishing their significance beforehand will be time well spent. While \nnasty surprises can never be fully prevented, a rather dependable way \nto assess a market's sensitivity is to scroll back through a year of intra­\nday price action, take note of all sudden blasts that are obviously out \nof the ordinary-probably no more than two or three per week in your \ntime zone-and compare them with the tables of the economic calendar \nof that year (take heed also of daylight savings time). Should a certain \nreport have little impact on your particular instrument, there is no real \nreason to shun the event when already in the market, or when aiming \nto take position. \nWhen it comes to the eur / usd, and most other US dollar crosses, the \nbiggest impact on prices can be expected at 14:30 CET-an hour before \nthe US stock markets open-and to a lesser extent at 16:00.

Let's delve into this more deeply by comparing two hypothetical \nopen positions: prior to the release one trade is running, say, 1 5  pip \nin the plus and the other currently 5 pip in the red. Assuming further \n(wrongly) that a very fat news spike would either take out the target or \nthe stop based on the original bracket order settings (20/ 10), we can \nquickly establish that the prospects on both ventures are not exactly \nequal. The profitable trade could make an additional 5 pip in a favor­\nable spike, but could lose 25 pip the other way around (measured from \nits current profitable position). On the non-profitable trade, the situa­\ntion is reversed. Now the venture could lose an extra 5 pip at the most, \nwhereas it stands to rake in 25 pip should prices spike favorably. \nThe above is just one example of comparison.

The main reason is \nthat we can trust neither the market nor the platform to honor our stop \nshould prices spike adversely.

If not, this is referred to as slippage. \nIn relatively normal conditions, slippage on a stop will seldom exceed \na few pipettes (tenths of a pip). Yet on a news spike exit, slippage can \nbe huge. Of course, the true extent of the damage will be a function of \nthe actual spike and the liquidity in it, but the speed with which the \ntrading platform can fill the order may have an effect on the outcome \nas well.

This \nseems a fair approach, but it harbors an aspect of possible concern: if \nmanual intervention is allowed, this could open the door to on-the-fly \ndecision making and all sorts of fear-based exits that may ultimately \ndo more harm than good. Therefore, when adopting discretionary man­\nagement techniques as part of the plan, it is absolutely vital to learn \nto suppress the instinct of flight and to solely exit on chart technical \ngrounds. \nA great way to mitigate the likelihood of an unintended scratch is \nto always determine the resistance exit level prior to taking position. In \nother words, a reduced target objective should be part of the plan from \nthe outset and not stem from a sudden urge to bail out. \nShould we have put on a trade with the standard exit in mind, of \ncourse at some point the position may run into fi wall of resistance not \npresent at the time of entry; when such a sideways cluster gets broken \nadversely, this may call for intervention, too, but it is a different situ­\nation altogether. We will have a look at this in the following section on \nthe reversal exit. \nBefore delving into the technical specifics of the resistance exit, let \nus first agree on a reasonable threshold beyond which this technique \nbecomes applicable. It makes sense to employ a minimum objective in \norder to at least make the wager worth our while. When the 20 pip tar­\nget is standard, how about, say, 14 pip. Of course, any trader can lower \nthis threshold at his own discretion, but I would advice not to go below \n10 pip, so as to at least maintain an acceptable risk/ reward ratio of 1 :  1 \n(when trading with a 10 pip stop). \nThus for now, if the perceived level of obstruction resides at a dis­\ntance that would yield a profit of less than 14 pip-but let's not split \nhairs-we simply skip the trade. \n148 \n",

Why do traders indulge in such destructive \nbehavior? Could it be that their egos are forcing them to do so. For egos \ndo not think in probabilities, they have an agenda fully of their own: to \nprotect the mind from the pain and shame of seeing a once profitable \ntrade turn red. So they bang the exit button. Before caving in, though, \nperhaps these traders should reflect on the following: missing out on \n20 pip profit by scratching a valid trade at break-even is essentially \nsynonymous to being shaken out twice on a 10 pip stop. Surely the \nego should not like that one either. The point here: when considering \nintervention tactics, the aim should be to exit in strength rather than \nweakness. Hence the resistance exit. \nThe second long of this session, taken from the break of a three-bar \ncombi (6-7), is a range variant of a pullback reversal. On this trade, the \nfirst resistance in sight was the ceiling test with the low of bar 5. If not \nyet fully on target there, closing out the trade in bar 8 is a valid call \n(avoids also the pull of the adverse 50-level magnet). \nThe pullback reversal trade above bar 9 (pretty aggressive entry con­\nsidering the 5-8 double top to the left) is a classic intervention candidate. \nBulls may have shown themselves a little more dominant in this ses­\nsion, the market was far from trending yet (note the rather flat 25ema), \nand that always makes it a fair call to anticipate resistance in the highs. \nAs to the exit, the ceiling test with the low of bar 5 was no longer \na \"usable\" option because the touch of bar 8 in that level had already \nmitigated its earlier significance. That basically left either the high of \nbar 8 or the high of bar 5 to serve as an exit trigger. Since the former \nmay not yet have yielded the minimum profit of about 14 pip, the dotted \nline was the level to gun for (scratch the trade in bar 10). \nThe trade below bar 1 1  (pattern break combi short) is another resis­\ntance exit candidate.

A poor break indeed. \nMore interesting was the 6-9 buildup in the middle of the range. \nBulls again had been working their way up from the lows, but this time \nfaced more opposition. These type of cluster progressions always call \nfor attention. In fact, they harbor within them the very principle that \nlies at the base of our operating policy: to see solid buildup-attack and \ndefense-prior to taking position. \nAn interesting variant of the flag formation is the ascending or de­\nscending triangle. In the ascending version, the pattern is capped by a \nhorizontal line across the highs, with ascending lows at the other end. \nProgression 7-8-9, hanging from the pole 6-7, is a good example. \nWith prices thus capped on one side while pushing up at the other, \nthe pressure can only build up. This implies that the ascending triangle \nmight pop on the bull side, as with a regular bull-flag pattern.

In such cases, very important \nis to assess whether the situation is truly ripe for a break, meaning \nthe buildup has to be substantial. Of course, conservative traders can \nalways skip; should they miss the initial breakout, there is still a rea­\nsonable chance to be offered an entry in second instance (pattern break \npullback long above bar 10). \nNote: An optional technique here, but best applied sparingly, is not \nto trade the break of bar 9 straightaway, but to fire long on the break of \nthe pattern line itself, a few pip higher up. A decent marker with which \nto measure this alternative is to check whether a standard stop would \nstill survive a quick retest of the 25ema.

(An alternative tactic here, savvy but \nnot without risk, is to deploy a resistance exit a little above bar 3, in \nanticipation of a false high turnaround.) \nAs stated, even in a ranging market it may not always be necessary \nto exit a trade in resistance. When the buildup prior to entry is of very \nfine quality, prices may very well pop beyond whatever obstruction lies \non the way. As to the buildup within the ascending triangle, this was \nquite fat indeed, and so it may have been decided to simply let the \nbracket handle the trade above bar 9. On the higher entry above bar 10, \nhowever, there was a greater risk for opposition because the high of bar \n3 now needed to be cleared quite a bit to get to target. \nWith multiple options to consider, some supposedly better than oth­\ners, how is a trader to decide on the best course of action? Alas, there \ncan be no easy answer to this question, but always a suitable tactic, in \nany time of doubt, is to embrace the power of common sense.

Even if by some freak \nmiracle the present price action would mirror the exact same features \nof some earlier event, then still there will be other players and other vol­\nume behind it. By this I mean to say that all situations are truly unique \nand the best they can do is resemble one another. In other words, all we \ncan do is form ourselves a reasonable idea on the market's most likely \nanswer. When it comes to manual intervention, two options come to \nmind: action or reaction. The resistance exit is clearly a function of the \nfirst. By grabbing profits in a designated level of perceived resistance, \nwe deliberately take action without waiting for the market's response. \nA good example would be to deploy an exit on the short in the dotted \nline at 14. If we are to defend the reason behind this scratch, we could \nstart by saying that the market was back at the lower region of a range, \nwhich is a danger zone to any short. Furthermore, observation has it \nthat when a double bottom is firmly in place (2-6), prices tend to sooner \nhammer in a higher bottom than a triple bottom. With this in mind, it \nmade sense to pick the ceiling test exit (dotted line) rather than the level \nof the low of bar 6. Looking closely, the low of bar 14 was not only the \n\"ceiling\" (floor) of the 3-6-7 arch, it was also a double bottom with the \nlow of bar 8, which further increased the bounce potential in the area. \nThe second popular management technique is to exit not in proactive \nbut in reactive fashion. Instead of aiming to bail out before the mar­\nket has a chance to turn adversely, this technique awaits the market's \nresponse first and then determines the course of action, based on what­\never shows up. As an example: bears still in position could have exited \nabove bar 16, in response to the faltering follow-through on the break \nbelow the dotted line at 15.

No trader takes pleasure in seeing a profitable trade \nturn bad, and strong can be the urge to protect whatever gains are still \nin place. But the trader be warned. Where improper usage of a resis­\ntance exit may pocket some decent profits still, faulty implementation of \na reversal exit can come with serious regret; not only will there be little \nprofit left, if at all, not seldom the towel is thrown in at the worst pos­\nsible moment: right when prices stand good chance to turn favorably \nagain. Enter the reversal exit trap. \nThat being said, when properly applied, the reversal exit is a fantas­\ntic weapon to wield and can indeed save many a faltering trade from full \nannihilation. How many times have we not seen a sideways develop­\nment build up against our position in a way that the chances of ever \nreaching target appeared minimal at best. \nWhat are the classic characteristics of such adverse development? As \nis the case with all patterns, reversal formations come in many shapes \nand sizes, but they do tend to share some very recognizable features \nthat portray the adverse pressures within. The easiest way to visualize \nthese patterns is to see them as either an M or W -variant. The M-shape, \nfor example, starts out with an upswing (left leg), followed by a middle­\npart (often containing a double-top element) and is then completed by \na downswing (right leg). In such a pattern, it is the break of the middle­\npart section that could trigger a reversal exit. \nWhenever a number of bars start to cluster in a relatively tight span, \nultimately prices can do only one of two things: they either break away \nfrom this buildup to continue the former dominant pressure (think \nflag), or they break out at the other end in an attempt to initiate an M or \nW -pattern reversal. In case of the latter, very important is to assess the \nreversal pressure in its proper light. While it can never be fully prevent­\ned to get tricked out of a trade, not all adverse pressure is created equal. \nLet us visualize a valid exit from the viewpoint of a sell-side wa-\n156 \n",

Comfortably positioned in a profitable short (left leg of the W), with \nprices well on their way to target, a small cluster of bars starts to rebel \nagainst our trade; the bull attacks within this cluster may not pose \nan immediate threat, and all of it may still take place below a falling \n25ema, but the action is worthy of attention if only for the fact that \nprices fail to set new lows. The longer this standoff continues, the fat­\nter the cluster builds up and the bigger the potential impact of a break \neither way. Therefore, if at some point prices fail to break out at the bot­\ntom and instead a bullish powerbar pops up, this is a development not \nlikely to go unnoticed. When this powerbar then gets broken on top by \nanother bar, the market is sending out an even stronger message that \nprices have no intention to drop further anytime soon. This situation \ncould call for a valid exit on the short. \nWhen there is no adverse powerbar involved (or a combi version of it), \nexit tactics are not necessarily off, but there is a stronger chance that \nthe cluster formation is still looked upon as a bear-flag variant, mean­\ning that bear parties may now be less tempted to let go of their shorts, \nnot even on a break of the current middle-part's high. And bulls may be \nless eager to enter on it. Considering the stronger potential for a false \nbreak, deploying a reversal exit may not be the smartest choice. \nAs the name suggests, the reversal exit is mostly a function of a \nprofitable trade turning sour (otherwise there is little to reverse). This \nimplies that in many an instance we may be able to deploy the exit with \nonly minimal damage, or even for a tiny profit still. Or to put it in anoth­\ner way, if the adverse pressure already starts to build up shortly after \nentry, we are not just dealing with a faltering trade but with a faltering \nbreakout, and in most such cases it is probably best to let the bracket \nstop take care of protection. Let's explore some practical examples to get \nan impression of the tactics involved. \n157 \n",

      "text": "Chapter 6 \nManual Exits - Reversal Exit \nAs already repeatedly addressed, the first pullback after a fresh \nbreakout is seldom reason to bail out of a trade. More likely, it forms \nan opportunity for latecomers to take position in line with the original \nbreak (the low at 4 was a technical test with the combi on the left and \nalso a 50 percent correction of the breakout swing 2-3). \nSo, initially, pullback 3-4 can be regarded as a bull-flag, which is a \ncontinuation pattern; prices indeed managed to break out topside, but \nthat's about as far as it went. Instead of clearing the former high of 3, \nbar 5 suddenly took a nosedive from which it could not recoup before \nits close. Was this a sign to prepare for a reversal exit? \nLooking closely, we can see that bar 5 not only put in a double top \nwith bar 3 (lower top to be exact), it was a mean false high with its neigh­\nbor and it single-handedly completed the right side of the M-pattern's \nmiddle-part. There were only six bars involved in this cluster (3-5), but \nin relation to its modest pole 2-3 this was quite a telling pattern. Since \nwe aim to exit on a break, we can grant the market one last chance to \nshape up; but the very moment bar 5 is taken out, all hopes should be \ncast aside and our trade is best exited without further thought. \nNote that when bar 5 was broken, the actual low of the middle-part \nwas not (4). To some this may have been reason to stay in the trade still, \nbut in most cases I would advice not to resort to such optimism and to \nsimply accept the message of the broken powerbar. \nNote: To determine the degree of danger within adverse buildup, the \nharmony principle may help out once again. Just like we should avoid \nto trade a continuation break of a non-harmonious flag (in relation to \nits pole), so should we avoid to exit on a reversal break of a rather feeble \nmiddle-part (in relation to the left leg before it). What may help to assess \nthe \"ripeness\" of this middle-part section is to see if we can already visu­\nalize the full pattern's completion in symmetrical fashion. For example, \nwith double-top progression 3-5 hanging rather harmoniously from the \nleft leg 2-3, it wasn't very hard to imagine this pattern to be completed \nby a right leg that would more or less copy the swing of the left leg (5-6 \nmimics 2-3). Do recall, though, that the actual completion of the right \nleg is basically irrelevant, since the plan is to already deploy the exit on \nthe break of the middle-part.

This showed bullish resilience \nand may have given rise to the impression that the market was about \nready for another move up. And since the 6-7 cluster hung sideways \nfrom its pole 5-6, this harbored characteristics of a pending W -reversal. \nGranted, this middle-part lacked the harmonious features of the situa­\ntion on the left, but at least the break of bar 7 was in line with the earlier \ndominant pressure (think pullback reversal). With this in mind, should \nwe have re-entered on the bull side again, on the break of bar 7? \nBefore accepting any wager, it is important to assess what exactly \nprices have to do in order to reach target. Here they would have had \nto eat themselves a path through the double-top cluster overhead, and \nfight out this battle in a major round number level to boot. Had progres­\nsion 6-7 shown up at the end of a first correction, the break of bar 7 \nmay have had a lot more merit. But now that the market had corrected \nnot once but twice (M-pattern double top), the prospects for a substan­\ntial breakout were far less promising. \nHere is another way to look at it: for any trade to succeed, we need \nassistance from sideline companions; if there was already little enthu­\nsiasm to take prices beyond the round number when the path was \nrelatively free earlier on, what are the odds that new bulls would want \nto help out with now an M-pattern block spoiling the view.

To determine this with neutral eyes, we have \nto fully ignore the bearish panic move that followed, for this may have \nbeen a reaction to a US news report that favored the dollar (16:00 CET). \nThe technical question of relevance here is whether the adverse combi \n9-10 was to be regarded as part of a relatively harmless pullback, or a \nharbinger of more trouble ahead and thus a legitimate reason to exit \nbelow. \nApart from the fact that the upcoming news report may already have \nbeen reason to exit the long, or not to have entered on it in the first \nplace (see News Report Exit earlier in this chapter), there is another way \nto address this issue and that is to find out if we can detect within the \npost-breakout action any signs of an M-pattern reversal formation. \nThere are only three bars outside the broken pattern line but if we \ntrack them closely, bar by bar, we can see that they indeed make up an \nM-formation variant.

Although hardly a guarantee for a \nsuccessful outcome, such bounce potential is always a welcome asset \nin the total concept of a trade (a bounce could also facilitate a reversal \nexit later on). \nIf we compare this entry setting with the break above bar 2, we can \nsee that on our earlier trade the round number was not nearly as fa­\nvorably positioned, as a consequence of our entry being a number of \npip above it. Insignificant as these differences may appear on the price \naxis, they can make all the difference when working with tight stops. \nPut in another way: in questionable situations as shown above (regard­\ning continuation), entry conditions of excellent standing may at times \ntip the balance in favor of participation. But do be mindful not to resort \nto these tactics when the session's overall pressure speaks unfavorably \nof the event. And needless to mention also, conservative traders can \nalways skip any offer that does not meet their standard of indisputable \nvalidity. \nIn our next chapter, we will have a closer look at the often subtle \nyet crucial differences between favorable and unfavorable conditions. \nBut before going there, let us take up one last example of reversal exit \ntechnique. \n171 \n",

The break of the latter tends to have \nless of a bite, and is thus more prone to result in a shake (reversal exit \ntrap). \nEven though bar S wasn't taken out in this chart, an exit below it \nmay have been premature for another reason also: the market was in \nvery bullish mode and had just broken away from a fine bull-flag (2 -3 \nhanging from 1-2). In such an environment, it is fair to anticipate that \nnot too many bulls would immediately chicken out of their longs when \npresented with a relatively minor reversal bar break. \nFair enough. But what if there are two evening-stars in a row.

A pretty easy scratch, at \nnext to no damage. \nThis leaves us to evaluate the break of the rectangle pattern. The \nreader is prompted to take note of a rather common mistake, quite re­\nsilient among traders, but essentially not too hard to avoid. It regards \nthe distinction between a reversal pattern for exiting purposes and one \non which break to take position. \nNeutrally regarded, the four-hour range within the box had all the \nmakings of a reversal formation. If we track the bars from left to right, \nwe could look upon the total progression as an elongated M-pattern, or \nmaybe a flattened version of the head-and-shoulders formation. Thus, \nwe cannot blame a bull for exiting his long on the break of bar 8. But \na bear would have done well here to at least think twice about shorting \nthe event. \nHow could the break of such a fine barrier get a bear in trouble? If \nwe solely concentrate on the box progression, shorting below bar 8 does \nnot look so bad. But if we take into account the bull rally from which \nthe box was hanging, it is not hard to grasp why the sell-side potential \nwas limited. For several hours the bullish pressure may have lain dor­\nmant, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the chart was still in \nbullish mode. In such a session, basically any lower level could trigger \na new round of buying, even below a broken range. This is not to say \nthat a nimble scalper would not be able to steal some pip in the initial \nbreakout, but those who aim for more are well advised to at least moni­\ntor their positions with a sharp eye on the post-breakout action. \nNot serving the bearish cause either was the 50-level running directly \nunderfoot. And not much below it there waited another level of potential \nsupport: a 50 percent retracement of the UK morning bull rally. All told, \nthe overall conditions were unsupportive of a serious break, which is \nwhy the short below bar 8 was of dubious quality at best. But now that \nwe're at it, let us look at the options on how to have handled a situation \nlike this if caught in it anyway. \nInitially, the break met with nice follow-through.

Perhaps a bear in \nposition may have argued that prices stood good chance to bounce back \nfrom the box barrier extension, as in many a post-breakout situation \n(think pattern break pullback setup). But before such reasoning is ap­\nplied, it would be wise not to lose track of the way the correction to the \nbroken barrier is built up. \nNote: To distinguish between a \"harmless\" pullback and its more \npoisonous counterpart, chart conditions may already put in their bit, \nbut very often the nature of the correction itself provides all the infor­\nmation needed.

This is when a particular breakout shows all the \ncharacteristics of a tradable event (boundary, buildup, signal bar, etc), \nif not for the fact that it clearly goes up against the dominant pressure. \nShould the trap indeed fall shut on those who accept, this could set up \na counterbreak in line with dominance. \nUnderstandably, not all false breakouts automatically qualify to be \ntraded in the opposite direction, which is why we need to establish a \ngood view on the requirements involved. But those that do pass the test \nmay very well be among the most potent of trade setups when it comes \nto generating immediate follow-through. Should we take position on \nsuch a counterbreak event, we can refer to this as trading a break for \nfailure. \nHow is this different from our other ventures? The main difference \nlies within the contrarian touch. On a regular pattern break trade, for \nexample, the pre-breakout tension at the pattern boundary builds up \ntowards a breakout in line with the dominant pressure; on these type of \nwagers there is no contrarian element involved. When we trade a break \nfor failure, on the other hand, the initial buildup is directed towards \nwhat we perceive to be the nonfavorable side of the market. Now the \nidea is not to trade the break from this buildup progression, but to an­\nticipate and trade the failure of it.

In a \nbear break situation, special attention should go out to a bullish turn­\naround bar; the first to come along could already set up the re-break \nentry (5). \nOf critical importance, though, is the high of this turnaround bar. \nSince we are looking to trade the break below the dotted barrier for \nfailure, we have to make sure that our entry is back above it (failure \nconfirmation).

For starters, trading for continuation in the \nhighs of a bull rally on such a shallow correction cannot be regarded as \na high-odds play. And the entry was offered far away from the 25ema. \nPlus there was the issue of the broken 50-level magnet. \nThis brings us to the third reversal block of the session, the 1 1-13 \nsituation.

The bear-flag at 08:00 is a good example: a failed reversal \nthat played out in favor of bearish continuation. In the later stages of \na rally, the contrarian prospects naturally improve. Especially when a \nsideways cluster shows up at quite some distance from the trending \n25ema (as was the case with the box), and then gets broken towards it, \ncontrarian parties stand to benefit from a very powerful ally: the magnet \nof the 25ema. \nWhen not in position, all this is just information; we would neither \nuse such a box for shorting purposes, nor go long above it.

But before doing so ourselves, let us not forget \nto check the conditions first. As discussed in Chapter 5, an important \naspect in pullback reversal technique is to see a correction of interest \ntravel diagonally and orderly against the dominant swing, with little \nsigns of aggression within.

Hence the skips below \nbar 12 and 13; both signal bars were of poor quality anyway. \nBut even without the box attached, the near-vertical correction of \nthe 10- 1 1  swing was way too aggressive in appearance to even consider \nshorting against it. \nWhile there is usually little need for the power of foresight to an­\nticipate a modest box reversal in the lows or highs of a session, it is \nabsolutely impossible to foretell these full-fledged turnarounds as de­\npicted in the chart above ( 10- 15).

Remember, when a trend is followed by a trend \nin the other direction, the market is essentially traveling in a range and \nthis is generally not the best climate to play for substantial continua­\ntion.

(To better il­\nlustrate its blocky features, the low of 2 was excluded from the box.) \nEven though this pattern showed up bearishly below a downtrending \n25ema, within it there were quite a few bars that had managed to close \nwell away from their lows. Was the market bracing itself for a bullish \nreversal? \nIn all fairness, when such a reversal block shows up as part of a first \ndecent correction in a newly established trend, the chances for a sub­\nstantial break against the dominant pressure are usually not that good. \nBut this may not stop parties from trying, though. \nBefore things turned sour on them, bulls will have liked the way \ntheir box break came about.

With the market still in bearish mode, why is the pull­\nback reversal below bar 6 annotated as a skip? \nSeveral reasons come to mind. First off, the pullback, though decent \nin height, showed only one reversal bar in its top (6). While it is not \nuncommon for prices break away from a single turnaround bar in the \naverage, the most reliable reversals tend to stem from a bit more pulling \nand pushing in the turn, especially when the pullback in question is not \nthe first to defy the trend. \nBut there were more warning signs to consider. For example, had \nwe run a pattern line beneath the lows of this pullback, it would not \nhave been broken yet at the break of bar 6. Also, there was an adverse \nmagnet on the lurk: the ceiling test with the low of bar 4 from where \nthe earlier trade-for-failure break had taken off (not a major drawback, \nbut potent enough to take into account). And lastly, in creating the 5-6 \ncorrection, bulls had broken back through the OO-level with apowerbar \nthat had sprung from a little box progression; all very good reasons to \nbe highly cautious on the sell side. \nAs it turned out, the market never even bothered to put in a test \nwith that box; instead, bulls set out to establish a massive bull run that \nwould completely destroy the earlier bearish dominance (5-8). \nAs taken up in previous discussions, a counterrally that fully defies \nthe earlier dominant pressure is best not seen as a new trend.

At the \nother side of the pattern, a double bottom is likely to show (5-7), but \nthe exact features here are not so relevant since we do not anticipate a \nbreak at this end. While the big W -element already hints at the market's \nbullish intentions, a mere break of the middle-part section may not be \nthe place to hop on board with a tight stop. As always, for participa­\ntion to be granted, we need to see some buildup first. This is where the \nsmaller w comes in. \nIf we track the up/down motion of the 8-9-T-1O progression, we can \nsee some bullish and bearish bars switching position, as in a regular \nsqueeze. Very common also in this kind of buildup is a failed first break­\nout, generally referred to as a tease (T). \nIn any pattern break situation there are essentially two ways for a \ntease break scenario to set up. Either the breakout originates from a \nlevel \"too deep\" within the pattern, or the event does take place from \na squeeze situation at the barrier, but the buildup appears too thin to \nmeet the requirements of proper tension. The former situation is ad­\ndressed in Chapter 2 in the section on \"False Breaks, Tease Breaks and \nProper Breaks\"; along the way, we have already seen a number of such \nexamples, the majority of which not too hard to dodge. Thin buildup, \non the other hand, may cause a little more confusion, because the price \naction does show tension prior to the breakout but too little of it. But \nwhat is enough and what is too little? \nTo answer this in regard to a Ww-pattern, let us briefly recall the \nconcept of harmony within the flag and flagpole relation. In some exam­\nples on the topic, we came to appreciate the guiding hand of proportion, \nwhether it was to warrant action on a break, or to postpone it. Similar \nforces are often at work within the Ww-pattern (as in its Mm-counter­\npart). In a simplified way, we could say that the small w is essentially a \nflag hanging from big Ws right leg. Therefore, the Ww-breakout is best \nacted on when both elements (W and w) relate proportionally to one an­\nother. For example, if the vertical span of a big W is relatively wide, the \nsmaller w should not be too compressed either. That would look rather \n\"non-harmonious\" and may not provide sufficient tension for prices to \npop. Should the big W be rather stretched out, horizontally, then the \n201 \n",

While we \nmay entertain some preference for one situation more than another (for \nexample to see at least four bars in a squeeze), we better not limit our­\nselves with strict rules on these matters. \nIf the break at T was premature, then how about the break above bar \n10? With now two bars added (T -10), the small w had definitely fattened \nup. Furthermore, before turning bullishly around, bar 10 had briefly \nbroken below bar T, which had left a false low on the chart (showing \nbullish persistence). And it was a higher low within the Ww-box. Con­\nsidering also the ideal magnet of the 50-level above, just begging to be \ntargeted, it really would have been a waste not to take our chances on \nthe break of bar 10. \nGranted, it is not always easy to tell a valid break from a tease break \ntrap. At times the line between them can be very thin indeed. Nonethe­\nless, I am absolutely positive that you can train your eye to at least \nrecognize the breakouts of poor quality; from that pleasant base, your \nfeel for harmony and proportion can only progress over time. \nNot long after reaching the 50-level magnet, the Asian market slid \ninto a slow but steady decline. The bottom barrier here may initially \nhave been drawn to connect the lows of 5 and 7 with the lows of 2 and \n3, but after the 13-15 element showed up, it makes sense to have plot­\nted the line as depicted. \nJust like the Ww-box had set up the bull break earlier on, so did \nprogression 13-15 attempt to build up to a bear break.

This formed higher lows along \nthe way and ultimately provided a base for higher prices away from sup­\nport. The pre-breakout tension of 13-15, on the other hand, showed up \nunfavorably in the lows of a range. As we know, when buildup is absent \nor lacking in substance, this seldom sets up favorably for continuation. \nThere may have been some stalling on the pattern line from 13 to 15, \nbut in terms of buildup it all looked a bit feeble; and the 25ema wasn't \nexactly helping out either (no squeeze whatsoever). In other words, the \nbear break in bar 15 enjoyed little technical backup, yet it had to over­\ncome strong support of multiple lows on the left (2, 3, 5 and 7, take your \npick). Not surprisingly, few parties were prepared to commit themselves \non the sell side here; and it didn't take long for contrarian bulls to pick \nup 6n this reluctance. \nA failed breakout on one side of buildup often sets the stage for a \ncounterbreak at the other end; and not seldom this one comes with \nbetter credentials attached. In fact, with combi 16 added, the 12-13- 14-\n15-16 progression now bore all the features of a W-pattern ready to be \ncompleted. \nConsidering the bullish implications, we cannot blame a bear for \nbailing out on his short on the break of combi 16 (reversal exit). An even \nstronger warning was sent out when bar 17 was broken on top, for this \nwas now a three-bar combi breakout, and it coincided with a pattern \nline perforation to boot. \nSo why not trade long on the break of bar 17? Technically regarded, \nthis was not an offer of the most unsavory kind; but we cannot say the \nconditions were of such favorable nature to look upon this wager as a \nhigh-odds proposition. Here's another way to look at it: earlier on, we \nsaw little problem in declining the break in bar T, although the environ­\nment already spoke in favor of the bull side; why then risk capital on a \ntrade with arguably less buildup beneath it and facing more overhead \nresistance as well (the 1 1- 12 cluster). \n203 \n",

And even when the action builds up to a point of \ninterest, nine times out of ten we should be able to assess the situation \nin the blink of an eye still. \nLet's put this to the test. If we imagine to have switched on our trad­\ning platform at, say, 10:00, what could we have derived, in just a few \nseconds of evaluation, from the hints and clues presented? 1: A decent \nbear swing from 08:00 to 09:00 had put the market in bearish mode. \n2: From 09:00 to 10:00, bulls had found footing in the round number \nlevel, which had stalled the bearish momentum in a sideways pattern \nthat now came to attack the trending 25ema. 3: It will have taken us no \nmore than a few seconds also to wrap a box around this action and to \nrecognize the setup as a bull break trap. \nIt is safe to suggest that these observations could have been made \nwith minimal effort in the opening seconds of the bar that followed the \ncombi at 4, so even before the bull break had fully materialized. And it \nwill have taken no longer than the forming of bar 5 itself to have under­\nstood the bearish implications should this bar be broken at the bottom. \nIn fact, bar 5 was a textbook trade-for-failure setup (enter short below it). \n204 \n1 .335 \n1 .33 \n",

These were elements that all bore technical meaning, but \nsince they represented the smaller parts of a bigger total (box), a quick \nassessment of their sum more than sufficed. \nVery helpful also in the analysis process is to simply tap into your \nmental database of price technical patterns and see if you can match \nthe current action with a variant of a pattern that you have seen fail or \nsucceed many times before. For example, compare the bull trap above \ncombi 4 with the one discussed in Figure 7.6 (above 3), or with the one \nin the next chart, Figure 7.9 (above 3). Indeed, these poisonous break­\nouts are far from unique and they show us most evidently that lessons \ncan be learned from the past. To see a bullish version, check Figure 7. 1 \nagain and the way we handled the bear break below the first dotted line \n(longing it for failure above bar 5). \nSoon after the bull break had fallen through, the bearish pressure \npicked up its earlier pace.

But how exactly do \nwe rate the failure potential when the trend is already well on its way? \nSurely, at some point, the market will attempt to turn with better odds \nattached, and maybe this could set up a reversal trade worthy of ac­\nceptance. \nHere's a little rule of thumb that may prove a very handy filter in \nthe vast majority of trending sessions: for as long as the 25ema is still \n205 \n",

If we translate this to the buildup situation between \n12:00 and 13:40, there should have been no discomfort in declining the \nbull-side breaks offered, simply because the 25ema was still sloping \ndown. (Note: In a breakout situation that stems from a lengthy pull­\nback, like an angular flag progression, it is not unthinkable to take \nposition against the current slope of the 25ema, because the extent of \nthe correction may have tilted the average the other way; but this is \nquite different from trading breaks against a trending average.) \nWith bulls and bears keeping each other in check throughout the \nlunch-hour doldrums (12:00- 14:00), the activity within the second box \nslowly took on the shape of a W-pattern middle-part. The top barrier is \ndrawn across the highs of the lowest block, but it could also have been \nplotted a few pip higher up, across the series of highs at the level of 10. \nThis was another good reason to be cautious regarding the buy side, \nfor a debatable pattern barrier is likely to keep consensus on its break \ndivided, and that never sits too well with follow-through. \nAlthough rather compressed vertically, the price action within the \nsecond box did show signs of bullish determination; in it there were \nfalse lows, higher lows and even a three-bar combi right underneath the \ntop barrier ( 1 1- 12). Nonetheless, both the box break entry above combi \n12 and the pattern break pullback offer above bar 14 were easy skips, \nif only for the 25ema \"rule\".

For example, the break below bar 13, \nthe first bearish bar to challenge the box breakout, failed to meet the re­\nquirements of a valid short.

If position was \naccepted, a reversal exit below bar 7 will have kept the damage to a \nmmnnum. \nWhile a bull may have justifiably exited below bar 7, a bear would \nhave done well to lay low on the offer. This is not to say that the bearish \npressure was weak, but the conditions did not allow for a substantial \nbreak on the sell side yet; the chart still showed higher lows on the \nwhole and there was the potential obstruction of the big round number \nto consider as welL \nPrices did sink through the number a bit, and they even fell below \nthe low of the nearest turnaround (combi at 4); but the more prominent \nlow of the morning-star on the left held up well (1-2), which will surely \nhave helped to keep the prospects of re-conquering the round number \nalive for the bulls. \nIn bar 8, prices broke out of what can be regarded as a W-pattern \n214 \n",

A few bars later, a pat­\ntern break pullback entry was offered above bar 9, but this break, too, \ncould not yet boast of a top-quality label. Just look at that wall of resis­\ntance within the 5-6-7 cluster, still very much in view. \nBulls did emerge victoriously from the round number skirmish, but \nthey had no easy time plowing through the bearish opposition. \nIn the absence of matching highs, it was only when bar 10 had \nbounced away from the high of bar 5 that the range barrier could have \nbeen drawn as depicted. It wasn't a very distinctive boundary by any \nmeans, but good enough to plot and extend for futures purposes. It \ncould always be adjusted later on. \nWith prices caught between the box barrier and the 25ema, progres­\nsion 1 1- 12 bore elements of a squeeze, but it wasn't very tight. For this \nreason, we can look upon the initial perforation of the barrier as a tease \nbreak candidate, in essence a premature break (T). \nPrices indeed were forced to retreat from the tease, but it was a slow­\ngoing affair with no signs of aggression on the part of the bears. This \nultimately formed the 13- 14 bull-flag, which was well supported by the \n10-12 cluster on the left (technical test). Note that throughout this cor­\nrection, the trending average hadn't even flinched. Quite the contrary, it \nhelpfully guided the bars back out of the box. \nThe flag break setup at 14 was a reversed combi variant in which the \nbullish powerbar came second to the inside bar; it was also a textbook \nmorning-star pattern, if we include the bearish bar before it (compare \nwith progression 1-2). \nWith the bulk of obstruction now out of the way, the 50-level mag­\nnet, about 25 pip out, stood to reel prices in from the moment of entry. \nBeyond question, this was a pattern breakout (range and flag) of the \nhigh-odds category, and well worth the wait. \n215 \n",

Ironically, the bull spike not much \nlater provided the pole for a bear-flag formation whose break below bar \n5 sent the market flying the other way around (pole-flag-swing). In the \nDO-level below, another bear-flag set up (6-7), but the break of it failed \nto follow through. As is often seen, the flag formation then took on the \nblocky features of a W-pattern middle-part (6-8), which soon served as \na stepping stone for a rather impressive bullish comeback. \nPoints of interest: Although no setup was provided, there were good \nreasons for declining any long in the area of bar 3: the bull spike had \nstarted from a bear low at 1 (no buildup), had penetrated the round \nnumber on the way up, and was most likely a news driven event (ques­\ntionable dominance); and not unimportant either, the 2-3 correction \nhad shown too much aggression to set up a valid turn. \nConservative traders can ignore the bear-flag setup at 5 also (flag \nbarrier somewhat arbitrarily drawn), but this situation does offer an \ninteresting example of how one extra bar of buildup can sometimes \nswing the pendulum from skipping to accepting a break. Initially, bears \nhad judged combi 4 as too weak a setup for shorting purposes (no fol­\nlow-through on its break); but when bar 5 was added, this now set up \na three-bar combi with better odds attached (showing bearish persis­\ntence). \nAs prices violently broke down, it was only when the collapse had \nequaled the span of the bull spike (5-6 mirrors 1-2) that the bearish \n216 \n",

As the first brave bulls returned on the scene, \nand savvy bears quickly cashed in on their windfall profits (temporary \ndouble pressure on the buy side), another bear-flag formed (6-7), but it \nwas a poisonous pattern to be traded for continuation. Of course, with \nthe break below bar 7 far removed from the 25ema, and with the round \nnumber here working as an adverse magnet, this was a very easy skip \nfrom where we stand. \nWhen powerbar 8 flipped the flag break around, setting up the W­\nmiddle-part as mentioned, the climate was still very bearish. Moreover, \neven if the bulls would manage to position themselves firmly on top of \nthe 25ema again, then still the market would be ranging rather than \ntrending. As we know, this always calls for caution. \nThe otherwise attractive long above combi 9 is best declined. Maybe \na nimble scalper may have taken a shot at gathering a handful of pip \non the way up to the technical test with the low of combi 5 (a likely \nmagnet), but the overall environment clearly lacked a dominant party \nand that generally rules out 20 pip targets. Also, should prices have \nstalled on that upside break, we can imagine the bears to have had little \ntrouble testing back the 1.31 round number. \nAs it turned out, bulls remained persistent and they even traded a \nbearish mini-break at 10 for failure. And within the hour, they pulled \na similar trick by trading the box break for failure as well, above bar \n1 1 . In a trending market, the latter offer may have been a reasonable \noption to pursue, but with prices traveling in a range, and in the tricky \n50-level area to boot, not to mention the technical resistance of the flag \non the left (1-5), trading the break above bar 1 1  cannot be regarded as \na high-odds play. \nAt the end of the UK session (which is the start of the US lunch-hour \ndoldrums), the break of bar 12 was a definite skip for three reasons at \nleast: (a) the bear break of the final box had not been proven false; (b) \nprices resided in the danger zone of the range's highs, and (c) the bull \nentry suffered high risk of the 50-level adverse magnet.

So in strict technical terms, that did not qualify as \na textbook trade-for-failure wager either. \nEven without the benefit of hindsight, we can safely state that the \nthird arrow depicts the superior break, for this offered an entry above \nthe reversal barrier extension.

This situation serves well to highlight a most crucial \nconcept: where the break of a reversal pattern against dominance is \ngenerally met with suspicion, the break of such a pattern in line with it \n(in the turn of a pullback) is very often acted on with little in the way of \nreservation, even when of lesser prowess. \nNote: When there is a strong potential for immediate continuation, \nalternative entry tactics can be considered. For instance, a bull could \nhave decided to overrule standard procedure by firing long not on the \nbreak of signal bar 4, but on the first re-break of the reversal barrier \nextension, should this be offered before a standard entry came to pass. \nWhether or not to go this route is always a personal call. WWen straying \nfrom the regular path, definitely preferable is to have one special condi­\ntion on your side: a quick retest of the 25ema after entry (very common) \nshould not shake out the trade. \nThe subsequent break above bar 7 was still very much in line with \nthe trend, but the offer lacked the ideal features of a high-odds pullback \nreversal. The signal bar was a one-bar turnaround on a second pull­\nback (not necessarily a major deal-breaker), and not far above it there \nresided some blocky resistance within the 5-6 progression. Consider­\ning the bullish climate, this offer was not entirely devoid of appeal, but \nprobably an easy skip to the more conservatively inclined. \nPrices found their way up again and not much later even built up \ntowards another bull break (8). Note: A continuation breakout in the \nhighs or lows of the market, particularly near the close of the US session \n(or in lunch-hour doldrums), can be a very tricky proposition, for such \nevent often lacks the volume necessary to force a substantial break. And \ncontrarians may counter more aggressively as well. \nThis is not to suggest that these breakouts are best traded for failure, \nas was boldly done below bar 9; but as soon as the first signs of trouble \ncome forth, it is certainly no rarity to see a sharp bout of profit taking \nfor the night (9- 10). \n2/9 \n",

When aiming to trade for failure, this usu­\nally means that we should wait for the market to \"edge off' most of \nthe compactness of the obstruction first. Always welcome is to see the \nblocky features of a reversal pattern transform into the angular charac­\nteristics of a continuation pattern, as in a bull or bear-flag formation. \nThis is essentially what happened when the 9- 12 progression was add­\ned to the right of the reversal pattern. \nNotice how the low of bar 10 matched the low of combi 9. This set \nup a double-bottom element in the trending average and was about to \nconfirm a false break with the low of bar 3. (Imagine a horizontal barrier \nfrom the low of 3 extended to the right.) \nI \nIn the meantime, the angular flag line could have been plotted as de­\npicted and its slope lined up perfectly with the three-bar combi 1O- 1 l .  \nThe chart couldn't have offered a better view on the sweetspot at hand. \nOf course, above this flag line there was still the overhead resistance of \nthe M-pattern to consider (it doesn't just evaporate), but with the right \nside of it now more angular shaped, the obstructive potential was no \nlonger that extensive. \nIf the pattern break entry above bar 1 1  was deemed a little too aggres­\nsive still, bulls were offered a second instance entry just a few minutes \nlater, on the break of bar 12. The entry on this break may have been a \nfew pip higher up, but that hardly mitigated the attraction of the setup: \nthe bullish close of signal bar 12 confirmed the flag breakout, and the \nentry above it could boast of triple support of the flag line, the 25ema \nand the round number (no adverse magnets).

Perhaps the prospect of trapped bears running for cover \nmay have allowed for a quick scalp, the overall conditions were not yet \nsupportive enough to shoot for anything substantial. \nIf not-done so already, a range box may have been plotted as depicted \nwhen the market came to attack the former highs of 1 and 2. Note the \nclassic false break trap when prices peeked through this barrier by a \nmere one or two pip (F). But a bear, too, can get hurt in that very same \nbreak, should he have placed a protective stop just outside of the range. \nAs contrarians laid low for the moment, this formed a flag progres­\nsion underneath the range barrier (F- l 1), but way too weak and poorly \npositioned to trade for continuation (skip the break of bar 1 1). \nBulls who took a shot at the flag break soon had to pay dearly for \ntheir efforts (12- 13).

Apart \nfrom the fact that the market wasn't trending bearishly enough to war­\nrant such aggression, the break of the box had not yet been proven false \nat that point. \nThe false low at 9 depicts a fine example of contrarian response to a \npoor bear break below a round number. \nThe break below bar 10 was an easy skip also. Not only was this sig­\nnal bar quite tall in comparison with the surrounding activity (likely to \nprovoke a counterstrike), the entry below it was offered right in the lows \nof the market, with both the 50-level and the 25ema pulling adversely. \nThe next break was a tncky one: now prices had broken away from \na three-bar combi (10- 1 1), but the situation in the 50-level still looked \na bit fishy. True, bears had shown themselves the stronger party on the \nwhole, but we cannot say the bullish defense in the lows was broken \nin a very distinctive fashion. Again a personal call, hence the optional \nmark. \nPullback 13-14 was calm and orderly, in relation to the bear rally, \nbut had emerged from a blocky cluster ( 12- 13). That technically invali­\ndated the short below bar 14; the second break, below bar 15, showed \nprove of bearish persistence, but did not set up as a conservative wager \neither (danger of contrarian opposition in support of the 12- 13 block). \nTricky also was the pending US Open at 15:30. \n227 \n",

In a newly established \ntrend, the first retracement to the 25ema is always worthy of attention \n(pullback reversal candidate). \nPoints of interest: Whenever prices travel from one round number \nto the next relatively uncontested (1-3), a pullback reversal setup half­\nway these two levels comes with an added bonus: a favorable magnet. \nBut before stepping in on the turn too eagerly, let us not forget to gauge \nthe features of the pullback first. Remember, we do not want to see too \nmuch aggression displayed within the retracement, nor elements of the \nblocky kind. \nIn regard to the latter, I wrapped a small box around the lows of the \nfirst pullback to capture the clustering motion of a little round number \nskirmish. As we can see, this pullback started out somewhat blocky, \nwhich could pose a problem for prices on the way back from the turn \nlater on. But then again, if we follow the 3-5 correction up to its break­\ning point, it is hard to dismiss the many signs that spoke in favor of \nbearish follow-through. \nFirst off, a very decent pattern line had guided prices on the way \nup (no debate on its perforation). Second, bar 5 had put in a welcome \ntechnical test with the little hiccup in the earlier downtrend (high of 5 \ntests low of 2). Third, the correction was a 50 percent retracement of \nthe \\tominant bear swing and the first to defy it. Fourth, an evening­\nstar variant in the top set up the short (4-5-6).

And \nlastly, there was the 50-level magnet waiting below. All in all, it is fair to \nsuggest that these bearish elements sufficiently offset the potential for \nobstruction within the little box progression. \nBulls may have done their best to extend the correction for as long \nas possible, but once the break below bar 6 was set, the bearish domi­\nnance quickly reemerged. As prices hit the 50-level, a resistance exit \nmay have been an option, but strictly seen, there was no reason to in­\ntervene since the market was in trending mode. \nSubsequent pullbacks to the 25ema can reverse equally well as can \ntheir primary counterparts, but on the whole, they are trickier to play. \nFor example, if we compare the offer below bar 6 with the one below \nbar 7, it doesn't take much technical savvy to regard the latter of lesser \nquality. Not only stood the 50-level to meddle with the trade, prices had \nto dig through the cluster of the second box, whose earlier upside break \nhad not been proven false at that point (visualize the extension of the \nbox's top barrier). \nContrarian bulls chose the bear break in bar 8 to initiate a counter \nplay, which appeared successful at first, but soon faced the triple de­\nfense of the round number, the 25ema and the angular pattern line's \nextension.

The main reason is found in the start­\ning point of the flagpole. Swinging aggressively up from well below the \n25ema, this bullish charge clearly was in disrespect of the foregoing \npressure (bull swing starting from a bear low). This doesn't take away \nfrom the bullish feat itself, but it does tend to compromise the continu­\nation prospects. Even if the 3-4 bull-flag had set up in a better technical \nfashion, that would hardly have improved the odds for follow-through \non its break. \nPoor odds on a break in one direction do not necessarily imply high \nodds on a break in the other. Trading breaks for failure is a practice best \napplied in trending conditions with the overall consensus visibly lined \nup in favor of the trade.

On top of that, the entry above \nbar 8 was vulnerable to the pull of the 50-level magnet below it. Not \nmuch later, the 9-10 pullback invited similar concerns. Just skip these \nweak offers. \nAlthough the market was essentially in ranging mode, bulls were in \ncontrol throughout, buying every higher low in sight; but we cannot say \nthey built up well towards their breaks.

With this skirmish taking place below a pattern line \nas well, things certainly didn't look up. Technically this set up a great \nshort, but there is a little catch: to get to target, prices had to go up \nagainst the earlier bull swing 1-3. Since this rally was the most notable \nswing in the chart so far, plenty of bulls may still have been lying in wait \nfor a 50 percent correction. For this reason, the short below bar 8 quali­\nfies as a resistance exit candidate. An option here could be to cash in \nas soon as bar 9 hit upon the highs of the hiccup at 2, or thereabouts, \na little shy of 20 pip. \nIt took bull parties about forty minutes to create a very interesting \nreversal pattern from which to launch another upside attack: the Ww­\nvariant in the box around 13:00. \nThe break above bar 10 set up from below a falling 25ema, but this \nwas more a consequence of the substantial pullback rather than bear­\nish pressure on the whole. Certainly a pleasant bonus here was the \nfavorable round number magnet about 25 pip out. \nThe 10-12 bull swing marched straight through former highs, but \nas soon as its momentum Petered out, bears simply continued their fa­\nvorite practice of the day: trapping bulls above the round number.

Therefore, the offer below combi 13 is best accepted with a \nresistance exit in mind (14). \nNot much later, progression 14-15 sent out a pretty strong hint that \nbulls were planning yet another round number attack (small W-pattern \nmiddle-part following the US Open at 15:30).

Those who traded long above bar 5 with a protective stop below \nthat same bar may have miraculously survived the immediate contrar­\nian charge, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they took great \nrisk on entry.

Once this bull swing was put in, with \nnot a bear in sight, all the market did, or could do, was range between \nthe high and the halfway mark of it. \nPoints of interest: Even well before anything tradable shows up, \nwe can usually form ourselves a pretty good idea on the themes of the \nupcoming battles. For example, we have witnessed time and time again \nthat when a round number gets broken without any sign of protest, it \nwill remain a strong magnet for as long as it hasn't been tested back. \nAnother thing we can almost be sure of is that when a pullback comes to \nchallenge a trending move, plenty of parties will aim to pick up position \naround the halfway mark. We also have seen many a double-pressure \npop originate from a solidly built up pullback reversal. Of course, count­\nless participants will have observed similar tendencies, and their focus, \nlike ours, will be on anticipating these events as well. This is essentially \nwhat creates the climate for the abundant repetitive ways of the market. \nAll this \"knowledge\" is nice, of course, but it is crucial not to let any \nof it lead to feelings of bias or premature acting. Sure, a pullback will \nprobably come to visit the magnet and chances are the subsequent turn \nwill be bought; but we have no way of knowing how exactly these things \nwill play out in the session at hand. One of the major traps of price tech­\nnical repetition is that it may lead a trader to believe that all of it can be \npredicted. It can't. It can only be anticipated.

      "text": "Chapter 8 \nRecap Part I \nwe have at our service the best possible guide we could ever wish for, \nthe market itself, there is no need for a crystal ball to come out ahead. \nIn the lows of the first decent pullback, the three-bar combi 4-5 may \nhave been strategically placed about halfway the 1-2 bull swing, but it \nwas too weak a setup to oppose the rather prominent M-pattern resid­\ning overhead (2-3). With such solid obstruction blocking the path, the \nsituation simply called for more buildup. This is basically a variation on \nthe harmony theme, and I can only hope it makes sense. \nIn this respect, the 4-7 block, a W -pattern middle-part hanging be­\nlow the 50-level, built up the tension in much better fashion. In fact, \none could hardly wish for a better setup: (a) its horizontal span now had \nsufficient body to counter the bearish M-pattern overhead; (b) it was a \nWw-variant; (c) the box resided in the 50 percent region of the forego­\ning bull swing; (d) the entry above it suffered no adverse magnets; (e) \nshould prices at some point after the break have come back to test the \nbreakout, they stood to bounce favorably right on the 50-level support, \ncoinciding with the top of the box. \nThere were two ways to have taken position on the box breakout: \neither enter on the break of combi 6 (little aggressive still), or one bar \nlater, above bar 7, when the box barrier was visibly broken. \nA 20 pip target will have been reached before the highs of 2 and 3 \nwere met; should this level have fallen shy, a resistance exit will have \nbeen a valid call. When the earlier highs indeed proved obstructive (note \nthe classic false break trap at F), the market went about printing yet \nanother M-pattern middle-part (F-8). \nShould we have traded the bear break for failure, above bar 9? It is \nan easy skip, since it isn't wise to resort to these tactics when the mar­\nket is no longer in trending mode (despite the bullish dominance, the \nmarket was ranging for over four hours). The break above combi 10 is \nan easy skip as well. There was just too much resistance to overcome \nfor this to represent a high-odds play. \n241 \n",

Like cardiologists, we opened up \nthe chest of the 5-minute frame, cut through the tissue, pushed aside \nthe ribs and laid bare the mechanics of its wondrous beating heart. As \nwe dug in further, we learned all about price action principles and the \ntelling messages within. As our journey went on, we picked up valuable \nlessons on strategy and tactics, and slowly came to see how all these \nfindings can be molded into a viable plan of attack. Nonetheless, as \nmuch as all this can make perfect sense from the safety of the drawing \nboard, a vital question still remains: how does price action trading hold \nup in practice? \nWhile no guide could ever begin to describe the true essence of what \nit means to trade live, let alone explain the many pitfalls and emotional \nchallenges a trader will surely come to face in battle, this second part of \nthe book is put in to at least give the student a fair view on the continuity \naspect of price technical repetition. It can of course be argued whether \nsix months of consecutive intraday sessions sufficiently mitigates the \nelement of cherry-picked material, but there is a limit to what a trading \nbook can do. If nothing else, this unique series of close to 400 charts \nwill furnish the price action student with a massive database of anno­\ntated intraday activity. \nBefore we dig in, allow me to point out some basic details regarding \nthis series.

This means that, in Central European time (CET), the \ntrading opportunities are picked up from the EU Open at 08:00 to about \nthe close of the London session at 18:00. However, the bulk of the pre­\nceding Asian session is incorporated also in order to make a technical \nassessment of the EU and UK Open possible. \nWhile our studies are all done on the eur/usd 5-minute, do recall \nthat we used this instrument solely as a platform for price action analy­\nsis; all is applicable to any market and time frame of choice. Of course, \nit will certainly pay to always study the instruments and time frames \nof your liking with appropriate attention for their personal characteris­\ntics, and particularly in regard to the time wnes in which you wish to \ntrade them. As to the latter, the eur / usd pair may very well offer decent \nopportunities outside the hours mentioned (think Asian Open), but in \norder to optimize the educational value within the available space, it is \nchosen to focus on the instrument's most active stretch. On a 24-hour \ntime axis, the hours in CET can more or less be divided as follows: \n00:00-08:00: Asian session. \n08:00-09:00: EU Open. \n09:00- 10:00: UK Open. \n12:00- 14:00: EU/UK Lunch Hours. \n15:30- 18:00: UK/US overlap. \n18:00-20:00: US Lunch Hours. \n20:00-22:00: End of US session. \nFor the purpose of clarity, the daily sessions in the coming series are \ndivided into three charts each (with sufficient overlap), starting at the \ntop of a page, ending at the bottom. So each new page represents a new \ntrading day. On six months, this will amount to 132 trading days in \ntotal. \nSince we have already discussed the price action concepts and trad­\ning techniques most extensively in earlier chapters, chart explanations \nare kept to a minimum and are done in annotated format.

As ad­\ndressed earlier on, good and bad fortune on any individual wager may \nhave quite an impact on a single session result, but will balance out \nmore or less evenly in the long run. \nNote: These six months of intraday charts should give a decent \nimpression of average volatility per session in a \"normally active\" en­\nvironment, but it still represents a small window of price technical \nconditions that may not match up with the nature of the present-day \nenvironment. Always a common theme in currency land is to see a \nsession go relatively flat in anticipation of a news report and then go \nhaywire the moment the numbers are released, only to go flat again \nsoon after; rarely a week goes by without at least one such stale ses­\nsion printed. From time to time, however, these conditions can persist \nfor weeks or even months on end. Whereas some strategies may thrive \npleasantly in a slower climate (think contrarian), breakout traders gen­\nerally fare less well when volatility and follow-through are minimal. This \ncould call for periodic adjustments. Obviously, one way to adapt is to \nshoot for smaller targets. But quite popular also is to switch over to a \nfaster intraday frame. In Chapter 1 1  we will have a close look at how \nthis can be done in a most effective manner. \nAnother excellent remedy with which to counter the issue of a less \ncompliant environment is not necessarily to adjust the plan of attack, \nbut to simply trade more markets simultaneously, and to be very selec­\ntive on each. Three or four markets will usually do. (Tip: an easy way to \nadd an extra monitor to your home setup is to hook it up via a graphic \nadapter in the USB port, rather than replacing the standard dual-head \ncard with an expensive triple or four-head card.) \nTo see the benefits of a multiple-market approach, here's a quick \npreview on some accounting principles to be discussed in Chapter 10. \nWhen adhering to a ratio between risk and reward of 1:2, a winning \ntrade will add 2 \"points\" and a non-scratch loss will take off 1 ;  should \nan intermediate trader score an average of, say, a full winner, a full \nloser and a half 10ser a day, this will amount to about 10 points profit \nper month (a 0.5 point per day times 20 trading days).

But of course it is totally irrelevant from what market(s) these \n10 points are gathered. On four markets it needs an average score of \njust 2.5 points per market per month to get the job done. Seen in this \nlight, it's hard not to praise the virtues of trading three or four markets \nsimultaneously, and especially so in a stale environment with fewer op­\nportunities on the whole. \nThe reflection above is not meant to trap the price action student into \nsilly fantasies of points per months and future riches, it mainly serves \nto stress the importance of always looking at trading from the viewpoint \nof the bigger picture, or at least from a monthly perspective.

Scalpers, \ntrading a single instrument, may want to do so every new session; \nbut the principle of compounding works equally well when done from \na weekly perspective, or even on a monthly basis. Variations on the \ncompounding theme are practically infinite, and all will show different \nresults, but more important than the exact application is to grasp the \nadvantage of steadily increasing units in accordance with a growing ac­\ncount. For ease of use, we will explore the compounding factor based on \nweekly adjustments. \nNote: The following accounting suggestions are specifically geared \ntowards traders who have been showing positive results for, say, at least \na few months. Those still struggling to come out ahead are best advised \nto work on their trade selection first and not think too much about ac­\ncount buildup. They should either do their trading on a paper-trade \naccount or, preferably, on a live account on superlight volume. The lat­\nter option is a great asset of trading spot Forex: you can participate in \nthe actual market and see your orders filled, but without the psycho­\nlogical disadvantage of having too much capital at stake in the learning \nstages. (Many retail brokers allow you to trade as low as nickels and \ndimes.) \nA widely accepted and generally sound idea is to risk between 1 and \n2 percent of capital per trade. While there is of course room on the low \nside, it is strongly advised not to risk more than 2 percent on a single \nwager; sooner or later, such hastiness is bound to backfire-and there \nisn't much call for it either. Compounding units on a more conservative \nrisk model may have the account growing at a calmer pace, but the in­\nevitable drawbacks will have less of an impact also, and in the end, this \nmay benefit account growth much more than slow it down. \nTo fully understand the virtues of compounding let us compare the \ntrading results of two traders who scored the exact same points per \nweek for 48 weeks on end. Trader A kept trading the same units per \ntrade, despite his growing account, yet Trader B incorporated the com­\npounding factor on a weekly basis. Let us further assume that both \n384 \n",

Such can be the power of compounding. \nPlease understand that all of the above just serves to point out the \nvirtues of running a trading business effectively. It is not about pro­\njecting hypothetical riches into the future. These figures, however, do \nillustrate the amazing differences in bottom line between two traders \ndoing the exact same thing, but who take a different approach to ac­\ncounting. It is therefore highly recommended to start implementing the \ncompounding factor into the trading volume as soon as possible when \nprofitable across the board. \nQuite intriguing also is that compounding not only proves its merits \non the positive side of the equation. It works equally well in protecting \nan account from full depletion. In fact, it is virtually impossible to blow \nup an account when strictly abiding by the rules of compounding. Af­\nter all, on a shrinking account, each new week will be traded with less \nvolume (but with the same percentage of capital risk per trade). For \nexample, if we once again picture a trader with a $5,000 account, risk­\ning 2 percent per trade, and we now let this trader lose 2.5 points per \nweek for 48 weeks straight, then his account would still show a positive \nfigure of about $426. \nIn other words, for a non-profitable Forex trader to add funds to a \nshrinking account is a folly, for he can theoretically trade as long as he \nwants without ever depleting his initial stake. Adding funds to fatten \nup an account should only be done when profitable across the board \nand never in a desperate attempt to swing things around by trading \nbigger. Granted, this holds up mainly for the Forex market and may not \napply to futures or stocks, where you may not be able to place a trade \nwithout a certain minimum balance in the account. But do check with \nyour Forex broker on this matter also, because some may have put up \na minimum barrier as well. \nThe great benefit of trading spot Forex, and particularly functional \nwhen compounding, is that we can increase our trade volume in the \nsmallest of increments. Instead of having to add a full contract, as in \nthe case of the futures market, we can add just a handful of units on the \nnext trade if we so desire (100,000 units being a full contract). \nTo check the amazing benefits of compounding for yourself, you \n386 \n",

It's all up \nto the trader. \nNote: It should be stressed that the calculations derived from the \ncompound interest calculator are based on a consistency of points per \nweek that is virtually untenable in practice. Even when two traders take \nout the same points per month, their weekly results will probably differ \nand so will the way they compound. For example, one trader may have \ntaken out 5 points per week for 4 weeks straight (very consistent), and \nin his case the computations of the calculator will match up. But an­\nother trader may hypothetically have scored 0 points in the first three \nweeks and then 20 points in the last. His result for the month will \namount to a lesser total in comparison with his more consistent fellow \ntrader, simply because he had no profits to compound in the first three \nweeks of the month. \nAs we can see, the possible variations on the compounding theme \nare practically infinite and all will show different results. (Think: also \nof losing weeks and having to lower volume on the next week.) In other \nwords, playing around with the calculator can be fun, but it is highly \nrecommended not to indulge in silly fantasies on future riches. More­\nover, once the practical advantages of compounding are established, \nmy advice would be to fully discard this tool. Not only is it unrealistic to \nproject hypothetical gains into the future, should the weekly objectives \nnot be met, this may add an unwelcome element of stress and frustra­\ntion. Much more useful is to concentrate on improving consistency first; \nthe rest will follow by itself. \nAs to deriving the right amount of units per trade, there are calcula­\ntors freely available on the web, but perhaps it is wise to briefly examine \nhow these computations can be done by hand. If you have no direct \nneed for this, just skip the following paragraphs. Anyway, here goes: \nTo compute the amount of units to be assigned on the next Monday's \ntrades, we need to know (a) the account balance, (b) the risk model, and \n(c) the \"stop factor\" on the instrument in question. \nTo understand the latter, let us examine the specifications of the \n388 \n",

When doing your calculations by hand, take specific note of \npairs that are quoted with different decimals, such as the Japanese \nyen. Always make sure, though, to check your volume in actual risk per \ntrade. Chances are, your platform will already warn you when a preset \nunit size is way off the mark (margin error notification). \nNote: For \"ease of use\", some brokers do not specify a full contract \nin the standard 100,000 units, instead they name a full contract as 10 \nunits. For example, should you want to trade 135,000 units, you may \nnow have to type in 1 3.5 in the order ticket. And your next possible \nstep up would be 13.6. Although this will affect the exact application \nof unit size in terms of capital percentage, the incremental steps are \nstill small enough to allow a steady increase of trade volume, which is \nwhat compounding is all about. For what it is worth, one silly trade that \ncould have been avoided will have a much bigger impact on your weekly \nearnings than a unit size that was slightly below or above the desired \npercentage. \nTo summarize on the above, let it suffice to say that responsibly \nincreasing your volume along the way, regardless of how exactly it is \ndone, is a most vital aspect of running your business effectively. The \nadvantages of compounding simply cannot be ignored. \n390 \n",

One of the \nmain benefits, as explained in the previous chapter, is to be allowed \nto play almost any volume of choice (on the low side) and to be able \nto increase trade size in the smallest of incremental steps. Further­\nmore, although not equally active in every time zone, the markets are \nopen 24/5 and there is always an interesting Open to play, with usually \nenough action going on in the first few hours of the session to make \nsome decent profits for the day. \nBut there is a drawback also. Although this can hit other markets in \nequal fashion, Forex markets, from time to time, can go very, very stale; \nthis could be due to a news release later in the session, but it is cer­\ntainly not uncommon for currency pairs to travel in a tight, meandering \nrange for days, weeks, and sometimes even months on end. At the time \nof writing these pages, July 20 14, we are currently experiencing record­\nlow volatility (at least on an intraday basis), which is perhaps not so \nstrange if we take into account the unprecedented near-zero interest \nrates across the board and the fact that most central banks have openly \ndeclared not to intervene on the upside anytime soon. \nRegardless of its actual cause, a persistent environment of low vola­\ntility seldom makes for pleasant trading (savvy contrarians might think \ndifferently).

But not all \nis lost. Depending on when you read these pages, the markets may be \nswinging generously to and fro again, but in case low volatility persists, \nor perhaps reappears, let's have a look at how we can deal with these \nmatters in terms of adaptation. \nFirst of all, it should be noted that the price action principles are \nnever affected, for they stand above the nature of the session; as long as \nthere are traders around, action will cause reaction and this will have \nthe principles of supply and demand do their thing as in any active ses­\nsion. Consequently, there isn't much need for revising the game plan \non a technical basis; the changes will mostly regard strategic procedure. \nTypical adjustments that spring to mind are to tighten the standard \nbracket to a smaller span (if only on the target side) and to lay very low \non quick continuation trades that stem from little buildup, particularly \nwhen the highs or lows of the session are in play. Another popular ad­\njustment is to switch over to a faster time frame, in the hopes of finding \nmore opportunities in the smaller motions of the market. \nExperienced traders, having seen every possible climate a hundred \ntimes over, may not find it too hard to adjust their game to a slower \npace; for a novice trader, lacking technical reference and overall experi­\nence, this may not be so easily done and it could take a serious number \nof losing or otherwise aborted trades to even come to terms with the \nchange in climate. Of course, a novice, too, will quickly come to realize \nthat the conditions are out of the ordinary and that follow-through on \nbreakouts is often treacherously brittle; but it is no easy chore to come \nup with an adequate answer on how to adapt to this kind of setting. \nThis chapter is meant to offer some insights on the matter, but before \nwe proceed, allow me to suggest a very worthy alternative first, which \nis not to adjust, but to simply set up more markets to trade. Needless \nto say, this doesn't release a trader from practicing patience still, but \nat least it is fair to assume that trading more markets simultaneously \nshould increase the amount of opportunities offered. By trading, say, \nfour markets, as opposed to a single instrument, it requires a mere \nfourth of the average points per market to come out ahead with similar \n392 \n",

In addition to adding markets, a trader could also \nsplit up his working day into two shifts, so as to focus on the hours of \nmost activity, which are usually the first few hours following an Open. \nFor example, Asian traders can trade the Asian and the EU morning \n(00:00-04:00 and 08:00- 12:00 CET). European traders can trade the \nEU and US morning (08:00- 12:00 and 14:00- 18:00); American traders \ncan trade the early US morning, and then perhaps give it another go in \nthe Asian Open later on (14:00- 18:00 and 00:00-04:00). \nBut even with these countermeasures in place, days may still go \nby without a single trade running to target, or even being offered in \nconservative fashion-such can be the nature of a stale environment. \nYet if you can see past the foolish notion of needing to score profit on a \ndaily basis and instead look upon your business from, say, a monthly \nperspective (or yearly, for that matter), the prospects for decent returns \nare seldom very bleak, even in poor conditions. \nSo why adjust at all?

Depending on the current pace of the market a 200-tick set­\nting could resemble a 2 or 3-minute frame on a Forex chart, but this is \nnever a matter of absolutes. A specific advantage of the tick frame set­\nting is that when there is little trading done, the chart does not have to \nprint an obligatory bar as in the case of a time frame setting; instead it \nwill accumulate whatever is traded and then only print a bar when the \npreset tick number is matched. Thus, where a stale phase might print, \nsay, thirty non-descriptive bars in a row on the 2-minute frame (an hour \nof nothingness), on a 200-tick chart this may only show, say, six such \nbars. But as soon as the action picks up pace, the 200-tick and the \n2-minute frame may start to resemble one another more closely again. \nThe above implies that by trading the 200-tick frame, we can benefit \nfrom the advantages of a faster time frame, like the 2-minute, but with­\nout the disadvantage of seeing the chart stretched out into nothingness \nwhen there is little trading done. \nIn all fairness, tick charts are not unanimously appreciated and \nthere is indeed a disadvantage when compared to time frame charts: \ndue to the endless variety of possible settings, and not to mention the \nfact that different providers produce different tick data (we'll get to that \nin a minute), few tick chart traders will look at the exact same action, \nbar-wise, on their screens. It can therefore be argued that the break of \na tick bar may not trigger the kind of spicy response that is often seen \non the break of a time bar. On a faster chart, however, this is seldom an \nissue of concern. Since we aim to trade away from buildup, the break \nof a signal bar on the 200-tick is not likely to be a standalone event, not \neven on a swift pullback reversal. There are always more bars involved \nand together they will set up our buildup boundaries in very visible \nfashion, just like we have come to appreciate on the 5-minute frame in \nour earlier studies.

For starters, it is recommended to replace the thinly plotted 00 \nand 50-levels with the so-called 20-levels in the chart (00, 20, 40, 60 \nand 80). This is not to imply that the 50-level has lost relevance, most \ncertainly not, but in a low-volatility environment, prices do show a re­\nlentless tendency to back and fill between two 20-levels, for hours on \nend, rather than marching more voluptuously between 00 and 50. (But \nalways pay extra attention in the area between 40 and 60.) Surely this \nmeandering habit is detectable also on the 5-minute frame, but a faster \nchart might offer a better chance for exploitation. With this tighter per­\nspective in mind, however, it is recommended not to shoot for 20 pip on \na single breakout, but to look more in the range of 8 to 10 pip targets. \nOn the stop side, protection can usually be set within an 8 pip range, as \nwill be shown. It is of course essential to keep the spread as close to 1 \npip as possible. On popular pairs like the eur/usd, aud/usd and usd/ \njpy, this should not be a problem with most brokers. Attached to your \nentry, you can set up a bracket with, say, a 12 pip target and 10 pip \nstop, but your exits are best executed on a discretionary basis within \nthis range, especially on the stop side. You can enter also with an open \ntarget, but always put in a stop to minimize the harm in the event of a \nplatform crash or connection failure. \nSo let's have a look at a practical example.

Although this audjusd \nchart may seem suspiciously cherry-picked for its beauty and double­\npressure follow-through, this type of price action, and the box breakout \nin particular, is a very common sight, as any modest backtest will con­\nfirm. \nAs to the technicals, the top barrier of the box was easily found. The \n2-3 element on the other side was a higher double bottom with the low \nat 1 ;  the 4-5 progression was a classic squeeze between the 25ema and \nthe top of the box. Note also how the 80-level played a crucial role in \nthe bearish defense. You can enter on the break of the box and set your \nstop below the last low in the squeeze prior to entry. (A buildup element \nof 4 pip in span will demand a 7 pip stop, which includes a break on \neither end and a 1 pip spread.) You can place your stop also below the \nabsolute low of the squeeze, but there is little point in setting it wider \nstill (hope-and-pray tactics). For a target, you could of course aim for \nthe DO-level above, but in a slow market that can be quite a distance to \ncover without running the risk of having to exit the trade on a reversal \nbreak first. The suggested alternative here is to pocket the profits on the \nfirst bout of follow-through somewhere halfway the two levels, for about \n8 or 9 pip, and then perhaps see if the market is kind enough to set up \na continuation entry in the direction of the higher magnet. \nNote: Even though the 200-tick setting may print most of the bars \nwithin a 2 to 4 pip range, this doesn't necessarily mitigate their indi­\nvidual significance. Therefore, it is once again preferable to enter long \nabove a bullish bar and short below a bearish one. Naturally, there is \nno escaping the many neutral dojis on this frame.

More interesting was the follow-up action, the \nT -3 squeeze.

For example, when the \npost-breakout action failed to break back the broken pattern line and \nthen was broken on the bear side in turn (nice six-bar break below 4), \nthis made the 20-level a very likely level to be targeted. Furthermore, \nif in position from below bar 3, a bear could now trail his stop above \nthe new squeeze, risking only a few pip in a worst-case scenario.

As bulls conspicu­\nously failed in reaching the 20-level above, this will have turned plenty \nof eyes in the direction of the OO-level, particularly with such a fine pat­\ntern line in place. Depending on one's appetite for aggression, an option \nmay have been to short the break of the pattern line in bar 4 straight­\naway, so as not to run the risk of missing the ride to the magnet. But \ndefinitely shortable was the break below bar 5, a classic pattern break \npullback entry. \nQuite commonplace in a slow market is a first-touch bounce on a \nround number (at 6). If not yet on target, such development could quick­\nly eat back all the current profits on the trade; but rather than being \nupset or fearful, it is crucial to keep assessing the odds from a prob­\nability perspective. Below the pattern line, bears still had the best of the \naction, meaning that prices were more likely (technically speaking) to \nbend down to the OO-level again than to shake out the trade beyond the \nlast arch on top of the pattern line. Should prices indeed turn favorably \nagain, it is up to the trader whether to stay in for a 20-level breach or \ngrab profits in the level second time around and be done. The overall \npressure of the session could have a say in this decision. \nIf out on the trade, definitely not a good idea would have been to re­\nposition the short in bar 7 or thereabouts. Apart from this being done \nin the tricky area of the prominent OO-level, just consider the distance \nto the 25ema.

Quite the \ncontrary, things are very much the same. \nThis is a picture of the Nasdaq 100 e-mini. I set up the chart with a \n200-tick frame but it merely shows an example. The time axis depicts \nthe hours in EST, meaning a standard session of the underlying market \nwould run from 9:30 (US Open) to 16:00 (US Close); but futures can be \ntraded also in the hours outside this stretch. While activity tends to be \nminimal in the after-hours, it usually picks up in the pre-hours of the \nnext day, when the EU IUK markets are up and running. Understand­\nably, action is the heaviest around the US Open, or perhaps already one \nhour before if major US news is released at 8:30 EST (which is 14:30 \nCET). \nNot seldom, the US opening hour will print some very tall and fickle \nbars on a 5-minute frame, which can be rather cumbersome to trade, \nespecially with a tight stop. To cut the bars to a smaller span you can \nof course set up a faster time frame, say, the 2-minute, but I would \nrecommend using a tick chart setting on account of the benefits men­\ntioned earlier on.

The break at F was a clas­\nsic false break trap; the one at T, despite the better buildup, showed all \nthe makings of a tease break venture. Note that this picture displays \njust an hour of price action, so there is not much info here on the \npressures of the overall session. Nonetheless, bulls who took a shot at \nthe range break at F were simply asking for a good whack. Bears who \nshorted at T are best advised to work on their patience. \nDefinitely more interesting was the break above bar 4 which came \nabout as a consequence of the 1-4 buildup, which in turn had found \ntechnical footing in the cluster on the left. This was an ascending tri­\nangle variant hanging from the pole T- l .  Consequently, you could play \nthis break with a technical target equaling the T - 1  stretch, which would \nbring prices more or less to the next 5-level at 3.875. A stop could be \nplaced either below bar 4 or bar 3, but there is little point in setting it \nbelow bar 2 or lower still; after all, the premise behind trading a break \nfrom a buildup progression is that prices should either follow through in \ndouble-pressure fashion, or the trade is best closed out with a minimal \nloss without much ado. \nSince this break took place in mid-range, it would have been rather \noptimistic to have aimed for a target that equaled the width of the box \nwhen counted from the top barrier.

Not only was it a low-odds continuation \nattempt technically, the break was set straight into the close of the pre­\nvious session at 16:00. Even if presented during regular trading hours, \njust look at where a technical stop needed to be placed (below bar 1). \nThat's way too far out for our taste. \nNext day, early in the EU morning, the 3-4 bear swing had put in a \n\"ceiling\" test with the floor of the 1-2-3 arch, which was eagerly bought. \nNot surprisingly, little of this enthusiasm was left when prices entered \nthe danger zone of the double-top in the round number above (1-3). \nEventually this had the market sliding down to the OO-level in the 5-6 \nbear swing. \nWith this downswing quite prominently displayed, plenty of bears will \nsurely have started to examine their pullback reversal options within \nthe 6-8 follow-up. This was a rather rough bear-flag formation hanging \nfrom the pole 5-6, and had taken a few hours to complete. Notice the \nfalse high at 7 (what were these bulls thinking), which was essentially \nan aborted ceiling test with the low of bar 5. About an hour later, combi \n8 set up a double-bar break outside the boundary of the flag, but still \npleasantly close to the base of the 25ema (no adverse magnet on entry). \nOn this short, prices needed to break the OO-level to offer decent \nprofit, but it's fair to say that the action set up thick enough to take a \nshot on the sell side here. The dotted line depicts a level of a former low \nfrom the previous session, which may have served as a resistance exit \nlevel as an alternative to the low of bar 6. Some bears may even have set \nup their short targets at a level that would more or less mimic the length \nof the 5-6 bear swing, measured from the high of combi 8, but that can \nbe regarded as quite optimistic, particularly if we take into account the \nbounce potential at the dotted line, if only for prices to test back the \nprominent OO-level magnet. \n417 \n",

This is not to say that the break was a definite skip in a bearish \nmarket (which is after all dependent on one's appetite for aggression), \nit is just to point out that we should not forget to assess the overall \npressure first so as to determine whether the conditions are not too \nunfavorable to play along for the ride. \nShould the earlier action have been very bullish, though, then we \ncan basically regard the 1-2 bear swing as a pullback that tested the \nDO-level magnet, and from this perspective, the pattern break pullback \nentry above bar 5 was of indisputable quality, both in setup and condi­\ntions. \nNote that I plotted the top of the bottom range at 3, the first high in \nthe bounce away from the magnet. This level was only challenged in the \nbreak at T, which was a tease breakout in technical terms and thus a \nskip. Subsequently, the T -5 pullback put in a very familiar ceiling test \nwith the highs of the combi at 4, from which prices bounced up, with \nthe close of bar 5 back outside the range. How many times have we not \nseen a similar flag-shaped pullback as a response to a tease breakout \non our eur/usd charts. \nA good bracket on this trade would be the 50-level target (exit in bar \n418 \n16.850 \n16.BOO \n",

First there appeared an M-pattern in defiance \nof the break, soon followed by a bear-flag (3-5), which had now turned \nthe adverse pressure into an Mm-variant. \nThe false high in bar 4 was a brave attempt of the bulls to worm \nthemselves a way out of the squeeze, but straight into resistance of the \ncluster to the left.

      "text": "Chapter 1 2  \nFinal Words \nIf there has been one leading theme throughout this entire work, it can \nonly reflect the very premise as stated from the outset: the market's \nways are highly repetitive and thus exploitable given practice and time. \nStrategy and tactics may vary from trader to trader, yet all have to abide \nby a small set of elementary principles that repeat over and over again \nin any chart. \nBut please recall that all of the foregoing can only offer a platform for \nfurther trader development. By and large, success as a trader will be a \ndirect function of one's willingness to study price action on hundreds, \nif not thousands of charts; available at the push of a button in any de­\ncent charting package. For the evidence is clear: the markets are not \nparticularly forgiving to those who take their education too lightly or \ndeem themselves above it. But the odds are excellent for all parties who \nembrace a more diligent approach. \nAlways keep in mind that the losses of one will pay for the profits of \nanother. To emerge on the favorable side of this equation simply requires \nthat you study harder than your opponent in the field. There really is no \npoint in putting capital on the line unless you are absolutely convinced \nto have obtained an edge in this game. This cannot be stressed enough. \nSo study hard and give yourself that fighting chance. Aim for your goals, \nbut do take pride and enjoyment in the journey as well. \nBob Volman, July 2014 \n421 \n",
