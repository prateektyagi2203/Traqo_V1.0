My specialties include\nastronomy texts written before 1900, such as Percival Lowell’s clas-\nsic Mars, the first published speculations about the possibility of life\non the red planet (which inspired Jules Verne to write The War of the\nWorlds), and a strange little tome from 1852 that claims astronomer\nWilliam Hershel spotted sheep on the Moon with his telescope.\nMy collection also includes about 200 business books written by\nauthors I have interviewed through the years. My inscribed copy of\nIvan Boesky’s Merger Mania, for example was appraised a few years\nago at $200.\nBut my sentimental favorite is a beat-up old chart book of the\nDow Jones Industrials and Transportation Averages going back to\nDecember 18, 1896, the day the modern Dow Jones averages were\nborn. (Trivia question: Where did the Dow Industrials close after its\nvery first day of trading? Answer: 38.59). Back then, the Industrials\nonly had 12 components, and the Transports, with 20 issues, were\nknown as the Rails.\nA 90-year-old FNN viewer from Virginia offered it to me in the fall\nof 1985.\n“I have been interested in, but not too active in, the market since\nthe early ’20’s” he wrote, “and lived through the ’29 ‘break’ and the\ngreat depression which was a ‘tempering’ influence against excessive\nenthusiasm.”\n\u0002 ix \u0002\n",

I gladly accepted in exchange for a signed copy of\none of Joe Granville’s books.\nThe book was published in 1931 by Robert Rhea, the famed disci-\nple of Charles Dow and of the oldest form of technical analysis, the\nDow Theory. It covers the years 1896–1948, with each page devoted\nto one year’s trading of both averages.\nIt is one big, faded green rectangle, measuring 11 inches high and\n18 inches across. Its heavy cardboard covers are held together by a\ncouple of rusty screws.\nI browse through it once in awhile, marveling at its simplicity.\nEach day’s closing value is designated by a single horizontal hash\nmark meticulously notched on the graph paper.\nNothing fancy. No intraday highs and lows, no trendlines, no\npoints or figures, just a simple daily record of the debits and credits\nof civilization.\nThere is the market panic in December of 1899, when the Indus-\ntrials plunged from 76 to 58 in just 13 trading days.\nThere is the period from July to December of 1914, when, incred-\nibly, the market was closed on account of World War I. Eerily, half\nthe page devoted to that year is blank.\nAnd, of course, there is 1929, when the Industrial peaked on Sep-\ntember 3 at 381.17 and hit a bottom, three pages later, in July of\n1932 at 41.22.\nThe book means a lot to me. Between its covers there is a bit of his-\ntory, some mathematics, a dose of economics, and a dash of psychol-\nogy. It has taught me much about a discipline that I once considered\nvoodoo.\nGood journalists are supposed to maintain an open mind about\nthe stories they cover.

And they should also be\nfamiliar with both fundamental and technical analysis.\nI remember the first time I interviewed a technical market analyst in\nthe fall of 1981, when I was still cutting my teeth on business news.\nThis analyst spoke of 34-day and 54-week market cycles and head-\nand-shoulder bottoms and wedge formations. I thought it was so\nmuch mumbo-jumbo until the summer of 1982 when the bull market\nwas launched, and the fundamental analysts were still bemoaning the\ndepths of the recession that gripped the economy at the time. That\nwas when I realized the technicians may have something there.\nHe doesn’t know it, but Greg Morris taught me a lot about tech-\nnical analysis. Or, more accurately, his N-Squared software did. For\na couple of years during the mid-1980s, I hand-entered the daily\nNYSE advance/decline readings and the closing figures of a few mar-\nket indices into my computer. I used N-Squared to build charts and\ndraw trendlines. (I hadn’t yet learned about modems and download-\ning from databanks.)\nThe slow, painstaking process gave me a hands-on, almost organic,\nfeel for the markets. And watching various repetitive chart patterns\nunfold on the computer screen was a great lesson about supply and\ndemand and about market psychology.\nI think I understand how technical analysis works. It’s the why\nthat still puzzles me. I understand the supply and demand implica-\ntions of support and resistance levels, for example, and I appreciate\nthe theories behind pennant formations and rising bottoms.\nBut I still marvel at what ultimately makes technical analysis\nwork: that intangible something that causes technicians to anthropo-\nmorphize the markets without even realizing it. The market is tired,\nthey say. Or the market is trying to tell us this or that. Or the market\nalways knows the news before the newspaper do.\nThat something, in my mind, is simply the human side of the mar-\nxi \u0002\nForeword from the Second Edition\n",

But too many ana-\nlysts have a mathematical blind spot, and I blame that on computers.\nYes, charts represent numerical relationships, but they also depict\nhuman perceptions and behavior.\nEnter Sakata’s Candlesticks, which combine the highly quantita-\ntive ratiocination of American technical analysis with the intuitive\nelegance of Japanese philosophy. Greg Morris has more that ably\nturned his attention to this fascinating charting style with this book.\nIt occurs to me that Japanese Candlesticks are the perfect form of\ntechnical analysis for the 1990s. I happen to agree with authors John\nNaisbett and Patricia Aburdene. It won’t necessarily be an overtly\nreligious period, mind you, but rather one subtle, intuitive power we\nmay all develop that allows us to sense things before they actually\nhappen. It will be a period that embraces a kind of hybrid Eastern\nphilosophy and Western practicality without all the New Age hocus-\npocus.\nJust right for Candlestick analysis. The system is precise and exact-\ning, but it charms with its haiku-like names for charts patterns:\n“paper umbrella,” or “spinning tops,” for example.\nBut I’ll let Greg Morris tell the story from here.

I opened my first office in June 1982 only two months\nbefore the stock market embarked on an 18-year secular bull market.\n(I thought I was the catalyst for the market’s improvement!) I was\nyoung and knew everything—or at least I thought so. It didn’t take\nlong for me to realize that not only did I not know everything; I actu-\nally knew very little. The investment world is a big place and the con-\nfounding truth is there is no single “right” way to do it. There are\nmany good ideas and strategies but none are perfect.\nI considered myself quite mature at the ripe age of 21, but thank-\nfully I was alone in that assessment. There were very few people\nstanding in line to get investment advice from a kid, which was a\ngood thing because as a result, I had little opportunity to do any\ndamage.\nOne benefit of youth is an openness to ideas, and by setting out on\nmy own I was fortunate to have escaped the traditional training of\nthe big brokerage firms. No one brainwashed me into believing their\nway was the only way, so I was able to listen and learn without bring-\ning a lot of preconceived notions to the table. To use a good South-\nern phrase, “I wasn’t set in my ways” yet.\nAs we were in the midst of what would become the most unprece-\ndented bull market in history, my first experience with a market hic-\ncup was the 1987 crash.

I was drinking the\nKool-Aid.\nThe cyclical bear market in 1990 was similar to the 1987 bear—it\ndidn’t last very long and the recovery time was less than a year—but\nit was different for me because by that time I had real clients with real\nmoney! I was being asked real questions about ways to manage risk\nin a portfolio and I didn’t have any answers. That’s when technical\nmarket analysis finally popped up on my radar screen.\nIn 1991, Don Beasley and I formed what would become PMFM,\nInc., a registered investment advisor managing money using technical\nmarket analysis. Our goal was to deliver reasonable returns without\nthe roller coaster ride and risks that come with buy-and-hold.\nTechnical analysis is still not “mainstream” because the buy-and-\nhold approach is so much easier for brokers and financial advisors,\nbut in the wake of the recent bear market, investors are finally taking\nnotice. In 2000–2002 a ferocious bear kicked down the door and pro-\nceeded to destroy all those market “truths” that had been ingrained\nsince 1982. This bear market wasn’t brief; twenty percent drops were\nnot good buying opportunities; and the overall damage was severe.\nNow, more than five years after the slide began, we are still a long way\nfrom breaking even on most indices. Unfortunately it took the worst\nbear market since the Great Depression to bring technical market\nanalysis the attention it deserves, but I am thankful that our approach\nallowed us to preserve our clients’ money and actually post a positive\nreturn over that dreadful three-year period.\nOver the past decade, I have come to appreciate how vast the\nstudy of technical analysis really is.

Other than Nison’s work, the only problem has\nbeen the lack of detailed information on how to use and identify them.\nNot only will this book solve this problem, but it will also provoke an\nintellectual curiosity in candlesticks that will not easily disappear.\nJapanese candlesticks provide visual insight into current market\npsychology. There is no ancient mystery behind Japanese candle-\nsticks, as some promoters would have you believe. They are, how-\never, a powerful method for analyzing and timing the stock and\nfutures markets. That they have been used for hundreds of years only\nsupports that fact. When candlesticks are combined with other tech-\nnical indicators, market timing and trading results can be enhanced\nconsiderably.\nIt is almost regretful that this sound analysis technique was intro-\nduced to the West using the word “candlesticks” instead of some\nmore appealing or appropriate terminology, such as Sakata’s Meth-\nods or Sakata’s Five Methods. If candlesticks’ Western debut had\nfocused on the uncovering of an ancient Japanese analysis technique\ncalled Sakata’s Methods, I believe their acceptance would have been\nquicker and more widespread.

While\nstaying in his home, we thoroughly discussed the entire realm of\nJapanese culture related to candlestick analysis. His extensive knowl-\nedge and dedication to the subject made my learning experience not\nonly enjoyable, but quite thorough. His insistence that I try to under-\nstand the psychology at the same time was instrumental in learning\nmany of the pattern concepts. I hope that I have transposed that\npriceless information into this book.\nThis is a book that not only covers the basics, but offers more\ndetail into exactly how to identify and use the patterns. A compre-\nhensive analysis and recognition methodology will be presented so\nthat you will have no doubt in your mind when you see a candlestick\npattern. In addition to a thorough coverage of the candlestick pat-\nterns, the philosophy of their use will be discussed so that you will\nhave a complete understanding of the Japanese candle pattern analy-\nsis and its usefulness to market timing and strategies. Candle Patterns\nneed to be defined within parameters that people can understand and\nuse in their everyday analysis. This can still involve flexibility as long\nas the limits of that flexibility are defined, or at least explained.\nAn attempt to take the subjectivity out of Japanese candlesticks\nanalysis will be primary thrust of this book. Most sources that deal\nwith candlesticks admit that patterns should be taken into the con-\ntext of the market. This is true, but is often an excuse to avoid the\ncomplicated methodology of pattern recognition.\nChapters on statistical testing and evaluation will reveal, totally,\nall assumptions used and all details of the testing results. Rigorous\ntesting has been done on stocks, futures, and indices. Some of the\nresults were surprising and some were predictable.

Charting exam-\nples will be shown in this book only as learning examples of the can-\ndle patterns being discussed. It definitely helps to see the actual\ncandle patterns using real data.\nI could not have allowed myself even to start a project as involved\nas this if I had even the slightest doubt as to the viability and credi-\nbility of using Japanese candlesticks as an additional tool for market\nanalysis and timing.

Hence, this style has played a vital part in the structure\nand organization of this book.\nThis book will not only introduce and explain all of the inner\nworkings of Japanese candlesticks, but will also serve as a reference\nmanual for later use.

Many of these were created to fill the holes\nin the original Japanese versions of the patterns. A large number of\noriginal Japanese patterns did not have a complement or counterpart;\nthere was either a bullish version or a bearish version, but not both.\nThose holes have been filled, along with a handful of new patterns.\nWhen you study these patterns for all these years, one easily can start\nto see how new things can develop. Steve North of North Systems was\nthe originator of many of these complementary and new patterns. If\nyou see these patterns in other books or articles on candlesticks, be\nsure to ask the author where he/she obtained the information.\nSo after 14 years, what has changed? Computers are readily avail-\nable; certainly computing power growth has exceeded even Moore’s\nLaw. Almost all data services offer stock data that has the open price\navailable. In 1992 that was definitely not the case, as I addressed it \nin Chapter 6. The internet has offered charting services such as\nStockCharts.com, that make the term software almost obsolete; all\nyou need is a browser. Intraday data is certainly more readily avail-\nable.

How can you have a bullish reversal\ncandle pattern if you not in a downtrend? You can’t. Remember,\nthese short-term views of investor psychology are based upon the\ntrend of the market.\nI still hear and witness analysts making much more out of candle\npattern analysis than they should. It is not magical; it is not the key\nto instant profit; it is just simply another good short-term tool for\nmarket analysis and trading. Candle pattern analysis should always\nbe supplemented with other analysis techniques.\nIn this edition, I added considerably more information on the\nmeasures of success for candle patterns relative to many other tech-\nnical indicators. I also enhanced the statistics that support the candle\npattern filtering concept I introduced in the first edition.\nI have also shortened my view on the viability of using candle pat-\nterns. In the first edition I mentioned that they were fairly reliable up\nto about nine market days. Today, I strongly believe that anything\nover five days is coincidental and random.

This\nwill help in understanding the psychology behind the many candle\npatterns described in later chapters. There are a few candle patterns\nthat consist of only a single candlestick and also qualify as reversal\npatterns. They will be covered thoroughly in the chapter on reversal\npatterns.\nEach type of candle line has a unique name and represents a possi-\nble trading scenario for that day. Some candle lines have Japanese\nnames and some have English names. Whenever possible, if the name\nis in English, the Japanese name will also be given. The Japanese\nname will be written in a format called Romanji. This is a method of\nwriting Japanese so that it can be pronounced properly by non-\nJapanese-speaking people.

It will be shown in later chapters how most\ncandle patterns can be reduced to single candle lines and maintain the\nsame bullish or bearish connotations.\nLONG DAYS\nReference to long days is prevalent in most literature dealing with\nJapanese candlesticks. Long describes the length of the candlestick\nbody, the difference between the open price and the close price, as\nshown in Figure 2-1. A long day represents a large price movement\nfor the day. In other words, the open price and the close price were\nconsiderably different.\nHow much must the open and close price differ to qualify as a long\nday? Like most forms of analysis, context must be considered. Long\ncompared to what? It is best to consider only the most recent price\naction to determine what is long and what is not.

Just like\nthe long day, it depends upon previous prices. If the previous days\nwere mostly Doji, then the Doji day is not important. If the Doji\noccurs alone, it’s a signal that there is indecision and must not be\nignored. In almost all cases, a Doji by itself would not be significant\nenough to forecast a change in the trend of prices, only a warning of\nimpending trend change. A Doji preceeded by a long white day in an\nuptrend would be meaningful. This particular combination of days is\nreferred to as a bearish Doji Star (Chapter 3). An uptrend that, all of\na sudden, ceases to continue, would be caused for concern. A Doji\nmeans that there is uncertainty and indecision.\nAccording to Nison, Doji tend to be better at indicating a change\nof trend when they occur at tops instead of at bottoms. This is related\nto the fact that for an uptrend to continue, new buying must be pre-\nsent. A downtrend can continue unabated. It is interesting to note\nthat the Doji also means “goof” or “bungle.”\nLong-Legged Doji ( juji)\nThe Long-Legged Doji has long upper and lower shadows in the mid-\ndle of the day’s trading range, clearly reflecting the indecision of buy-\ners and sellers (Figure 2-8).

They have long lower shadows and small\nreal bodies that are at or very near the top of their daily trading\nrange. These were first introduced as paper umbrellas in Chapter 2.\nThey are also special versions of the Tonbo/Takuri lines.\nThe Hammer occurs in a downtrend and is so named because it is\nhammering out a bottom. The Japanese word for Hammer (ton-\nkachi) also means the ground or soil.\nA Hanging Man occurs at the top of a trend or during an uptrend.\nThe name Hanging Man (kubitsuri) comes from the fact that this\ncandle line looks somewhat like a man hanging.\nAnother candle line similar to the Hammer is the Takuri (pro-\nnounced taguri) line. This Japanese word equates with climbing a rope\nor hauling up. The motion is not smooth and could be related to pulling\nup an anchor with your hands: as you change hands; the upward move-\nment is interrupted momentarily. A Takuri line has a lower shadow at\nleast three times the length of the body, whereas the lower shadow of a\nHammer is a minimum of only twice the length of the body.\nRules of Recognition\n1.

There should be no upper shadow, or if there is, it should\nbe very small.\nScenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern\nHammer\nThe market has been in a downtrend, so there is an air of bearishness.\nThe market opens and then sells off sharply. However, the sell-off is\nabated and the market returns to, or near, its high for the day. The\nfailure of the market to continue the selling reduces the bearish sen-\ntiment, and most traders will be uneasy with any bearish positions\nthey might have. If the close is above the open, causing a white body,\nthe situation is even better for the bulls. Confirmation would be a\nhigher open with yet a still higher close on the next trading day.\nHanging Man\nFor the Hanging Man, the market is considered bullish because of the\nuptrend. In order for the Hanging Man to appear, the price action for\nthe day must trade much lower than where it opened, then rally to\nclose near the high. This is what causes the long lower shadow, which\nshows how the market just might begin a sell-off. If the market opens\nlower the next day, there would be many participants with long posi-\ntions that would want to look for an opportunity to sell. Steve Nison\nclaims that a confirmation that the Hanging Man is bearish might be\nthat the body is black and the next day opens lower.\nPattern Flexibility\nFeatures that will enhance the signal of a Hammer or Hanging Man\npattern are an extra long lower shadow, no upper shadow, very small\n29 \u0002\nReversal Candle Patterns\n",

This trait, when\nused on the Hammer, will change its name to a Takuri line. Takuri\nlines are generally more bullish than Hammers.\nThe body color of the Hanging Man and the Hammer can add to\nthe significance of the pattern’s predictive ability. A Hanging Man\nwith a black body is more bearish than one with a white body. Like-\nwise, a Hammer with a white body would be more bullish than one\nwith a black body.\nAs with most single candlestick patterns like the Hammer and the\nHanging Man, it is important to wait for confirmation. This confir-\nmation may merely be the action on the open of the next day. Many\ntimes, though, it is best to wait for a confirming close on the follow-\ning day. That is, if a Hammer is shown, the following day should\nclose even higher before bullish positions are taken.\nThe lower shadow should be, at a minimum, twice as long as the\nbody, but not more than three times. The upper shadow should be no\nmore than 5 to 10 percent of the high-low range. The low of the body\nshould be below the trend for a Hammer and above the trend for a\nHanging Man.\nPattern Breakdown\nThe Hammer and the Hanging Man patterns, being single candle\nlines, cannot be reduced further. See Paper Umbrella in Chapter 2.\nRelated Patterns\nThe Hammer and Hanging Man are special cases of the Dragonfly\nDoji discussed in Chapter 2.

A rally throughout the day fails to hold and the market closes\nnear its low. Similar to the scenario of the Hammer and the Hanging\nMan, the opening of the following day is crucial to the success or fail-\nure of this pattern to call a reversal of trend. If the next day opens\nabove the Inverted Hammer’s body, a potential trend reversal will\ncause shorts to be covered, which would also perpetuate the rally.\nSimilarly, an Inverted Hammer could easily become the middle day of\na more bullish Morning Star pattern.\nShooting Star\nDuring an uptrend, the market gaps open, rallies to a new high, and\nthen closes near its low. This action, following a gap up, can only be\nconsidered as bearish. Certainly, it would cause some concern to any\nbulls who have profits.\nPattern Flexibility\nSingle-day candlesticks allow little flexibility. The length of the\nshadow will help in determining its strength. The upper shadow\nshould be at least twice the length of the body.

In fact, by removing the middle day in the Stick\nSandwich pattern, you will get a Matching Low pattern. A long black\nday continues the downtrend. The next day opens higher, but then\ncloses at the same close of the previous day. This yields two black days\ntogether with their lower bodies (close) equal. This pattern indicates a\nbottom has been made, even though the new low was tested and there\nwas no follow through, which is indicative of a good support price.\nRules of Recognition\n1. A long black day occurs.\n2. The second day is also a black day with its close equal to\nthe close of the first day.\nScenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern\nThe market has been lower, as evidenced by another long black day.\nThe next day, prices open higher, trade still higher, and then close at\nthe same price as before.

The Morning and Evening Doji star patterns do\nexactly this.\nMorning Doji Star\nA downtrending market is in place with a long black candlestick,\nwhich is followed by a Doji Star. Just like the regular Morning Star,\nconfirmation on the third day fully supports the reversal of trend.\nThis type of Morning Star, the Morning Doji Star (Figure 3-71), can\nrepresent a significant reversal. It is therefore considered more signif-\nicant than the regular Morning Star pattern.\nEvening Doji Star\nA Doji Star in an uptrend followed by a long black body that closed\nwell into the first day’s white body would confirm a top reversal (Fig-\nure 3-72).

This means that a downtrend has been in place. The long\nblack day adds to the bearishness already present.\nThe next day opens lower with a gap.

Each day opens within the previous day’s body.\n3. A definite deterioration in the upward strength is evidenced\nby long upper shadows on the second and third days.\nScenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern\nThe scenario of the Advance Block pattern closely resembles the events\nthat could take place with the Three White Soldiers pattern. This situ-\nation, however, does not materialize into a strong advance. Rather, it\nweakens after the first day because the close is significantly lower than\nthe high. The third day is as weak as the second day. Remember, weak-\nness in this context is relative to the Three White Soldiers pattern.\nPattern Flexibility\nDefining deterioration is difficult. Although this pattern starts out\nlike the Three White Soldiers, if doesn’t produce the upward strength\nand each day shows smaller body length and longer shadows. The\nsecond and third day need to trade higher than their closes.\n\u0002 136\nChapter Three\n",

The\npattern starts with a long black day followed by another black day\nwhose body gaps down (Figure 3-153). After the down gap, the next\nthree days set consecutively lower prices. All days in this pattern are\nblack, with the exception of the third day, which may be either black\nor white. The three days after the gap are similar to the Three Black\nCrows in that their highs and lows are each consecutively lower. The\nlast day completely erases the small black days and closes inside the\ngap between the first and second days.\nBearish Breakaway\nThe bearish Breakaway pattern involves a gap in the direction of \nthe trend followed by three consecutively higher-price days (Figure \n3-154). In an uptrend, a long white day is formed. Then the next day,\nprices gap upward to form another white day. This is followed by two\nmore days that set higher prices.

The low prices set in the three days after the gap\nshould also be higher than each previous day’s low price. The idea of\nthis pattern is that prices have accelerated in the direction of the trend\nand an overbought situation is developing. The last day sets up the\ntrend reversal by closing inside the gap of the first and second days.\nJapanese literature does not discuss a bearish version of the Break-\naway pattern. I decided to test such a pattern and have found that it\nworks quite well. See Chapter 6 for results.\nRules of Recognition\n1. The first day is a long day with color representing the cur-\nrent trend.\n2. The second day is the same color and the body gaps in the\ndirection of the trend.\n3. The third and fourth days continue the trend direction, with\ncloses consecutively greater in the direction of trend. It is\nbetter if the third day is white for the bullish case and black\nfor the bearish case.\n4. The fifth day is a long opposite-color day that closes inside\nthe gap caused by the first and second days.\nScenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern\nIt is important to realize what is being accomplished here: the trend\nhas accelerated with a big gap and then starts to fizzle, but it still\nmoves in the same direction. The slow deterioration of the trend is\nquite evident from this pattern. Finally, a burst in the opposite direc-\ntion completely recovers the previous three days’ price action. What\ncauses the reversal implication is that the gap has not been filled. A\nshort-term reversal has taken place.\n183 \u0002\nReversal Candle Patterns\n",

There could be more than three days after the gap as long\nas the last day of the pattern closes inside the initial gap. It is also\npossible to have at least two days after the gap.\nPattern Breakdown\nThe bullish Breakaway pattern reduces into a possible Hammer line\n(Figure 3-155). The lower shadow must be twice the length of the\nbody for it to qualify as a Hammer. This is quite possible if the gap in\nthe second day is large and followed by significantly lower prices on\ndays three and four. This, of course, supports the pattern.\nThe bearish Breakaway pattern reduces to a long candle line with a\nwhite body at the lower end of its range (Figure 3-156).

Strong furiwake lines would be two long bodies\nwithout any shadows (marubozu) at the points where they meet.\nPattern Breakdown\nThe bullish Separating Lines pattern reduces to a candle line with a\nwhite body and long lower shadow (Figure 4-3). This pattern is some-\nwhat bullish and supports the bullish continuation. The bearish Sepa-\nrating Lines pattern reduces to a candle line with a black body near\nthe lower portion of the range (Figure 4-4).

      "text": "Commentary\nThe typical Tasuki line occurs when the price opens lower from a\nwhite line and then closes lower than the previous day’s low. When\nthe price opens higher from a black day’s close and then closes higher\nthan its high is the opposite case. Tasuki lines are mentioned in a\nnumber of sources of candlestick literature, but they do not con-\ntribute enough to be considered as individual patterns. A Tasuki is a\nsash for holding up sleeves. The Tasuki Gaps involve the Tasuki line\nafter a gap in the direction of the current market trend.\nAn Upside Tasuki Gap (Figure 4-24) is a white candlestick that has\ngapped above the previous white candlestick, then followed by a black\ncandlestick that closes inside that gap. This last day must also open\ninside the second white day’s body. An important point is that the gap\nmade between the first two days is not filled. The philosophy is that\none should go long on the close of the last day. The same concept\nwould be true in reverse for a Downside Tasuki Gap (Figure 4-25).\n237 \u0002\nContinuation Patterns\nFigure 4-24\nFigure 4-25\n",

The third day closes into the gap but does not fully close\nthe gap.\nScenarios and Psychology behind the Pattern\nThe psychology behind a Tasuki Gap is quite simple: Go with the\ntrend of the gap. The correction day (the third day) did not fill the gap\nand the previous trend should continue. This is looked upon as tem-\nporary profit taking. The Japanese widely follow gaps (windows).\nTherefore, the fact that the gap does not get filled or closed means\nthat the previous trend should resume.\nThe literature is sometimes contradictory on gaps. One normally\nexpects a gap to provide support and/or resistance. The fact that the\ngap is tested so quickly is reason to believe that the gap may not pro-\nvide its usual analytic ability.\nPattern Flexibility\nThe first day’s color is not as important as the color of the second and\nthird days. It is best that it be the same color as the second day, which\nwould fully support the ongoing trend.\nPattern Breakdown\nThe Upside Tasuki Gap pattern reduces into a long line with a white\nbody at the lower end (Figure 4-26).

You\ndon’t want too much buying to precede this first day, so the day\nbefore the pattern cannot be a white day that is longer than the first\nday of the pattern.\nAdditionally, beware of this pattern if it occurs after a sustained\nuptrend.\nPattern Flexibility\nThe second and third candlestick lines in this pattern represent a\nperiod of rest following the first day’s strong rise. The second and\nthird days are relatively short, and they do not have long bodies.\nSpecifically, the high-low ranges of the second and third days must be\nless than 75% of the high-low range of the first day. And the real\nbodies of the second and third days must occupy less than 50% of the\ndays’ high-low ranges.\nThe second and third days are meant to represent rest, not weakness\nor too much additional strength following the first day. So, the second\nand third days must both close above the midpoint of the first day’s\nhigh-low range. Additionally, the third day’s low must be greater than\nthe midpoint of the first day’s high-low range.

However, once the bulls see\nthat a new low cannot be made, the bullishness is resumed and new\nhighs are set quickly. The falling Three Methods pattern is just the\nopposite.\nPattern Flexibility\nBecause this pattern normally consists of five candle lines, it is some-\nwhat rare to find in its classic form. Some leeway can be allowed \nin the range of the reaction days. They may go slightly above or\nbelow the range of the first day.

This fully supports the bulls’\ncase that this was just a pause in a strong upward trend.\nBearish Mat Hold\nDays two, three, and four are the break in the trend, and you will\nnotice that they never close above the open of the first day. So, by the\nend of day four, traders are beginning to think that any reversal of the\ndowntrend has failed. When the fifth day closes below the open of\nthe second day, the bears know that the prior three days were just a\npause in a strong downward trend.\nPattern Flexibility\nThe second, third, and fourth days of the pattern do not have any\nlength of body requirements, so one or more of these days are com-\nmonly dojis. Additionally, the third and fourth days are permitted to\nbe either white or black. Although white is preferred for both days,\nthe fourth day is often black.\nThe first and fifth days must have long bodies. The body of a can-\ndlestick is the part between the open and the close. A long body is a\nbody that occupies more than 50% of the high-low range.\nThe arrangement of the three small black days should show con-\nsecutive declines, much like the Rising Three Methods. The reaction\ndays are altogether higher than those in the Rising Three Methods.\n\u0002 272\nChapter Four\n",

According to Honma, if you feel\ncompelled to rush into a trade because you believe that you just can’t\nlose, wait three days to see if you still feel the same way. If you do,\nyou can enter the trade, probably quite successfully.\nThe Honma Family owned a great rice field near Sakata and they\nwere considered extremely wealthy in both fact and song. One folk\nsong said that no man can be as wealthy as a Honma: one can merely\nhope to be as rich as a daimyo. A daimyo is the early Japanese term\nfor a feudal lord.\nHonma died in 1803. During this period of time a book was pub-\nlished. “If all other people are bullish, be foolish and sell rice” is\nsome of the advice contained in San-en Kinsen Horoku. This book\nwas published in 1755 and is known today as the basis of Japan’s\nmarket philosophy. Today, in Sakata, a house that once belonged to\nthe Honma family is the Honma Museum of Art.\nAll of the patterns and formations based upon Sakata’s Method are\ntaken from 160 rules that Honma wrote when he was 51 years old.\nSakata’s Method, in turn, is what is now considered the beginnings of\ncandle pattern recognition. Candlestick charting was not actually\ndeveloped by Honma, only the pattern philosophy that goes with it.\nHis approach has been credited as the origin of current candlestick\nanalysis.\nSince Honma came from Sakata, you may see reference to Sakata’s\nLaw, the Sakata Method, Sakata’s Five Methods, Honma Constitu-\ntion, and similar names. While the labels may differ, the analysis\ntechnique remains the same. This book will refer to this approach as\nSakata’s Method.\n\u0002 282\nChapter Five\n",

Here, on the third gap, Sakata’s\nMethod recommends selling because of the conflict of orders and the\npossibility of reaching overbought conditions too soon.

Similarly, if the gap was to the downside, the open price\nwould fall 17 to 31 percent below the high price. Remember, these\nare just statistics calculated from a large amount of data, so the usual\nprecautions are suggested.\nOne must also be aware that certain candle patterns cannot exist if\nthere is no open price. That is, the previous day’s close cannot be sub-\nstituted for the open. The following candle patterns cannot exist\nwhen the open price is not available. This was first written in 1992\nwhen opening price data was not readily available. Since then most\ndata services provide opening prices on all stocks. Coincidentally or\nnot, most of these services started providing open prices in the 1991\ntime frame.\n\u0002 302\nChapter Six\n",

For\nexample, one could set some parameters that relate the data compo-\nnents from “greater than” to “greater than or equal to.” As a result\na requirement that the open of one day should be less than the close\nof the previous day could be modified so that the open could also be\nequal. Although this may stretch the philosophy of candle pattern\nrecognition too far, it at least permits the use of data that does not\ncontain the open price.\nToday’s electronic capabilities let traders watch intraday price\nmovements from single trade ticks, one minute bars, and almost any\nother conceivable increment in between. It is not the purpose here to\ndecide which type is better, but sometimes the trees do get in the way\nof the forest.

This approach never\nremains popular for very long because it is based solely on statistics\nand overlooks an important explanation of why some patterns are\nmore successful than others—human psychology.\nENTER HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY\nIn the first few minutes of the trading day, a great deal of overnight\nemotion is captured. Sometimes special events cause chaos. For exam-\nple, on the New York Stock Exchange, it may take several minutes for\nthe specialist to open a stock for trading because of a large order\nimbalance. However, once a stock or commodity does open, a point\nof reference has been established. From this reference point, trading\ndecisions are made throughout the day.\nAs the trading day progresses, extremes are reached as speculator\nemotion is tossed around. These extremes of emotions are recorded\nas the high and low of the trading day. Finally, the trading day ends\nand the last trade is recorded as the closing price. This is the price\nthat many will use to help make decisions about their positions and\nthe tactics they will use at the open of the next trading day.\nAside from intraday data, four prices are normally available for\nthe trader to analyze. One certainly knows the exact open and close\nprices for any trading day, but at what times during the day the high\nand low were reached, and in what order, are not known.\nHow does one determine the existence of a candlestick pattern?\nMost candle patterns require the identification of not only the\ndata relationship making the pattern, but also the trend immediately\npreceding the pattern. The trend is what sets up the psychology of\ntraders for the candle pattern to develop. Most of the current litera-\nture somehow evades this essential ingredient to candle pattern\nrecognition.\n305 \u0002\nThe Philosophy behind Candle Pattern identification\n",

Any patterns that give\nlonger-term results are surely just coincidental.\nTREND DETERMINATION\nWhat is a trend? This question, if it could be answered in depth,\ncould reveal the secrets of the marketplace. For this discussion, only\na simple and highly reliable short-term answer is sought.\nTrend analysis is a primary part of technical analysis. To some,\ntrend identification is as important as the timing of reversal points in\nthe market. Technical analysis books deal with the subject of trend\nquite thoroughly and define it in numerous ways. One of the most\ncommon approaches is the moving average.\nMoving Averages and Smoothing\nOne of the simplest market systems created, the moving average,\nworks almost as well as the best of the complicated smoothing tech-\nniques. A moving average is exactly the same as a regular average\nexcept that it “moves” because it is continuously updated as new\ndata becomes available. Each data point in a moving average is given\nequal weight in the computation, hence the term arithmetic or simple\nis sometimes used when referring to a moving average.\nA moving average smooths a sequence of numbers so that the\neffects of short-term fluctuations are reduced, while those of longer-\nterm fluctuations remain relatively unchanged. Obviously, the time\nspan of the moving average will alter its characteristics.\nJ.M. Hurst in The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing (1970)\nexplained these alterations with three general rules:\n\u0002 306\nChapter Six\n",

The same moving average also greatly reduces (but does not\neliminate) the magnitude of all fluctuations of duration less\nthan the time span of the moving average.\n3. All fluctuations greater than the time span of the average\n“come through,” or are present in the resulting moving\naverage line. Those with durations just a little greater\nthan the span of the average are greatly reduced in \nmagnitude, but the effect lessens as periodicity duration\nincreases. Very long duration periodicities come through\nnearly unscathed.\nA somewhat more advanced smoothing technique is the exponen-\ntial moving average. In principle, it accomplished the same thing as\nthe simple (arithmetic) moving average. Exponential smoothing was\ndeveloped to assist in radar tracking and flight path projection. A\nquicker projection of trend was needed with more influence from the\nmost recent data. The formula for exponential smoothing appears\ncomplex, but is only another way of weighting the data components\nso that the most recent data receives the greatest weight. Even though\nonly two data points are required to get exponentially smoothed\nvalue, the more data used the better. All of the data is used and is a\npart of the new results.\nA simple explanation of exponential smoothing is therefore given\nhere. An exponential average utilizes a smoothing constant that\napproximates the number of days for a simple moving average. This\nconstant is multiplied by the difference between today’s closing price\nand the previous day’s moving average value. This new value is then\nadded to the previous day’s moving average value.

This large body and small body concept is not\nthe same as the long and short body concept discussed previously. Here\nthe large and small bodies refer only to their relationship with one\nanother. One must decide how much engulfing constitutes an Engulfing\nPattern. If the concept is held to the letter of the law, then only one tick\nor minimum price movement is required to cause an engulfment. Can\nthis be at just one end of the body when the prices are equal at the other\nend? In other words, can the open-to-close range be different by only\none tick? The following formula will let you control this situation.\nSmall Body / Large Body −Maximum (0 to 100%)\nThis inverse of this value can be used for the Harami. It is recom-\nmended to use values that represent what could easily be identified if\nthe determination were made visually. If a small body is engulfed by\na large body by 70%, it means that the small body cannot exceed\n70% of the size of the large body. Said another way, the large body is\napproximately 30% large than the small body.\nUMBRELLA DAYS\nRemember, an umbrella day occurs when the body is at the upper end\nof the day’s range and the lower shadow is considerably longer than\n\u0002 310\nChapter Six\n",

In this example, the lower shadow would\nbe at least twice the length of the body. The upper shadow on an\numbrella day can be handled in a similar fashion, such as:\nUmbrella Upper Shadow / High to Low Range (0 to 100%)\nThe upper shadow is related to the entire day’s range. A value of\n10 means that the upper shadow is only 10% (or less) of the high-low\nrange. These variables will help identify the Hanging Man and Ham-\nmer candle patterns. Patterns such as the shooting Star and Inverted\nHammer use just the inverse of these settings.\nDOJI DAYS\nDoji occurs when the open and close prices are equal.

All common stocks on the New York Stock Exchange,\nthe Nasdaq market, and the American Stock Exchange were used\nover a 13-year period. Using stock data prior to late 1991 would dis-\ntort the analysis because most data services did not provide open\nprices then. Any discrepancies in the summary statistics are because\nnot all of those stocks traded for the full analysis period.\nA total pattern frequency of slightly more than 11% equates to\none candle pattern about every 9 trading days, 8.69 to be exact. This\nrepresents a good frequency for daily analysis of stocks and futures.\nReversal patterns occur about 40 more times often than continuation\npatterns. This too is important, as it indicates the reversal of a trend\ncaused by changed positions in trading. In this analysis, there were\n65 reversal patterns and 23 continuation patterns, which make rever-\nsal patterns account for about 74% of all patterns.\nIt is also interesting to note that only five patterns account for\nabout 6.7% of all patterns.

The number of occurrences gives confidence in the average\nvalue obtained. When dealing with small samples of data, it is how\nthe individual values are distributed that is important. For example,\nif you had only 12 samples and they were all winners, you would be\nmore interested than if there were only 5 or 6 winners.\nRemember, candle patterns were used as a visual charting tech-\nnique for hundreds of years. With computers there is no way to han-\ndle the subjectivity that classic chart reading offers. Another factor to\nconsider when using computers is the quality of the graphics screen:\nits resolution. The screen consists of small dots of light known as\npixel elements. If too much data is used, or if the range of the data is\ntoo great, then what might appear as equal on the screen would not\nbe so numerically. The smallest size (width) horizontal line could\nhave a price range within itself, not visible to the eye. Not only com-\nputer screens, but also computer-generated chart books could have\nthis problem. This is why some flexibility must be built into the iden-\ntification of, and definition of, the classic patterns.\nAnother computer anomaly arises in handling candle patterns that\nare within, or part of, another candle pattern. A computer will look\nat the data in chronological order, that is, old data first. As each day\nis added, a candle pattern may or may not be noted. When a pattern\nis identified, the results are stored and the process continues.

Both assumptions and possibilities have been used\nhere.\nThe Trend Is Known\nCandle patterns fall into two general categories: those that indi-\ncate a reversal of the current trend and those that indicate trend\ncontinuation.\nEach day (for each security), a prediction is made about whether\nthe known trend will continue or reverse for each prediction interval.\nIn other words, if today’s close is above the exponential average\n(trend), then we assume that we are in an uptrend. The success or\nfailure is measured by the change in this trend over the prediction\ninterval. The prediction interval is the number of days into the future\nthe success or failure was based upon. Prediction intervals refer to the\ntime periods between the actual candle pattern and some point in the\nfuture. All of the analysis in this book uses daily data (versus weekly\nor intraday data) for the time intervals.\nWhen a candle pattern occurs, it is offering a short-term forecast\non the direction of the underlying market. The prediction interval is\nthe number of days after the candle pattern that a determination is\nmade as to whether or not the candle pattern was successful. A pre-\ndiction interval is a time in the future that measures the candle pat-\ntern’s forecasting ability.\nOnce a trend starts, the odds are that it will continue. Every stu-\ndent of science or engineering will recognize that this is nothing more\nthan Newton’s First Law of Motion, which says, every body contin-\nues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it\nis compelled to change that state by forces applied to it. Simply said,\nit is easier for a market to continue its direction than to reverse its\ndirection.\n\u0002 318\nChapter Seven\n",

The difference above or below 50% would reflect the direc-\ntional bias of the data used in the analysis.

These\nare further broken down into Up and Down trends (i.e., Reverse Cur-\nrent Trend Up and Reverse Current Trend Down).\nThe sum of Reverse Current Trend success and Continue Current\nTrend success will be equal to the number of days of data used in the\ntesting process.

In other words, the success of Reverse Current Trend is also\nthe failure of Continue Current Trend.\nReversal candle patterns (which most are) are compared to Reverse\nCurrent Trend and further broken down into upturns and downturns.\nBecause reversal candle patterns must go against the very trend that\ndefines them, their measure of success would not be as rigid as that of\na continuation candle pattern. In fact, their measure of success could\nactually be less than that of a coin toss, since they are predicting a\nchange in the current trend, a trend which is supposedly known.\nLikewise, continuation candle patterns are compared to Continue\nCurrent Trend.

This section will explain the technique used to deter-\nmine the various statistics developed to show the success of candle\npatterns. Note that no magnitude of success is used, only a relative\nsuccess and failure.

Because a simple\napproach is usually best, no elaborate assumptions were used, only\nthe price change over various time intervals into the future. Those\ntime intervals were measured in days.\nOnce the relative success or failure of a particular candle pattern\nwas determined, its relationship to the appropriate pattern standard\nof measure was calculated.

The time for this analysis is from April 30,\n2002 to December 31, 2004, a total of 675 market trading days. The\nsecond analysis period (long term) was from November 29, 1991 to\nDecember 31, 2004, a period of 3300 market trading days. Going\nback further in history beyond 1991 can present some real problems\nwith candle pattern analysis, as most data sources do not have accu-\nrate open price information. The data used for both analyses are the\n2277 optionable stocks that are in the NYSE, Nasdaq, and Amex\nexchanges. Optionable stocks, those that have listed options avail-\nable for trading, were chosen because of their liquidity.\nShorter-Term Pattern Analysis (Apr. 30, 2002–Dec. 31, 2004)\nStarting with the shorter analysis period, you can see from Figure \n7-2, using the S&P 500 Index as a representative gauge that this was\na period that reflected a lot of volatility in the marketplace, along\nwith some good trending markets. It began with a strong declining\nmarket, followed by a triple bottom (head and shoulders pattern),\nthen a good bull market ensued until early 2004. The year 2004 was\na downward biased trading range that bottomed in late summer and\nrallied for the rest of the year.\nThe results of this analysis are presented in Tables 7-1 through \n7-7. Each table shows the rankings of the patterns using a different\ntime period for its determination. Table 7-1 uses an interval of 1 day\n\u0002 322\nChapter Seven\n",

There were 1,505,359 days of data\nin this analysis that generated 148,984 candle patterns. This gives an\naverage of a candle pattern about every 10 days. Table 7-2 uses an\ninterval of 2 days, Table 7-3 uses an interval of 3 days, and so on.\nWhy was the analysis only done using intervals up to and includ-\ning 7 days in the future? It is the author’s strong opinion that candle\npattern analysis beyond that time frame is more coincidental than\npredictive. Candle pattern analysis is short term in nature. Any pre-\ndictive value beyond that is purely coincidental. Remember, candle\npatterns are calling for a reversal or continuation of the trend. They\nare not predicting how long it will last.\nTable 7-1 shows the rankings for a one-day interval. In other\nwords, upon completion of the candle pattern, what was the stock\ndoing one day later. If it was above the last day of the pattern, it was\nsuccessful; if it was below the last day of the pattern, it was a failure.\nThe bearish Kicking pattern had a 100% success rate (%Wins), but\nonly had three occurrences in all of the data. Should this information\nbe ignored because of its infrequency? No, just the use of other analy-\nsis tools to confirm it would be wise.\nOut of 68 identified patterns, 28 of them were deemed to be suc-\ncessful based upon the ranking (%Rank) methodology discussed in a\nprevious chapter. Notice that the bullish continuation (C+) pattern\n(No. 12), Separating Lines, had 57% Wins and a %Rank of 10,\nwhile the bearish reversal (R−) pattern (No. 13), Advance Block, also\nhad a %Rank of 10, but its %Wins was 54%. Why would one pat-\ntern that is clearly better by 3% have the same rank? Because one is\na continuation pattern (Separating Lines) and is saying that the very\ntrend that helped to identify it is going to continue. Whereas the\nreversal pattern (Advance Block) was saying that the very trend that\nhelped identify it is going to reverse.\n\u0002 324\nChapter Seven\n",

The number of successful patterns for the one-day prediction\ninterval was 28, whereas the number for the five-day interval was 37,\na 13% increase in successful candle patterns. This further supports\nthe belief by the author of the short-term nature of candle patterns.\nAnother valuable analysis to notice in these tables is how a partic-\nular pattern rises and falls in the rankings as the prediction interval\nincreases.

      "text": "Longer-Term Pattern Analysis (Nov. 29, 1991–Dec. 31, 2004)\nContinuing with the same concept in the previous section, but using\na significantly larger amount of data (almost 5.5 million days), one\ncan see that candle patterns tend to work well in most market envi-\nronments. Figure 7-3 is the S&P 500 Index from November 29, 1991\nto December 31, 2004. During this period, the market experienced a\ngiant bull market, followed by a giant bear market.\nTable 7-8 shows the results of the same analysis as before, only\nusing much more data and the inclusion of many additional candle\npatterns. It is also in a more concise format. These rankings are based\nupon % Wins, the percentage of the time a pattern was successful\nversus being unsuccessful. The reciprocal of %Wins would be\n%Losses (100 −%Wins = %Losses). Each pattern was tested over\nthe same prediction intervals and an average of those seven intervals\nis shown in the last column.\nThe next two tables were created so you could answer the follow-\ning questions:\n1. How well does each candle pattern perform?\n2. What is the best trade exiting method or time frame for\neach candle pattern?\n3. When does each candle pattern perform the best?\n4. When does each candle pattern perform the worst?\nTrades that do not produce either a profit or a loss (i.e., the costs\nof entering the trade exactly equal the proceeds from exiting the\ntrade) are not included in the % Wins (Table 7-8). Trades that do not\nproduce either a profit or loss are included in the Net Profit/Loss per\nTrade (Table 7-9) calculation. The Net Profit/Loss per Trade value is\nsimply the average percent gain (or loss) for all trades. Because the\nNet Profit/Loss per Trade value is the average result for all trades\n341 \u0002\nReliability of Pattern Recognition\n",

      "text": "(winning, breakeven, and losing trades), it can be a positive or nega-\ntive number, or even zero. If the Net Profit/Loss per Trade value is\npositive, it means the average trade produced a net profit. If the Net\nProfit/Loss per Trade value is negative, it means the average trade\nproduced a net loss.\nNote: The Net Profit/Loss per Trade value is the sum of all individ-\nual trade results divided by the number of all trades. If all trades pro-\nduced either a gain or a loss (i.e., there are no 0.00 trade results), then\nthe Net Profit/Loss per Trade value can also be calculated as follows:\nNet Profit/Loss per Trade = (% Winners × Avg Win) \n+ (% Losers × Avg Loss)\nNote: The equation above uses a plus sign because Avg Loss is a\nnegative amount. Also, if you do any of these calculations yourself,\nwatch out for differences caused by rounding of the % Wins and %\nLosses (reciprocal of % Wins) values. For example, the table will dis-\nplay 71% for % Wins when 5 out of 7 trades are winning trades. A\nmore precise value would be 71.4286%. The program used to create\nthis table uses precise values in all of its calculations. The table dis-\nplays the end results of its calculations as slightly rounded values for\npurposes of readability.\nA good candlestick pattern will have positive Net Profit/Loss per\nTrade values across many time frames. And, among those patterns\nproducing a net profit per trade, the better patterns will be those with\nsmaller Avg Loss (100 −% Wins) values (i.e., a −3.00% Avg Loss\nvalue is better than a −6.00% Avg Loss value). Candlestick patterns\nare not perfect, so when a trade doesn’t work out, you want a pattern\nwhose losing trades produce on average limited losses.\nTo use this table you must keep in mind that a success rate of 50%\nor less is not any better than a coin toss and is of no value. The two\nhighest and two lowest averages are emboldened in the last column.\n343 \u0002\nReliability of Pattern Recognition\n",

They consisted of 92 patterns out of\n701,402, which is only 0.013% (a little more than 1 in 10,000).\nNotice the bullish Descent Block (Desc. Block +) pattern and how\nit maintained a good percentage of success over all seven prediction\nintervals. It averaged a 56% success rate, which is excellent. This is\nhow you should use this table.\nFinally, the average of the averages for the seven prediction inter-\nvals is shown at the bottom of Table 7-8. This offers further proof as\nto the merit of candle pattern analysis.

This is an\nattempt to give you that answer.\nThe following tables of data reflect the performance of 14 differ-\nent technical indicators using the perceived popular parameters for\neach one. However, each table uses a different setting for analyzing\nthe candle patterns. The success or failure of a candle pattern is deter-\nmined by the price relative to the last day of the candle pattern. For\nexample, in Table 8-1, the success of a candle pattern is measured by\nthe price one day after the pattern. If the price is lower and it was a\nbearish reversal pattern or a bearish continuation pattern, then the\npattern was deemed successful.

When\nindicators are combined or used in conjunction with one another, the\nresults can only improve. Again, candle patterns are no different:\nwhen used with another indication, the results are superb.\n2005 Note: Other than some minor editing, this chapter continues\nto provide the details necessary to understand and use the candle pat-\ntern filtering concept.

Because candle patterns are intensely depend-\nent upon the underlying trend of the market, lengthy trends in price\nwill usually cause early pattern signals, not unlike most technical\nindicators. Something else had to be used to assist in the qualifica-\ntions of the candle pattern signals. Most technical analysts use more\nthat one indicator to confirm their signals, so why not do the same\nwith candle patterns? The answer is the use of technical indicators.\nWhile appearing obvious, technical indicators did not provide the\n“how” answer to the problem, only the “what.”\nThe following discussions will try to explain the answer to the\n“how” question. Most indicators have a buy and sell definition to\nhelp in their interpretation and use. There is a point prior to a buy or\nsell signal that is normally a better place for a signal to fire, but is dif-\nficult to define. Most, if not all, indicators lag the market somewhat.\nThis is because the components of indicator construction are the\nunderlying data itself.

      "text": "INDICATORS\nThe indicators used to filter candle patterns should be easily avail-\nable and simple to define. They must perform in a manner that\nenables one to determine areas of buying and area of selling. These\nare often referred to as overbought and oversold areas. Indicators\nsuch as Welles Wilder’s RSI (Relative Strength Index) and George\nLane’s %K and %D (Stochastics) are exceptionally good for candle-\nstick filtering because they both remain between 0 and 100. At the\nend of the chapter, many other indicators will be shown to demon-\nstrate the filtering concept. Because RSI and Stochastics are so\nwidely known and used, more detail will be provided on their con-\nstruction and use in filtering.\nWILDER’S RSI\nJ. Welles Wilder developed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the\nlate 1970s. It has been a popular indicator, with many different inter-\npretations. It is a simple measurement that expresses the relative\nstrength of the current price movement as increasing from 0 to 100.\nBasically, it averages the up days and down days. Up and down days\nare determined by the day’s close relative to the previous day’s close.\nDo not confuse Wilder’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a relative\nstrength measure that compares two securities.\nWilder favored the use of the 14-period measurement because if\nrepresents one-half of a natural cycle in the market. He also set the\nsignificant levels of the indicator at 30 to 70. The lower level indi-\ncates an imminent upturn and the upper level a downturn.\nA plot of RSI can be interpreted using many of the classic bar\nchart formations, such as head and shoulders.

Whenever the RSI gets into or near the threshold, a change\nin the trend of prices is soon to follow.\nLANE’S STOCHASTIC OSCILLATOR: %D\nGeorge Lane developed Stochastics many years ago. A stochastic, in\nthis sense, is an oscillator that measures the relative position of the\nclosing price within the daily range. In simple terms, where is the\nclose relative to the range of prices over the last x periods? Just like\nRSI, 14 periods seems to be a popular choice.\nStochastics is based on the commonly accepted observation that\nclosing prices tend to cluster near the day’s high prices as an upward\nmove gains strength and near the day’s lows during a decline. For\ninstance, when a market is about to turn from up to down, highs are\noften higher, but the closing price settles near the low. This makes the\nstochastic oscillator different from the most oscillators, which are\nnormalized representations of the relative strength, the difference\nbetween the close and a selected trend.\nThe calculation of %D is simply the three period simple moving\naverage of %K. It is customarily displayed directly over %K, making\nboth of them almost impossible to see. Interpreting Stochastics\nrequires familiarity with the way it reacts in particular markets. The\nusual initial trading signal occurs when %D crosses the extreme\nbands (75 to 85 on the upside and 15 to 25 on the downside). The\nactual trading signal is not made until %K crosses %D. Even though\nthe extreme zones help assure an adverse reaction of minimum size,\nthe crossing of the two lines acts in a way similar to dual moving\naverages.\nIn Figure 9-4, the same chart of Philip Morris (MO) used in the\nRSI example, we can see how good Lane’s %D is at oscillating with\nthe prices to areas of overbought and oversold.\n367 \u0002\nCandle Pattern Filtering\n",

Also, the trading results are shown\nas if there were a closing trade on the last day of the data to give you\na feel for the complete trading history.\nAdditionally, a signal is generated whenever the appropriate refer-\nence indicator reaches the prescribed parameters. That is, the indica-\ntor must have gone above (or below) the threshold and then cross it\nagain in the opposite direction. For example, when %D goes above\n80, it has entered the presignal area and the sell filter is turned on for\nthe candle patterns. The thresholds of 20 and 80 were used here only\nfor purposes of explanation.\nAll of the indicators require a setting for the number of days (peri-\nods) to use in their calculation. As mentioned earlier, this value should\nreflect the basic cycle of the market being analyzed. Two additional\nvalues need to be set: the upper and lower threshold just mentioned.\nThese are the settings that determine the values that the indicator\nmust reach or exceed before it will filter a candle pattern.\nInitially, commonly accepted values will be used: a 14-day %D,\nfirst with thresholds of 20 and 80 and then with thresholds of 65 and\n35 on different data. The data used will be the stocks of the S&P 100\nindex and the 30 stocks of the Dow Industrial Average. The S&P 100\ndatabase started at the beginning of 1989 and ended on March 31,\n1992. The Dow Industrials database began on April 24, 1990, and\nended on March 31, 1992.\nFILTERING EXAMPLES\nFrom Table 9-1 you can see that trading each stock using candle pat-\nterns for the advice resulted in 67 stocks with positive percentage\ngains and 33 losers. These numbers came simply from counting the\npositive and negative results in the first column. Trading strictly on\nthe candle pattern signals resulted in an average of 37.1 trades, with\nan average gain per trade of 0.40%.\n369 \u0002\nCandle Pattern Filtering\n",

The num-\nber of average trades was reduced to 30.01, with an average gain of\n0.02% per trade.\nUsing the filtering concept for the trading signals resulted in 62 win-\nners and 39 losers. This was not as good as using the candle patterns by\nthemselves, but was much better than using signals generated strictly\nfrom the stochastic indicator %D. The average number of trades was\n13.7, which is better than candle patterns or %D by over 50%. The\naverage gain per trade was 0.60% which, again, is significantly better\nthan the average gain from the other two trading methods.\nWhat does all of this really tell you? First, by filtering the candle\npatterns with an indicator, such as %D, the number of trades is sig-\nnificantly reduced. Compared to candle patterns alone, the reduction\nwas over 63%, and compared to trades using the indicator %D\nalone, the reduction was over 54%. Second, filtering increased the\naverage gain per trade. The increase over candle patterns alone was\n50% and the increase over the %D was over 30 times as great.\nYou should not ignore or forget what is known about using statis-\ntics to make a point; they can be manipulated to show whatever\nresults the author is trying to make.

The problem was in main-\ntaining credibility so that you would not think that the universe was\ncombed looking for the perfect example.

This does not\nnecessarily mean that a trading signal occurred on that day, only that\nthe percentage gain or loss was calculated as if a valid signal had been\ngiven.\nFigure 9-6 shows the %D indicator for 14 days, using threshold\nvalues of 20 and 80 for the trading signals. The total gain for the fil-\ntered candlesticks was not significantly different from that for the\nindicator alone. However, the number of trades was significantly\nreduced, bringing the average gain per trade for the filtered candles\nup to 4.79%, in other words, over 100% better than the indicator.\nChart 9-7 shows the faster %K indicator for 14 days using thresh-\n377 \u0002\nCandle Pattern Filtering\nFigure 9-6\n",

In this example, the filtered can-\ndles were over three times better than %K when looking at the aver-\nage gain per trade.\nBecause %K reacts quicker than %D, one could lower the upper\nthreshold and raise the lower threshold to give a larger filtering area.\nThis would normally generate more trades. For example, by chang-\ning the threshold to 25 and 75, the filtered candles gained 71.6%,\nwith 21 trades for an average gain per trade of 3.41%. Using a larger\nfiltering area was not quite as good as the original example, however,\nbecause although it did, in fact, increase the number of trades it did\nnot increase the overall gain. The results of the indicator %K were\nonly slightly improved to 51.9%. Opening up the thresholds to 30\nand 70 increased the filtered candle trades to 27 with a gain of only\n31.5%. The indicator actually decreased in performance to 45.6%.\nThis shows that the higher thresholds of 20 and 80 tend to produce\nbetter results for filtering without changing the indicator results\nappreciably.\nFigure 9-8 shows Wilder’s RSI for 14 days, with threshold values\nof 35 and 65. The average gain for the filtered candles was over twice\nas good as the average gain from RSI. When you consider that there\nwere also fewer trades, the average gain per trade for the filtered can-\ndles was exceptionally better than RSI.\nFigure 9-9 shows the money flow index. Money flow is calculated\nsimilarly to RSI, but the days when the price closes higher are aver-\naged separately from the days when the price closes lower. In this\ncase a period of 21 days was used for the smoothing of both the up\ncloses and the down closes. Prior to smoothing, the change in price\neach day is multiplied by the volume for that day. This way an up day\nwith large volume would cause a larger move in the indicator than\nwould a similar up day with little volume. Once the two averages are\n379 \u0002\nCandle Pattern Filtering\n",

Rate\nof change is a fairly simple concept that is widely used by many ana-\nlysts. Here a 10-day rate of change is used by taking the percentage\ndifference between the closing price today and the closing price 10\ndays ago. For example, if the value of the rate of change indicator\nwere 7.5%, one could deduce that the price on that day was 7.5%\ngreater than the price 10 days ago.\nThe trading signals for the indicator cannot be given by thresholds\nbecause the up and down values are theoretically unlimited. There-\nfore, the trading signals are generated by the crossing of the indicator\nwith its own 10-period smoothing. Ten periods for the smoothing\nvalue is used for most indicators that work this way. Better values\nmay exist for certain stocks or commodities, but 10 seems to be con-\nsistently good.\nThe rate of change indicator did better than the candle patterns\nand much better than the filtered patterns when looking at total gain.\nBecause the filtered candles almost always result in fewer trades, the\naverage gain was better with the indicators, but not significantly so.\nThe filtering area occurs after the indicator crosses the zero line and\nbefore the indicator crosses its own smoothing.\nFigure 9-11 shows Arms’ Ease of Movement Indicator for 13 peri-\nods. The signal is generated when it crosses its own 10-period\nsmoothing. Ease of Movement is a numerical method used to quan-\ntify the shape of a box used in Equivolume charting. Arms takes a\nration of the box width to the range. Heavy volume days with the\nsame price range results in a higher box ratio and, therefore, difficult\nmovement.\n\u0002 380\nChapter Nine\n",

      "text": "INTRODUCTION\nIn the neurotic world of trading, an edge of any sort can catch on\nquickly. Candlestick charting has steadily gained acceptance among\ntraders and investors over the last two decades. The titillating allure\nof candlesticks comes from their foreign importation and exotic, sto-\nried past. They are now featured in almost every charting service and\nthey are the focus of many Web sites and books. If they were just\nanother way to display open, high, low, and close, they could not\nhave captured the attention of so many people.\nCandles bring with them some 200 years of application and inter-\npretation and that makes them worthy of serious study and integra-\ntion with Western tools, but for 20 years they have spread into the\nmainstream of Western technical analysis with little more than the\ntranslation of the old texts and enthusiasm.\nGreg Morris, one of the original two proponents of candlesticks to\nthe West, was the first to do statistical work on the frequency and\naccuracy of candle patterns, but computing power was so limited\ncompared to now and the public interest was on learning this new\nsystem, not on some data charts in the back of the book. Now,\nfinally, a thorough work has been done to look deep into what can-\ndles really are and are not—to place them in context and properly\nblend their actual skills and value with the tried and true tools of\nWestern charting.\nCandlesticks have been allowed to proliferate without proper per-\nspective. They have gained almost mythical proportion as ancient\nand secret trading tools and self-proclaimed experts abound, but\nwhat are they really? How can they be fully and properly integrated\nwith Western analytics? How accurate are they? Is accuracy their full\ncontribution? What are the “good signals?” Do all the patterns have\nto be memorized?

While\ngreat credit and respect is due the pioneers of candlestick charting of\nthe West, it is past time for this edition.\nGreg Morris recognized the need to enhance and broaden his land-\nmark work, and has done the most comprehensive statistical analysis\never on candlesticks. With the trading application analysis of Ryan\nLitchfield, this book sets the high-water mark for those who want to\nknow how to properly integrate candlesticks into their trading. What\nfollows from Ryan is the practical application and perspective\ntraders need to really put candles in context. Candlesticks are not\nmagical; they make sense, can be easily learned, and are only myste-\nrious to the uninformed. Western pattern charting is far superior to\ncandlesticks for trend and pattern recognition, but the two styles are\nnot in competition. Candlesticks are a very short term (a few days)\nsentiment indicator while Western pattern trading can project price\ntargets and behavior for weeks, months, and years. The delicate\ndance of support and resistance at pivotal price points is tremen-\ndously enhanced when bathed in candlelight.\nTwenty years ago, without modern computing power the proper\nanalysis of candlesticks was not possible and the hungry Western\ntraders created a market that made it unnecessary. All previous\nattempts to do accuracy studies have lacked context and depth. This\ncomprehensive work shines a long overdue bright light on candle-\nsticks, and traders can now properly integrate East and West.\nEAST-WEST SYNERGY\nWhen candlestick charting was introduced to the Western markets it\nwas a novelty, but it now enjoys widespread acceptance.

Some traders seem to get an\nalmost cultish, tunnel-visioned obsession about their favorite secret\nweapon or tool, and while candlestick charting is as good as or bet-\nter than any charting tool, it is not a mysterious or magical secret\nweapon to divine the markets.\nWith about 200 years of application, candlesticks are the most\ntried and tested charting methodology, and they can be quite good at\ninterpreting and predicting short-term behavior and short-term chart\nmovement. Over the last century the West has also developed some\ngreat tools for chart pattern reading and technical analysis. The good\nnews is that when properly integrated, candlesticks and Western chart\nanalysis can combine to form a sum that is greater than its parts.\nThis chapter is focused on providing a foundation for traders to\nappreciate the real value and contribution that candlestick charting\ncan make to Western traders. Details of pattern construction, recog-\nnition, and application will be explored in later chapters.\nCandlesticks along with other technical toys and tools are of little\nvalue to a trader unless properly trained in their use. Unfortunately, the\nmajority of traders who try to incorporate candles into their trading\nmisunderstand what candlesticks can do, and generally expect more\nfrom candlesticks than they are capable of delivering. Traders should\nnot expect candlestick signals to divine the market and call out trades.\nThe full integration of candlestick charting has been hampered by\na tendency among many proponents to see them as an alternative.\nWhile they are a superior alternative to Western bar charts, they are\nnot a substitute for Western chart patterns.

Small bodies, tiny bodies, and Dojis should yield similar re-\nsults to Figure 10-32 if they have long tails and are in similar posi-\ntions.\nNote that the percentages used are the average of each pattern’s\naccuracy over one through seven days of follow-through, therefore\nthe percentages for comparing patterns is not supposed to add up \nto 100%.\nThe message is profound. Of these “good ones,” the venerable\nHammer pattern rests just four places off the bottom of 90 patterns\ntested, while the Hanging Man stands at number two in the accuracy\nratings. The direction of the long tail substantially influences the\nprobability of a reversal.\nThe frequency ratio also provides an interesting side note. The\nbearish reversal Hanging Man (accuracy winner), occurred 30 times\nmore often than it’s companion bearish reversal the Shooting Star.\nThe bullish reversal Hammer (accuracy loser) occurred five times\nmore often than the bullish reversal Inverted Hammer. Thus, there\nwill likely be more Hammers at support, and more Hanging Man\npatterns at resistance, but equal weighting can no longer be a given\n(see Figure 10-32). So at resistance, the more frequent Hanging Man\nis much more accurate than the Shooting Star and at support, the\nmore frequent Hammer is far less accurate than the Inverted Ham-\nmer. All that said, remember the influence of location. There are a lot\nof Hammers, and cursory observations suggest a much higher accu-\nracy at pivot points.\n\u0002 430\nChapter Ten\n",

The most common two-day reversal patterns are the Engulfing\nand Harami patterns. The Harami patterns require confirmation but\nthe Engulfing patterns do not. The shape of the two patterns suggests\nan obvious reason because the Engulfing looks more decisive than\nthe Harami. The observation is right but the reason is not as obvious\nas it looks. There is a deeper and more complex reason that only\nreveals itself with comparative reduction of the patterns.\nInside Days\nThe Harami pattern is the classic Inside Day pattern. It begins with a\nLong Day in the direction of a current price trend followed by a small\nbody inside day. The body of day two may touch either the open or\nclose of day one but not both. It can be either open or closed but the\nopposite of day one is more supportive of the pattern. The Bullish\nand Bearish Harami reduce down to a wide range of signals from a\nLong Legged Doji to a big-bodied bullish or bearish day. Unlike the\nEngulfing pattern, there are many variations to the Harami, which\nhardly makes for a cohesive or consistent message.\nExamining the two patterns together, it is clear why the Harami\nneeds confirmation; without confirmation, the Harami can send a\nwide variety of signals. Here is a look at the Bearish Harami and\nEngulfing reductions (see Figure 10-58). The Harami takes three\ndays at best to create the same signal as Engulfing creates on day two.\nThe small body on day two stops progress, but the reversal mes-\nsage may be much less probable than the Engulfing pattern.\nAdding a third day of confirmation has an interesting effect on the\nBearish Harami.

It reminds me of the saying that the person with a watch always\nknows what time it is, but the person with two watches is never sure.\nLet me say it succinctly and clearly! Candle pattern analysis should\nalways be used with other confirming techniques, such as the filter-\ning technique described in Chapter 9 and/or the techniques outlined\nby Ryan Litchfield in Chapter 10 involving support and resistance\nareas on charts.\nIt has been shown that candle pattern analysis can enhance the use\nand timing of popular technical indicators.

I have never met anyone so\ndevoted to the detailed study of a concept as he. He started using can-\ndlestick analysis many years ago. In fact, all of his charting was done by\nhand until personal computers became available.\nDuring a trip to Japan in January, 1992, I studied the candle phi-\nlosophy and interpretation with Mr. Hikita. I also maintained a log\nof our conversations, from which I have selected appropriate ques-\ntions for this interview.\nOccasional editing was done to assist in clarifying his answers,\ndefinitely not to change the meaning. It became quite obvious to me\nthat using English as a second language resulted in a completely hon-\nest and direct response; with no effort to be clever or entertaining. I\nfound this to be quite refreshing and decided that you might also.\n1. How and when did you first become interested in investing and\ntrading?\nI believe it was when I was around 31 years of age, that is over 25\nyears ago. It was, however, once terminated and I stayed out of the\nmarket for about 2 years losing money, more than enough at that time.\n\u0002 481 \u0002\n",

When did you realize that a form of technical analysis was better\nthat fundamental analysis?\nIt was when I started trading again and I was around 41 years of age,\nafter leaving the company for some reason. Beginning with candle-\nstick pattern analysis, I studied and researched all different kinds of\nJapanese analysis techniques with real trading, and was extended\nlater on the method available in the States. My starting to trade again\nwas with the policy to do so based on the technical analysis and no\nmore guesses and fundamental analysis to make a living. I am fortu-\nnately still in the business of trading.\nSpeaking of this story a little further I started subscribing to Com-\nmodities (now called Futures) and purchased many publications such\nas Commodity Trading Systems and Methods written by Kaufman\nand Wilder’s publications. My first use of a calculator was the pro-\ngrammable Texas Instruments product on Wilder’s method. Then the\nCasio’s programmable calculator for me to build in my own method,\nas I became serious. Then to make the daily analysis much easier, I\npurchased the IBM-5100 with 32K memory; it was 1977.\nIn 1979, I learned the Apple II came out on the market which has a\ngraphic capability. I then immediately purchased it by importing\ndirectly from the States. In 1980, I joined CompuTrac and attended\ntheir first TAG Conference in New Orleans. My Stock & Commodi-\nties magazine subscription started then.\n3. Did you always use candle charting for your analysis? If not,\nwhen did you start suing candle charts?\nIt was from the very beginning, as far as taking a look at the market\nin general, to know how the market is acting. The candlestick chart-\ning method is the only one available in Japan to record the history of\nthe price activity in graphic form. It is just like the bar chart in the\n\u0002 482\nAppendix A\n",

I first started trading after reading the first\nissue of Shimuzu’s book in 1965, the original of The Japanese Chart\nof Charts translated by Nicholson.\n4. Are candles used in Japan today as widely as bar charts are used\nin the United States?\nAs already mentioned, there is no other method than candlestick\ncharting to show a market record and activity in Japan. Yes, it is\nbeing used just like the bar chart in the States. The pattern recogni-\ntion is another subject within the chart analysis.\n5. Is the word candlestick a Western term? If so, what is candle\ncharting and analysis called in Japan?\nThere is generally nothing but the candlestick charting to show the\ntrend and market activity, and any other are classified as the analysis\nsince they are rather clear to know the pinpoint to take an action, like\nthe Point and Figure chart. Speaking of the chart, we generally call \nit Hi Ashi/Daily Charts, Shu Ashi/Weekly Chart, and Tsuki Ashi/\nMonthly Chart. The Japanese word for candle is roshoku.\nFor your information, Ashi means Leg or better say Foot, and the\nfoot has an inside meaning of the past record, that is probably from\nthe foot stamp that shows the past movement and activities, not only\nas a market term but in general.

This is in order to hedge\nfrom inflation, while trading the futures is to make money in the\nshort term.\nThere are other reasons. It is easier to find a pivot in the futures,\nespecially to find a pinpoint to short and I like to sell, rather than go\nlong, which has a false start often, compared to going short. Not only\nthat, but it will be only one-third of the time needed for movement to\ngain the same price difference in the case of short, compared to long.\n7. Have you found that candles work better with stocks, futures, or\ndoes it matter?\nAgain, the candle charts and candle pattern analysis should be sepa-\nrated. The candlestick is only the chart itself, but the candlestick pat-\nterns are the analysis based generally on the Sakata’s Five Law, or\nsomehow originating from it. There are two applications in the law,\none for daily and the other for a weekly chart, which has a different\ndefinition. The daily candlesticks pattern work better on the futures.\nIt is again because of speed. The futures has a short trend cycle white\nthe stocks is longer.\n8. Which candle patterns seem to work best for you? Can you list\nyour 10 favorite patterns?\nYour question is too straightforward, even though it might be scien-\ntific approach to research, so it is awfully difficult to answer it. You\nhave to understand that the candle pattern analysis is originating\nfrom man’s experience in trading, and that is a mix of market ten-\ndency with the human psychology expressed in the pattern.
