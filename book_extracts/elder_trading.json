All these years, I resisted revising my book \nbecause I trusted and liked its internal logic. I traded, traveled, wrote other books, \nand taught a few classes. Now, 21 years later, I agreed to update my most popular \nbook so that you can benefit from the new technologies as well as the lessons I’ve \nlearned.\nMy late great friend Lou Taylor, to whom this book is dedicated, used to joke: “If \nI get half a percent smarter each year, I’ll be a genius by the time I die.” Revising my \nvery first book felt like reliving my youth with the benefit of experience.\nIn planning this update, I thought of a building complex in Vienna, Austria \ncalled the Gasometer. At its core are multistory storage tanks, erected by Austrian \nbricklayers in 1927. When modern technology made huge gas cylinders obsolete, \narchitects converted them into modern apartments. They punched wide openings \nin brick walls, creating panoramic views, installed floors and elevators, and added \nglass-enclosed penthouses. I used to stay in one of them and wanted my new book to \nfollow that model of blending old craftsmanship with new technology.\nBefore you begin reading this book, ask yourself: what’s the single most important \nstep you can take to become a successful trader?\nPsychology is important. Since I was actively practicing psychiatry while writ-\ning the original Trading for a Living, its psychology part stood the test of time and I \nchanged it very little in this new edition.\nMarket analysis is very important—but remember that when we look at a chart, \nwe deal with only five pieces of data—the open, the high, the low, the close and \nvolume. Piling up masses of indicators and patterns on top of those five values only \nincreases confusion. Less is often more. If you’ve read Trading for a Living, you’ll see \nthat I’ve reduced the number of technical chapters and moved some of them into \na downloadable addendum. On the other hand, I added several new chapters that \n",

I also added a section on stops, \nprofit targets and other practical details. \nMoney management is extremely important because financial markets are hot-\nbeds of risk. That was the weakest part of the original book, and I completely \nrewrote it. One of many tools you’ll discover will be the Iron Triangle of risk \ncontrol.\nPsychology, trading tactics, and money management are the three pillars of \nsuccess, but there is the fourth factor that ties them together. That factor—which \nintegrates all others—is record-keeping.\nKeeping good records will enable you to learn from your experiences. It’ll help \nyou break out of the vicious circle of small gains and big losses, running like a squir-\nrel in a barrel, sweating and stressed but never getting anywhere. Keeping good \nrecords will make you your own teacher and a better trader. I’ll show you several \ntypes of records you need to keep and will share several of my trade diaries.\nIf you’re a new reader, welcome to the journey. If you’ve already read Trading for a \nLiving, I hope you’ll find this new book two decades smarter than the first.\nDr. ⁜Alexander Elder\nNew York–Vermont, 2014\n",

You can be indepen-\ndent from routine and not answer to anybody.\nThis is the life of a successful trader.\nMany aspire to it but few succeed. An amateur looks at a quote screen and sees \nmillions of dollars sparkle in front of his face. He reaches for the money—and loses. \nHe reaches again—and loses more. Traders lose because the game is hard, or out of \nignorance, or from lack of discipline. If any of these ail you, I wrote this book for you.\nHow I Began to Trade\nIn the summer of 1976, I drove from New York to California. I took along a few books \non psychiatry (I was a first-year psychiatric resident), several histories, and put a pa-\nperback copy of Engel’s How to Buy Stocks into the trunk of my old Dodge. Little did I \nknow that a dog-eared paperback, borrowed from a lawyer friend, would in due time \nchange the course of my life. That friend, incidentally, had a perfect reverse golden \ntouch—any investment he touched went under water. But that’s another story.\nI gulped down the Engel book in campgrounds across America, finishing it on a \nPacific beach in La Jolla. I had known nothing about the stock market, and the idea \nof making money by thinking gripped me.\nI grew up in the Soviet Union in the days when it was, in the words of a former \nU.S. president, “an evil empire.” I hated the Soviet system and wanted to get out, but \n",

Now I could break \nfree! I jumped the Soviet ship in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.\nI ran to the U.S. Embassy through the clogged dusty streets of an African port \ncity, chased by my ex-crewmates. The embassy put me in a “safe house” and then on \na plane to New York. I landed at Kennedy Airport in February 1974, arriving from \nAfrica with $25 in my pocket. I spoke some English, but did not know a soul in this \ncountry.\nI had no idea what stocks, bonds, futures, or options were and sometimes got a \nqueasy feeling just from looking at the American dollar bills in my wallet. In the old \ncountry, a handful of them could buy you three years in Siberia.\nReading How to Buy Stocks opened a whole new world for me. When I returned \nto New York, I bought my first stock—it was KinderCare. A very bad thing hap-\npened—I made money on my first trade and then the second one, leaving me with \na delusion that making money in the markets was easy. It took me a couple of years \nto get rid of that notion.\nMy professional career proceeded on a separate track. I completed a residency in \npsychiatry at a major university hospital, studied at the New York Psychoanalytic In-\nstitute, and served as book editor for the largest psychiatric newspaper in the United \nStates. I still have my license, but my professional practice these days is at most an hour \nor two per month. I am busy trading, love traveling, and do some teaching.\nLearning to trade has been a long journey—with soaring highs and aching lows. \nIn moving forward—or in circles—I repeatedly knocked my head against the wall \nand ran my trading account into the ground. Each time I returned to a hospital job, \nput a stake together, read, thought, did more testing, and then started trading again.\nMy trading slowly improved, but the breakthrough came when I realized that the \nkey to winning was inside my head and not inside a computer. Psychiatry gave me \nthe insight into trading that I will share with you.\nDo You Really Want to Succeed?\nFor many years I had a friend whose wife was fat. She was an elegant dresser, and \nshe had been on a diet for as long as I had known her. She said she wanted to lose \nweight and she didn’t eat cake or potatoes in front of people—but when I came into \nher kitchen, I’d see her go at it with a big fork. She said she wanted to be slim, but \nremained fat.\nThe short-term pleasure of eating was stronger for her than the delayed pleasure \nand health benefits of weight loss. My friend’s wife reminded me of a great many \ntraders who say they want to be successful but keep making impulsive trades—going \nfor the short-term thrills of gambling in the markets.\nPeople deceive and play games with themselves. Lying to others is bad, but lying \nto yourself is hopeless. Bookstores are full of good books on dieting, but the world \nis still full of overweight people.\n",

      "text": "2. PSYCHOLOGY IS THE KEY\t\n3\nThis book will teach you how to analyze and trade the markets, control risks, and \ndeal with your own mind. I can give you the knowledge. Only you can supply the \nmotivation.\nAnd remember this: an athlete who wants to enjoy risky sports must follow safety \nrules. When you reduce risks, you gain an added sense of accomplishment and con-\ntrol. The same goes for trading.\nYou can succeed in trading only if you handle it as a serious intellectual pursuit. Emotional \ntrading is lethal. To help ensure success, practice defensive money management. A good trader \nwatches his capital as carefully as a professional scuba diver watches his air supply.\n■\n■2. Psychology Is the Key\nRemember how you felt the last time you placed an order? Were you anxious to \njump in or afraid of losing? Did you procrastinate before entering your order? When \nyou closed out a trade, did you feel elated or humiliated? The feelings of thousands \nof traders merge into huge psychological tides that move the markets.\nGetting Off the Roller Coaster\nThe majority of traders spend most of their time looking for good trades. Once \nthey enter a trade, they don’t manage it but either squirm from pain or grin from \npleasure. They ride an emotional roller coaster and miss the essential element of \nwinning—the management of their emotions. Their inability to manage themselves \nleads to poor risk management and losses.\nIf your mind is not in gear with the markets, or if you ignore changes in mass \npsychology of crowds, you have no chance of making money trading. All winning \nprofessionals know the enormous importance of psychology. Most losing amateurs \nignore it.\nFriends and students who know that I am a psychiatrist often ask whether this \nhelps me as a trader. Good psychiatry and good trading have one important principle \nin common. Both focus on reality, on seeing the world the way it is. To live a healthy \nlife, you have to live with your eyes open. To be a good trader, you need to trade with \nyour eyes open, recognize real trends and turns, and not waste time or energy on \nfantasies, regrets, and wishful thinking.\nA Man’s Game?\nBrokerage house records indicate that most traders are male. The files of my firm, \nElder.com, confirm that approximately 85 to 90 percent of traders are male. The \npercentage of women traders among my clients, however, has more than doubled \nsince the original edition of Trading for a Living was written twenty years ago.\n",

      "text": "4\t\nINTRODUCTION\nThe English language being what it is, “he” flows better than “he or she” or jump-\ning between the two pronouns. To make reading easier, I’ll use the masculine pro-\nnoun throughout this book. Of course, no disrespect is intended to the many wom-\nen traders.\nAs a matter of fact, I find that the percentage of successful traders is higher among \nwomen. As a group, they tend to be more disciplined and less arrogant than men.\nHow This Book Is Organized\nThe three pillars of successful trading are psychology, market analysis, and risk man-\nagement. Good record-keeping ties them together. This book will help you learn the \nessentials of all these areas.\nPart One of this book will show you how to manage emotions in trading. I discov-\nered this method while practicing psychiatry. It greatly improved my trading, and it \ncan help you too.\nPart Two will focus on crowd psychology of the markets. Mass behavior is more \nprimitive than that of individuals. If you understand how crowds behave, you’ll be \nable to profit from their mood swings instead of being swept up in their emotional \ntides.\nPart Three will show how chart patterns reflect crowd behavior. Classical techni-\ncal analysis is applied social psychology, like poll-taking. Support, resistance, break-\nouts, and other patterns reflect crowd behavior.\nPart Four will teach you modern methods of computerized technical analysis. \nIndicators provide a better insight into mass psychology than classical chart patterns. \nTrend-following indicators help identify market trends, while oscillators show when \nthose trends are ready to reverse.\nVolume and open interest also reflect crowd behavior. Part Five will focus on \nthem as well as on the passage of time in the markets. Crowds have short attention \nspans, and a trader who relates price changes to time gains a competitive advantage.\nPart Six will focus on the best tools for analyzing the stock market as a whole. \nThey can be especially helpful for stock index futures and options traders.\nPart Seven will present several trading systems. We’ll begin with the Triple Screen, \nwhich has become widely accepted, and then review the Impulse and Channel trad-\ning systems.\nPart Eight will discuss several classes of trading vehicles. It will outline pluses and \nminuses of equities, futures, options, and forex, while blowing away the promotional \nfog that clouds some of these markets.\nPart Nine will lead you into the all-important topic of money management. This \nessential aspect of successful trading is neglected by most amateurs. You can have a \nbrilliant trading system, but if your risk management is poor, then a short string of \nlosses will destroy your account. Armed with the Iron Triangle of risk control and \nother tools, you’ll become a safer and more effective trader.\nPart Ten will delve into the nitty-gritty of trading—setting stops, profit targets, \nand scanning. These practical details will help you implement any system you like.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

The quality of your records is the single best predictor of your success. I’ll \noffer you free downloads of the templates I like to use.\nLast but not least, this book has a separate Study Guide. It asks over 100 questions, \neach linked to a specific section of the book. All questions are designed to test your \nlevel of understanding and discover any blind spots. After you finish reading each sec-\ntion of this book, it’ll make sense to turn to the Study Guide and answer questions \nrelevant to that section. If test results turn out to be less than excellent, don’t hurry, \nreread that section of the book, and retake the test.\nYou are about to spend many hours with this book. When you find ideas that \nlook important to you, test them in the only way that matters—on your own mar-\nket data and in your own trading. You will make this knowledge your own only by \nquestioning and testing it.\n■\n■3. The Odds against You\nWhy do most traders lose and wash out of the markets? Emotional and mindless \ntrading are big reasons, but there is another. Markets are actually set up so that most \ntraders must lose money. The trading industry slowly kills traders with commissions \nand slippage.\nYou pay commissions for entering and exiting trades. Slippage is the difference \nbetween the price at which you place your order and the price at which it gets filled. \nWhen you place a limit order, it is filled at your price or better, or not at all. When \nyou feel eager to enter or exit and place a market order, it’s often filled at a worse \nprice than prevailed when you placed it.\nMost amateurs are unaware of the harm done by commissions and slippage, just \nas medieval peasants could not imagine that tiny invisible germs could kill them. If \nyou ignore slippage and deal with a broker who charges high commissions, you’re \nacting like a peasant who drinks from a communal pool during a cholera epidemic.\nThe trading industry keeps draining huge amounts of money from the markets. \nExchanges, regulators, brokers, and advisors live off the markets, while generations \nof traders keep washing out. Markets need a fresh supply of losers just as builders \nof the ancient pyramids needed a fresh supply of slaves. Losers bring money into the \nmarkets, which is necessary for the prosperity of the trading industry.\nA Minus-Sum Game\nWinners in a zero-sum game make as much as losers lose. If you and I bet $20 on \nthe direction of the next 100-point move in the Dow, one of us will collect $20 and \nthe other will lose $20. A single bet has a component of luck, but the more knowl-\nedgeable person will keep winning more often than losing over a period of time.\nPeople buy the industry’s propaganda about trading being a zero-sum game, take \nthe bait, and open accounts. They don’t realize that trading is a minus-sum game. \n",

      "text": "5. REALITY VERSUS FANTASY\t\n11\nIn talking to hundreds of traders, I keep hearing several universal fantasies. They \ndistort reality and stand in the way of trading success. A successful trader must iden-\ntify his fantasies and get rid of them.\nThe Brain Myth\nLosers who suffer from the “brain myth” will tell you, “I lost because I didn’t know \ntrading secrets.” Many have a fantasy that successful traders have some secret knowl-\nedge. That fantasy helps support a lively market in advisory services and ready-made \ntrading systems.\nA demoralized trader may whip out his credit card to buy access to “trading \nsecrets.” He may send money to a charlatan for a $3,000 “can’t miss,” backtested, \ncomputerized trading system. When that system self-destructs, he’ll pull out his \nalmost-maxed-out credit card again for a “scientific manual” that explains how he \ncan stop losing and begin winning by contemplating the moon, the stars, or even \nUranus.\nAt an investment club we used to have in New York, I often ran into a famous \nfinancial astrologer. He often asked for free admission because he couldn’t afford to \npay a modest fee for the meeting and a meal. His main source of income remains \ncollecting money for astrological trading predictions from hopeful amateurs. \nLosers don’t realize that trading is intellectually fairly simple. It is nowhere near \nas demanding as taking out an appendix, building a bridge, or trying a case in court. \nGood traders are shrewd, but few are intellectuals. Many have never been to college, \nand some have dropped out of high school.\nIntelligent and hardworking people who have succeeded in their careers often feel \ndrawn to trading.\nWhy do they fail so often? What separates winners from losers isn’t intelligence \nor secrets, and certainly not education.\nThe Undercapitalization Myth\nMany losers think that they would trade successfully if they had a bigger account.\nPeople destroy their accounts either by a string of losses or a single abysmally bad \ntrade. Often, after the loser is sold out, unable to meet a margin call, the market \nreverses and moves in the direction he expected. He starts fuming: had he survived \nanother week, he would have made a fortune instead of losing!\nSuch people look at market reversals that come too late and think that those turns \nconfirm their methods. They may go back to work and earn, save, or borrow enough \nmoney to open another small account. History repeats itself: The loser gets wiped \nout, the market reverses and “proves” him right, but only too late—he’s been sold \nout again. That’s when the fantasy is born: “If only I had a bigger account, I could have \nstayed in the market longer and won.”\nSome losers raise money from relatives and friends by showing them a paper track \nrecord. It seems to prove that they would have won big, if only they had had more \n",

But even if they raise more money, they lose that, too—as if \nthe market were laughing at them!\nA loser is not undercapitalized—his mind is underdeveloped. A loser can destroy \na big account almost as quickly as a small one. An acquaintance of mine once blew \nout over 200 million dollars in a day. His broker sold him out—and then the market \nturned. He sued the broker and said to me: “If only I had a bigger account….” Ap-\nparently an account with $200 million wasn’t big enough.\nA loser’s true problem is not account size but overtrading and sloppy money manage-\nment. He takes risks that are too big for his account size, however small or big. No mat-\nter how good his system may be, a streak of bad trades is sure to put him out of business.\nAmateurs neither expect to lose nor are prepared to manage losing trades. Calling \nthemselves undercapitalized is a cop-out that helps them avoid two painful truths: \ntheir lack of a realistic money management plan and lack of discipline.\nA trader who wants to survive and prosper must control losses. You do that by \nrisking only a tiny fraction of your equity on any single trade (see Section Nine, “Risk \nManagement”). Learn from cheap mistakes in a small account.\nThe one advantage of a large trading account is that the price of equipment and \nservices represents a smaller percentage of your money. The owner of a million-\ndollar fund who spends $5,000 on classes is only ½ percent behind the game. The \nsame expenditure would represent a deadly 25 percent of equity for a trader with a \n$20,000 account.\nThe Autopilot Myth\nTraders who believe in the autopilot myth think that the pursuit of wealth can be \nautomated. Some people try to develop an automatic trading system, while others \nbuy systems from vendors. Men who have spent years honing their skills as lawyers, \ndoctors, or businessmen plunk down thousands of dollars for canned competence. \nMost are driven by greed, laziness, and mathematical illiteracy.\nSystems used to be written on sheets of paper, but now they get downloaded on \na computer. Some are primitive; others are elaborate, with built-in optimization and \neven money management rules. Many traders spend thousands of dollars searching \nfor magic that will turn a few pages of computer code into an endless stream of \nmoney. People who pay for automatic trading systems are like medieval knights who \npaid alchemists for the secret of turning base metals into gold.\nComplex human activities do not lend themselves to automation. Computerized \nlearning systems have not replaced teachers, and programs for doing taxes haven’t \ncreated unemployment among accountants. Most human activities call for an exer-\ncise of judgment; machines and systems can help but not replace humans.\nHad there been a successful automatic trading system, its purchaser could move \nto Tahiti and spend the rest of his life at leisure, supported by a stream of checks from \nhis broker. So far, the only people who’ve made money from trading systems are their \nsellers. They form a small but colorful cottage industry. If their systems worked, \nwhy would they sell them? They could move to Tahiti themselves and cash checks \nfrom their brokers! Meanwhile, every system seller has a line. Some say they like \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Others claim that they sell their systems only to \nraise capital or even out of love for humanity.\nMarkets are always changing and defeating automatic trading systems. Yesterday’s \nrigid rules will work less well today and will probably stop working tomorrow. A \ncompetent trader can adjust his methods when he detects trouble. An automatic \nsystem is less adaptable and self-destructs.\nAirlines pay high salaries to pilots despite having autopilots. They do it because \nhumans can handle unforeseen events. When a roof blows off an airliner over the \nPacific or when a passenger jet loses both engines to a flock of geese over Manhat-\ntan, only a human can handle such crises. These emergencies have been reported in \nthe press, and in each of them, experienced pilots managed to land their airliners by \nimprovising solutions. No autopilot can do that. Betting your money on an automatic \nsystem is like betting your life on an autopilot. The first unexpected event will make \nyour account crash and burn.\nThere are good trading systems out there, but they have to be monitored and ad-\njusted using individual judgment. You have to stay on the ball—you cannot abdicate \nresponsibility for your success to a mechanical system.\nTraders with autopilot fantasies try to repeat what they felt as infants. Their \nmothers used to fulfill their needs for food, warmth, and comfort. Now they try to \nrecreate the experience of passively lying on their backs and having profits flow to \nthem like an endless stream of free, warm milk. The market is not your mother. It \nconsists of tough men and women who look for ways to take money from you rather \nthan pouring warm milk into your mouth.\nThe Cult of Personality\nMost people pay lip service to their wish for freedom and independence, but when \nthey come under pressure, they change their tune and start looking for “strong lead-\nership.”  Traders in distress often seek directions from assorted gurus.\nWhen I was growing up in the former Soviet Union, children were taught that \nStalin was our great leader. Later we found out what a monster he was, but while he \nwas alive, most people enjoyed following the leader. He freed them from the need \nto think for themselves.\n“Little Stalins” were installed in every area of society—in economics, biology, \narchitecture, and so on. When I came to the United States and began to trade, I was \namazed to see how many traders were looking for a guru—their own “little Stalin.” \nThe fantasy that someone else can make you rich is always with us.\nThere are three types of gurus in the financial markets: market cycle gurus, magic \nmethod gurus, and dead gurus. Cycle gurus call important market turns. Method \ngurus promote new highways to riches. Still others have escaped criticism and in-\nvited cult following through the simple mechanism of departing this world.\nMarket Cycle Gurus\nFor many decades, the U.S. stock market has generally followed a four-year cycle. \nThe broad stock market has normally spent 2.5 or 3 years going up and 1 or 1.5 years \n",

The reigning period \nof each guru coincides with a major bull market in the United States.\nA market cycle guru forecasts rallies and declines. Each correct forecast increases \nhis fame and prompts even more people to buy or sell when he issues his pronounce-\nments. A market cycle guru has a pet theory about the market. That theory—cycles, \nvolume, Elliott Wave, whatever—is usually developed several years prior to reaching \nstardom. At first, the market refuses to follow an aspiring guru’s pet theory. Then \nthe market changes and for several years comes in gear with the guru’s calls. That is \nwhen the guru’s star rises high above the marketplace.\nCompare this to what happens to fashion models as public tastes change. One year, \nblondes are popular, another year, redheads. Suddenly, last year’s blonde star is no lon-\nger wanted for the front cover of a major magazine. Everybody wants a dark model, \nor a woman with a birthmark on her face. A model doesn’t change—public tastes do.\nGurus always come from the fringes of market analysis. They are never establish-\nment analysts. Institutional employees play it safe—afraid to stick their necks out—\nand almost never achieve spectacular results. A market cycle guru is an outsider with \na unique theory.\nA guru remains famous for as long as the market behaves according to his the–\nory—usually for less than the duration of one 4-year market cycle. At some point, \nthe market changes and starts marching to a different tune. A guru continues to use \nold methods that worked so well in the past and loses his following. When the guru’s \nforecasts stop working, public admiration turns to hatred. It’s impossible for a dis-\ncredited market cycle guru to return to stardom.\nAll market cycle gurus have several traits in common. They become active in \nthe forecasting business several years prior to reaching stardom. Each has a unique \ntheory, a few followers, and some credibility, conferred by sheer survival in the ad-\nvisory business. The fact that each guru’s theory did not work for a number of years \nis ignored by his followers. When the theory becomes correct, the mass media take \nnotice. When a theory stops working, mass adulation turns to hatred.\nWhen you recognize that a successful new guru is emerging, it may be profitable \nto jump on his bandwagon. It’s even more important to recognize when a guru has \nreached his peak. All gurus crash—and by definition, they crash from the height of \ntheir fame. When a guru becomes accepted by the mass media, it’s a good sign that \nhe has reached his crest. The mainstream media is wary of outsiders. When several \nmass magazines devote space to a hot market guru, you know that his end is near. \nMass psychology being what it is, new gurus will continue to emerge. \nMagic Method Gurus\nWhile cycle gurus are creatures of the stock market, “method gurus” are more \nprominent in the derivatives markets. A “method guru” erupts on the financial scene \nafter discovering a new analytic or trading method.\nTraders always look for an edge, an advantage over fellow traders. Like knights \nshopping for swords, they are willing to pay handsomely for their trading tools. No \nprice is too high if it lets them tap into a money pipeline.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

      "text": "5. REALITY VERSUS FANTASY\t\n15\nA magic method guru sells a new set of keys to market profits—speedlines, cy-\ncles, Market Profile, etc. It may have an edge in the beginning, but as soon as enough \npeople become familiar with a new method and test it in the markets, it inevitably \ndeteriorates and starts losing popularity. Markets are forever grinding down each \nmethod’s edge, and what worked yesterday is less likely to work today and highly \nunlikely a year from now.\nOddly enough, even in this era of global communications, reputations change \nslowly. A guru whose image has been destroyed in his own country can make money \npeddling his theory overseas. That point has been made to me by a guru who com-\npared his continued popularity in Asia to what happens to faded American singers \nand movie stars. They are unable to attract an audience in the United States, but they \ncan still make a living singing abroad.\nDead Gurus\nThe third type of a market guru is a dead guru. His books are reissued, his market \ncourses are scrutinized by new generations of eager traders, and the legend of the \ndear-departed analyst’s prowess and personal wealth grows posthumously. The dead \nguru is no longer among us and cannot capitalize on his fame. Other promoters profit \nfrom his reputation and expired copyrights. One dear-departed guru is R. N. Elliott, \nbut the best example of such a legend is W. D. Gann.\nVarious opportunists sell “Gann courses” and “Gann software.” They claim that \nGann was one of the best traders who ever lived, that he left a $50 million estate, \nand so on. I interviewed W. D. Gann’s son, an analyst for a Boston bank. He told me \nthat his famous father could not support his family by trading but earned his living by \nwriting and selling instructional courses. He could not afford a secretary and made \nhis son work for him. When W. D. Gann died in the 1950s, his estate, including his \nhouse, was valued at slightly over $100,000. The legend of W. D. Gann, the giant of \ntrading, is perpetuated by those who sell courses and other paraphernalia to gullible \ncustomers.\nThe Followers of Gurus\nA guru has to produce original research for several years, then get lucky when the \nmarket turns his way. While some gurus are dead, those who are alive range from \nserious academic types to great showmen. To read about scandals surrounding many \ngurus, try Winner Takes All by William R. Gallacher.\nWhen we pay a guru, we expect to get back more than we spend. We act like a \nman who bets a few dollars against a three-card Monte dealer on a street corner. He \nhopes to win more than he put down on an overturned crate. Only the ignorant or \ngreedy take the bait.\nSome people turn to gurus in search of a strong leader. They look for a parent-like \nomniscient provider. As a friend once said, “They walk with their umbilical cords in \nhand, looking for a place to plug them in.” A smart promoter provides such a recep-\ntacle, for a fee.\nThe public wants gurus, and new gurus will come. As an intelligent trader, you must realize \nthat in the long run, no guru is going to make you rich.  You have to work on that yourself.\n",

A guru \nis someone claiming to lead the crowds across the desert for a donation. No such \npitches here!\nI always begin by explaining that there are no magic methods, that the field of \ntrading is as huge and diverse as that of medicine, where one needs to choose one \nspecialty and work hard to become good at it. I chose my path a long time ago, and \nwhat I do in front of a class is simply think out loud, sharing my modes of research \nand decision making.\nTrade with Your Eyes Open\nWishful thinking is stronger than dollars. Recent research has proven that people \nhave a prodigious ability to lie to themselves and avoid seeing the truth.\nDuke University professor Dan Ariely describes a clever experiment. A group of \npeople are given an intelligence test, but half of them are “accidentally” shown a re-\nsponse sheet, allowing them to look up correct answers before recording their own. \nNeedless to say, they score above the rest. Next, everybody is asked to predict their \ngrades on the next IQ test, in which there will be absolutely no cheat sheets—and \nthose who predict correctly will get paid. Surprisingly, the half of the group that \nscored higher with cheat sheets predicted higher results for the next test. The cheat-\ners wanted to believe they were very smart, even though their incorrect predictions \nof success would cost them money.\nA successful trader cannot afford wishful thinking—he must be a realist. There \nare no cheat sheets in the markets—you can see the truth in your trade diaries and \nequity curves.\nTo win in the markets, we need to master three essential components of trading: \nsound psychology, a logical trading system, and an effective risk management plan. \nThese are like three legs of a stool—remove one and the stool will fall. It is a typical \nbeginner mistake to focus exclusively on indicators and trading systems.\nYou have to analyze your feelings as you trade to make sure that your decisions are sound. \nYour trades must be based on clearly defined rules.  You have to structure your money manage-\nment so that no string of losses can kick you out of the game.\n■\n■6. Self-Destructiveness\nTrading is a very hard game. A trader who wants to win and remain successful in the \nlong run has to be extremely serious about his craft. He cannot afford to be naive or \nto trade because of some hidden psychological agenda.\nUnfortunately, trading often appeals to impulsive people, gamblers, and those \nwho feel that the world owes them a living. If you trade for the excitement, you’ll \ninevitably take trades with bad odds and accept needless risks. The markets are un-\nforgiving, and emotional trading always results in losses.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

      "text": "6. SELF-DESTRUCTIVENESS\t\n17\nGambling\nGambling means betting on games of chance or skill. It exists in all societies, and \nmost people have gambled at some point in their lives.\nFreud believed that gambling was universally attractive because it was a substitute \nfor masturbation. The repetitive and exciting activity of the hands, the irresistible \nurge, the resolutions to stop, the intoxicating quality of pleasure, and the feelings of \nguilt link gambling and masturbation.\nDr. Ralph Greenson, a prominent California psychoanalyst, has divided gamblers \ninto three groups: the normal person who gambles for diversion and who can stop \nwhen he wishes; the professional gambler, who selects gambling as his means of \nearning a livelihood; and the neurotic gambler, who gambles because he is driven by \nunconscious needs and is unable to stop.\nA neurotic gambler either feels lucky or wants to test his luck. Winning gives \nhim a sense of power. He feels pleased, like a baby feeding at a breast. In the end, a \nneurotic gambler always loses because he tries to recreate that omnipotent feeling of \nbliss instead of concentrating on a realistic long-term game plan.\nDr. Sheila Blume, director of the compulsive gambling program at South Oaks \nHospital in New York, called gambling “an addiction without a drug.” Most gamblers \nare men who gamble for the action. Women tend to gamble as a means of escape. \nLosers usually hide their losses and try to look and act like winners, but are plagued \nby self-doubt.\nTrading stocks, futures, and options gives a gambler a high, while looking more \nrespectable than betting on the ponies. Gambling in the financial markets has a greater \naura of sophistication than playing numbers with a bookie.\nGamblers feel happy when trades go in their favor. They feel terribly low when \nthey lose. They differ from successful professionals who focus on long-term plans \nand don’t get particularly upset or excited over any single trade.\nThe key sign of gambling is the inability to resist the urge to bet. If you feel that you are \ntrading too much and the results are poor, stop trading for a month. This will give you a chance \nto re-evaluate your trading. If the urge to trade is so strong that you cannot stay away from the \naction for a month, then it is time to visit your local chapter of Gamblers Anonymous or start \nusing the principles of Alcoholics Anonymous, outlined later in this chapter.\nSelf-Sabotage\nAfter practicing psychiatry for decades, I became convinced that most failures in life \nare due to self-sabotage. We fail in our professional, personal, and business affairs \nnot because of bad luck or incompetence, but to fulfill an unconscious wish to fail.\nA brilliant friend of mine had a lifelong history of demolishing his success. As a \nyoung man, he was a successful pharmacist but lost his business; became a broker and \nrose near the top of his firm but was sued; turned to trading but busted out while \ndisentangling himself from previous disasters. He blamed all his failures on envious \nbosses, incompetent regulators, and an unsupportive wife.\n",

The trading highway is littered with wrecks. \nTrading is the most dangerous human endeavor, short of war.\nControlling Self-Destructiveness\nMost people go through life making the same mistakes decade after decade. Some \nstructure their lives to succeed in one area, while acting out their internal conflicts \nin another.\nYou need to be aware of your tendency to sabotage yourself. Stop blaming your losses on bad \nluck or on others, and take responsibility for your results. Start keeping a diary—a record of all \nyour trades, with reasons for entering and exiting them. Look for repetitive patterns of success \nand failure. Those who don’t learn from the past are condemned to repeat it.\nA trader needs a psychological safety net the way a mountain climber needs his \nsurvival gear. I found the principles of Alcoholics Anonymous, outlined below, to \nbe of great help at an early stage of trader development. Strict money management \nrules also provide a safety net, while the diary helps you learn from your mistakes as \nwell as successes.\n■\n■7. Trading Psychology\nYour success or failure as a trader depends on your emotions. You may have a brilliant \ntrading system, but if you feel arrogant, frightened, or upset, your account is sure \nto suffer. If you become aware of fear, greed, or a gambler’s high, close your trades.\nIn trading, you compete against the sharpest minds in the world. Commissions \nand slippage slant the field against you. Now, on top of that, if you allow your emo-\ntions to interfere with your trading, the battle is lost. My friend and partner in \nSpikeTrade.com Kerry Lovvorn is fond of repeating: “It is hard enough to know what \nthe market is going to do; if you don’t know what you are going to do, the game is lost.”\nHaving a good trading system is not enough. Many traders with good systems \nwash out because psychologically they are not prepared to win.\nBending the Rules\nMarkets offer enormous temptations, like walking through a gold vault or through a \nharem. They provoke great surges of greed and even greater waves of fear of losing \nwhat we’ve got. Those feelings cloud our perceptions of market reality.\nMost amateurs feel like geniuses after a short winning streak. It is exciting to \nbelieve that you are so good that all your trades are sure to be winners. That’s when \ntraders start deviating from their rules and damage their accounts.\nTraders gain some knowledge, win, their emotions kick in, and they self-destruct. \nMost traders promptly give their “killings” back to the markets, which are full of \nrags to riches to rags stories. The hallmark of a successful trader is the ability to ac-\ncumulate equity.\n",

Keep a spreadsheet listing all your trades, including commissions and \nslippage. Keep a diary of all your trades with “before and after” charts. At the early \nstages of your trading career, you may have to devote as much energy to analyzing \nyourself as analyzing the markets.\nWhen I was learning to trade, I read every book on trading psychology I could \nfind. Many writers offered sensible advice. Some stressed discipline: “You cannot let \nthe markets sway you. Don’t make decisions during trading hours. Plan a trade, and \ntrade a plan.” Others stressed flexibility: “Don’t enter the market with any precon-\nceived notions. Change your plans when markets change.” Some experts suggested \nisolation—no business news, no Wall Street Journal, no listening to other traders, just \nyou and the market. Others advised being open-minded, keeping in touch with other \ntraders, and soaking up fresh ideas. Each piece of advice seemed to make sense, but \nthey contradicted one another.\nI kept reading, trading, and focusing on system development. I also continued to \npractice psychiatry. I never thought the two fields were connected—until I had a \nsudden insight. The idea that changed how I trade came from psychiatry.\nThe Insight That Changed My Trading\nLike most psychiatrists, I always had some patients with alcohol problems. I also \nserved as a consultant to a major drug rehabilitation program. It didn’t take me long \nto realize that alcoholics and addicts were more likely to recover in self-help groups \nthan in classical psychiatric settings.\nPsychotherapy, medications, and expensive hospitals and clinics can sober up a \ndrunk but seldom succeed in helping him remain sober. Most addicts quickly re-\nlapse. They have a much better chance to recover if they become active in Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) and similar self-help groups.\nOnce I realized that AA members were more likely to stay sober and rebuild \ntheir lives, I became a big fan of Alcoholics Anonymous. I began sending patients \nwith drinking problems to AA and related groups, such as ACOA (Adult Children of \nAlcoholics). If an alcoholic came to me for treatment, I insisted that he also go to AA \nbecause otherwise he’d be wasting both our time and his money.\nOne night I stopped by a friend’s office on the way to a party. We had two hours \nbefore it began, and my friend, who was a recovering alcoholic, said: “Do you want \nto take in a movie or go to an AA meeting?” I had sent many patients to AA but had \nnever been to a meeting, since I have never had a drinking problem. I jumped at a \nchance to attend an AA meeting—it was a new experience.\nThe meeting was held at a local YMCA. A dozen men and a few women sat on \nfolding chairs in a plain room. The meeting lasted an hour. I was amazed by what I \nheard—these people seemed to talk about my trading!\nThey talked about alcohol, but as long as I substituted the word “loss” for “alco-\nhol,” most of what they said applied to me! My account equity was swinging up and \ndown in those days. I left that meeting knowing that I had to handle my losses the \nway AA handles alcoholism.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

You hit rock bottom when the market comes roaring at you and yells: “You fool!”\nSome people hit rock bottom after only a few weeks of trading. Others keep add-\ning money to their accounts to postpone the day of reckoning. It hurts to see a loser \nin the mirror. We spend our lifetime building up self-esteem. Most of us have a high \nopinion of ourselves. Your first impulse may be to hide, but remember, you are not \nalone. Almost every trader has been there.\nMany traders who hit rock bottom slink away from the market and never look \nback. Many who trade today will be gone in a year, if not sooner. They’ll hit rock \nbottom, crumble, and leave. They’ll try to forget trading like a bad dream.\nSome will lick their wounds and wait until the pain fades away and then return, \nhaving learned little. They’ll be fearful, and their fear will further impair their trading.\nFortunately, some traders will recoil from rock bottom to begin the process of \nchange and growth. For these individuals, the pain of hitting rock bottom will break \nthe vicious cycle of getting high from winning and then losing everything and crash-\ning. When you admit that your personal problem causes you to lose, you can begin building a \nnew trading life.  You can start developing the discipline of a winner.\nTrader’s First Step\nJust as an alcoholic needs to admit that he can’t control his drinking, a trader needs \nto admit that he cannot control his losses. The first step of an AA member is to say: “I \nam an alcoholic, I am powerless over alcohol.” As a trader, you have to take your first \nstep and say: “I am a loser, I am powerless over losses.”\nRecovering alcoholics struggle to stay sober, one day at a time. A trader can re-\ncover, using the principles of AA. Now you have to struggle to trade without losses, \none day at a time.\nYou may say that’s impossible. What if you buy, and the market immediately de-\nclines? What if you sell short, and it turns out to be the bottom tick, and the market \nimmediately rallies? Even the best traders lose money on some trades.\nThe answer is to draw a line between a businessman’s risk and a loss. As traders, \nwe always take businessman’s risks, but we may never take a loss greater than this \npredetermined risk.\nFor example, a storekeeper takes a risk every time he stocks new merchandise. \nIf it doesn’t sell, he’ll lose money. An intelligent businessman takes only risks that \nwill not put him out of business, even if he makes several mistakes in a row. Stocking \ntwo crates of merchandise may be a sensible business risk, but stocking a full trailer \nis probably a gamble.\nAs a trader, you are in the business of trading. You need to define your business-\nman’s risk—the maximum amount of money you’ll risk on any single trade. There \nis no standard dollar amount, just as there is no standard business. An acceptable \nbusinessman’s risk depends, first of all, on the size of your trading account. It also \ndepends on your trading method and pain tolerance.\n",

      "text": "26\t\nINDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY\nThe concept of a businessman’s risk will change the way you manage your money \n(see Section 9, “Risk Management”). The absolute maximum a trader may risk on any \ntrade is two percent of his account equity. For example, if you have $30,000 in your \naccount, you may not risk more than $600 per trade, and if you have $10,000, you \nmay not risk more than $200. If your account is small, limit yourself to trading fewer \nshares, less expensive futures, or mini-contracts. If you see an attractive trade, but a \nlogical stop would have to be placed where more than 2 percent of equity would be \nat risk—pass on that trade. You may risk less, but you may never risk more. You must \navoid risking more than 2 percent on a trade the way a recovering alcoholic avoids bars.\nA trader who blames high commissions on a broker and slippage on a floor trader \ngives up control of his trading life. Try to reduce both, but take responsibility for \nthem. If you lose even a dollar more than your businessman’s risk, including com-\nmissions and slippage, you are a loser.\nDo you keep good trading records? Poor record-keeping is a sure sign of a gam-\nbler. Good businessmen keep good records. Your trading records must show the date \nand price of every entry and exit, slippage, commissions, stops, all adjustments of \nstops, reasons for entering, objectives for exiting, maximum paper profit, maximum \npaper loss after a stop was hit, and any other data necessary to review and fully un-\nderstand your trade later in the future.\nIf you bail out of a trade within your businessman’s risk, it is normal business. \nThere is no bargaining, no waiting for another tick, no hoping for a change. Losing \na dollar more than your established businessman’s risk is like getting drunk, getting \ninto a brawl, getting sick to your stomach on your way home, and waking up in a \ngutter. You would never want that to happen.\nA Meeting for One\nWhen you go to an AA meeting, you’ll see people who have not had a drink in years \nstand up and say: “Hello, my name is so-and-so, and I am an alcoholic.” Why do they \ncall themselves alcoholics after years of sobriety? Because if they think they have \nbeaten alcoholism, they will start drinking again. If a person stops thinking he is an \nalcoholic, he is free to take a drink, then another, and will probably end up in the gut-\nter again. A person who wants to stay sober must remember that he is an alcoholic \nfor the rest of his life.\nTraders would benefit from our own self-help organization—I’d call it Losers \nAnonymous. Why not Traders Anonymous? Because a harsh name helps focus atten-\ntion on our self-destructive tendencies. After all, Alcoholics Anonymous doesn’t call \nitself Drinkers Anonymous. As long as you call yourself a loser, you’ll focus on avoid-\ning losses.\nSeveral traders have argued against what they thought was the “negative thinking” \nof Losers Anonymous. A retired woman from Texas, a highly successful trader, de-\nscribed her approach. She is very religious, prays every morning, and then drives to \nan office where she actively trades.

WINNERS AND LOSERS\t\n29\nwho makes his living at the track does not get excited, yell, or bet the bulk of his roll \non a single race, or even in a single day.1\nCasinos love drunks. They pour gamblers free drinks to make them more emo-\ntional and gamble more. Casinos also throw out calm and intelligent card-counters. \nThere is less free liquor on Wall Street than in a casino, but at least here, they do not \nthrow you out for being a good trader.\nIn Charge of Your Life\nWhen a monkey hurts its foot on a tree stump, he flies into a rage and kicks the \npiece of wood. You laugh at a monkey, but do you laugh at yourself when you act \nlike him? If the market drops while you are long, you may double up on your losing \ntrade or else flip and go short, trying to get even. This is acting emotionally instead \nof using your intellect. What’s the difference between a trader trying to get back at \nthe market and a monkey kicking a tree stump? Acting out of anger, fear, or elation \ndestroys the chance of success. You have to analyze your behavior instead of acting \nout your feelings.\nWe get angry at the market; we become afraid of it and develop silly superstitions. \nAll the while, the market keeps cycling through its rallies and declines like an ocean \ngoing through its storms and calm periods. Mark Douglas writes in The Disciplined \nTrader that in the market, “There is no beginning, middle, or end—only what you \ncreate in your own mind. Rarely do any of us grow up learning to operate in an arena \nthat allows for complete freedom of creative expression, with no external structure \nto restrict it in any way.”\nWe try to cajole or manipulate the market, acting like the ancient emperor Xerxes, \nwho ordered his soldiers to horsewhip the sea for sinking his fleet. Most of us aren’t \naware of how manipulative we are, how we bargain and act out our feelings. Most of \nus consider ourselves the center of the universe and expect every person or group to \nbe either good or bad to us. This does not work in the market, which is completely \nimpersonal.\nLeston Havens, a Harvard University psychiatrist, wrote: “Cannibalism and slavery \nare probably the oldest manifestations of human predation and submission. Although \nboth are now discouraged, their continued existence in psychological forms demon-\nstrates that civilization has achieved great success in moving from the concrete and \nphysical to the abstract and psychological, while persisting in the same purposes.” \nParents threaten their children, bullies hit them, and teachers try to bend their will \nin school. Little wonder that most of us grow up either hiding in a shell or learning \nhow to manipulate others in self-defense. Acting independently doesn’t feel natural \nto us—but that is the only way to succeed in the market.\n1 I carry in my wallet a free lifetime pass to New York’s Belmont racetrack that belonged to my late \ngreat friend Lou Taylor. It looks like an employee card, but on the “position” line it says—winner. \nHe won many handicapping championships and continued to take money from the racetrack until a \nfew months before he died.\n",

You can’t really determine what \nthe market is likely to do next when you don’t even know what you’ll do next.” \nUltimately, “the one thing you can control is yourself. As a trader, you have the power \neither to give yourself money or to give your money to other traders.” He adds, “The \ntraders who can make money consistently...approach trading from the perspective \nof a mental discipline.”\nAll of us have our own demons to exorcise on the journey to becoming successful \ntraders. Here are several rules that worked for me as I grew from a wild amateur \ninto an erratic semiprofessional and finally into a calm professional trader. You may \nchange this list to suit your personality.\n1.\tDecide that you are in the market for the long haul—that is, you want to be a \ntrader even 20 years from now.\n2.\tLearn as much as you can. Read and listen to experts, but keep a degree of \nhealthy skepticism about everything. Ask questions, and do not accept experts \nat their word.\n3.\tDo not get greedy and rush to trade—take your time to learn. The markets will \nbe there, offering more good opportunities in the months and years ahead.\n4.\tDevelop a method for analyzing the market—that is, “If A happens, then B is \nlikely to happen.” Markets have many dimensions—use several analytic methods \nto confirm trades. Test everything on historical data and then in the markets, \nusing real money. Markets keep changing—you need different tools for trading \nbull and bear markets and transitional periods as well as a method for telling the \ndifference (see the sections on technical analysis).\n5.\tDevelop a money management plan. Your first goal must be long-term survival; \nyour second goal, a steady growth of capital; and your third goal, making high \nprofits. Most traders put the third goal first and are unaware that goals 1 and \n2 exist (see Section 9, “Risk Management”).\n6.\tBe aware that a trader is the weakest link in any trading system. Go to a meet-\ning of Alcoholics Anonymous to learn how to avoid losses or develop your own \nmethod for cutting out impulsive trades.\n7.\tWinners think, feel, and act differently than losers. You must look within your-\nself, strip away your illusions, and change your old ways of being, thinking, and \nacting. Change is hard, but if you want to be a professional trader, you have to \nwork on changing and developing your personality.\nIn order to succeed, you need drive, knowledge, and discipline. Money is impor-\ntant, but less so than any of those qualities. If you have enough drive to work through \nthis book, you’ll acquire much knowledge, and then we’ll close the circle by return-\ning to the topic of discipline in the final chapters.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

The money you want to make belongs to other people who have no intention of \ngiving it to you.\nTrading means trying to take money from other people, while they are trying to \ntake yours—that’s why it is such a hard business. Winning is especially difficult be-\ncause brokers and floor traders take money from winners and losers alike.\nTim Slater compared trading to a medieval battle. A man used to go on a battle-\nfield with his sword and try to kill his opponent, who was trying to kill him. The \nwinner took the loser’s weapons, his chattels, and his wife, and sold his children into \nslavery. Now we go to the exchanges instead of an open field. When you take money \naway from a man, it is not that different from drawing his blood. He may lose his \nhouse, his chattels, and his wife, and his children will suffer.\nAn optimistic friend of mine once snickered that there are plenty of poorly pre-\npared people on the battlefield: “Ninety to ninety-five percent of the brokers don’t \nknow the first thing about research. They don’t know what they’re doing. We have \nthe knowledge, and some poor people who do not have it are just giving their mon-\ney away to charity.”  This theory sounds good, but he soon found out that it was \nwrong—there is no easy money in the market.\nSure enough, there are plenty of dumb sheep waiting to be fleeced or slaughtered. \nThe sheep are easy—but if you want a piece of their meat, you’ve got to fight some \nvery dangerous competitors. There are mean professionals: American gunslingers, \nEnglish knights, German landsknechts, Japanese samurai, and other warriors, all \ngoing after the same hapless sheep. Trading means battling crowds of hostile people, \nwhile paying for the privilege of entering the battle and leaving it, whether alive, \nwounded, or dead.\nInside Information\nThere is at least one group of people who get information before us. Records show \nthat corporate insiders as a group consistently make profits in the stock market. And \nthose are legitimate trades, reported by insiders to the Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission. They represent the tip of the iceberg—but there is a great deal of illegitimate \ninsider trading.\nPeople who trade on inside information are stealing our money. The insider trials \nhave landed some of the more notorious insiders in prison. Convictions for insider \ntrading continue at a steady pace, especially after bull markets collapse. After the \n2008 debacle, a group of executives from the Galleon fund, led by its CEO, have \nbeen sentenced to lengthy jail terms, while a former board member of several lead-\ning U.S. corporations got two years behind bars, and recently a money manager from \nSAC Capital was convicted.\nPeople convicted during the insider trials were caught because they became \ngreedy and careless. The tip of the iceberg has been shaved down, but its bulk contin-\nues to float, ready to hit any account that comes in contact with it.\nTrying to reduce insider trading is like trying to get rid of rats on a farm.

An indi-\nvidual who wants to succeed against the giants must develop patience and eliminate \ngreed. Remember, your goal is to trade well, not to trade often.\nSuccessful institutional traders receive raises and bonuses. Even a high bonus can \nfeel puny to someone who earns millions of dollars for his firm. Successful institu-\ntional traders often talk of quitting and going to trade for themselves. Very few of \nthem manage to make this transition.\nMost traders who leave institutions get caught up in the emotions of fear, greed, \nelation, and panic when they start risking their own money. They seldom do well \ntrading for their own accounts—another sign that psychology is at the root of trad-\ning success or failure. Few institutional traders realize to what a large extent they \nowe their success to their trading managers, who control their risk levels. Going out \non your own means becoming your own manager—we’ll return to this in a later \nchapter, when we focus on how to organize your trading.\nThe Sword Makers\nJust as medieval knights shopped for the sharpest swords, modern traders shop for \nthe best trading tools. The growing access to good software and declining commis-\nsion rates are creating a more level playing field. A computer allows you to speed up \nyour research and follow more leads. It helps you analyze more markets in greater \ndepth. We’ll return to computers and software in Chapter 21, “Computers in Trad-\ning,” ⁜but here it is in brief.\nThere are three types of trading software: toolboxes, black boxes, and gray boxes. \nA toolbox allows you to display data, draw charts, plot indicators, change their \nparameters, and test your trading systems. Toolboxes for options traders include \noption valuation models. Adapting a good toolbox to your needs can be as easy as \nadjusting the seat of your car. \nIn 1977, I bought the first ever toolbox for computerized technical analysis. It \ncost $1,900 plus monthly data fees. Today, inexpensive, and even free, software plac-\nes powerful tools at everyone’s fingertips. I illustrated most of the concepts in this \nbook using Stockcharts.com because I wanted my new book to be useful to as many \ntraders as possible. \nStockcharts.com evens out the playing field for traders. It is clear, intuitive, and rich \nin features. Its basic version is free, although I used its inexpensive “members’ version” \nfor higher quality charting. I still remember how hard it was in the beginning and want \nto show you how much analytic power you can have for free or at a very minimal cost.\nWhat goes on inside a black box is secret. You feed it data, and it tells you what \nand when to buy and sell. It is like magic—a way to make money without think-\ning. Black boxes are usually sold with excellent historical track records. This is only \nnatural because they were created to fit old data. Markets keep changing, and black \nboxes keep blowing up, but new generations of losers keep buying them. If you’re \nin the market for a black box, remember that there is a guy in Brooklyn who has a \nbridge for sale.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

He described several mass manias, in-\ncluding the Tulip Mania in Holland in 1634 and the South Seas investment bubble in \nEngland in 1720.\nThe tulip craze began as a bull market in tulip bulbs. The long bull market convinced \nthe prosperous Dutch that tulips would continue to appreciate. Many abandoned their \nbusinesses to grow tulips, trade them, or become tulip brokers. Banks accepted tulips \nas collateral and speculators profited. Finally, that mania collapsed in waves of panic \nselling, leaving people destitute and the nation shocked. Mackay sighed, “Men go mad \nin crowds, and they come back to their senses slowly and one by one.”\nIn 1897, Gustave LeBon, a French philosopher and politician, wrote The Crowd. A \ntrader who reads it today can see his reflection in a century-old mirror.\nLeBon wrote that when people gather in a crowd, “Whoever be the individuals \nthat compose it, however like or unlike be their mode of life, their occupations, their \ncharacter, or their intelligence, the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd \nputs them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, think, \nand act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would \nfeel, think, and act were he in a state of isolation.”\nPeople change when they join crowds. They become more credulous and impul-\nsive, anxiously search for a leader, and react to emotions instead of using their intel-\nlect. An individual who becomes involved in a group becomes less capable of think-\ning for himself.\nGroup members may catch a few trends, but they get killed when trends reverse. Successful \ntraders are independent thinkers.\nWhy Join?\nPeople have been joining crowds for safety since the dawn of time. If a Stone Age \nhunter encountered a saber-toothed tiger, he had a very slim chance of coming out \nalive, but if hunters went as a group, most were likely to survive. Loners got killed \nand left fewer offspring. Since group members were more likely to survive, the ten-\ndency to join groups appears to have been bred into our genes.\nOur society glorifies free will, but we carry many primitive impulses beneath the \nthin veneer of civilization. We want to join groups for safety and be led by strong \nleaders. The greater the uncertainty, the stronger our wish to join and to follow.\nNo saber-toothed tigers roam the canyons of Wall Street, but your financial sur-\nvival is at risk. The value of your position rises and falls because of buying and selling \nby total strangers. Your fear swells up because you can’t control prices. This uncer-\ntainty makes most traders look for a leader who will tell them what to do.\nYou may have rationally decided to go long or short, but the moment you put on a \ntrade, the crowd starts sucking you in. You start losing your independence when you \nwatch prices like a hawk and become elated when they go your way or depressed if \nthey go against you. You are in trouble when you impulsively add to losing positions \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

When you notice this happen-\ning, try to come back to your senses. If you can’t regain your composure, exit your \ntrades and go flat.\nCrowd Mentality\nWhen people join crowds, their thinking becomes primitive and they become more \nprone to act on impulse. Crowds swing from fear to glee, from panic to euphoria. \nA scientist can be cool and rational in his lab but make harebrained trades after \nbeing swept up in the mass hysteria of the market. A group can suck you in, whether \nyou trade from a crowded brokerage office or a remote mountaintop. When you let \nothers influence your trading decisions, your chance of success goes up in smoke.\nGroup loyalty was essential for a prehistoric hunter’s survival. Joining a union can \nhelp even an incompetent performer keep his job. The market is different: joining a \ngroup tends to hurt you.\nMany traders are puzzled why markets reverse immediately after they dump their \nlosing position. This happens because crowd members are gripped by the same fear—\nand everybody dumps at the same time. Once the selling fit has ended, the market has \nnowhere to go but up. Optimism returns to the marketplace, and the crowd forgets \nfear, grows greedy, and goes on a new buying binge.\nThe crowd is bigger and stronger than you. No matter how smart you are, you \ncannot argue with the crowd. You have only one choice—to join the crowd or to act \nindependently.\nCrowds are primitive, and your trading strategies should be simple. You don’t \nhave to be a rocket scientist to design a winning trading method. If the trade goes \nagainst you—cut your losses and run. Never argue with the crowd—simply use your \njudgment to decide when to join and when to leave.\nYour human nature leads you to give up your independence under stress.  When you put on a \ntrade, you feel the desire to imitate others, overlooking objective signals. This is why you need to \nwrite down and follow your trading system and money management rules. They represent your \nrational individual decisions, made before you entered a trade.\nWho Leads?\nAn inexperienced trader may feel intense joy when prices move in his favor. He may \nfeel angry, depressed, and fearful when prices move against him, anxiously waiting \nto see what the market will do to him next. Traders become crowd members when \nthey feel stressed or threatened. Battered by emotions, they lose their independence \nand begin imitating other group members, especially the group leader.\nWhen children feel frightened, they want their parents and other grown-ups to \ntell them what to do. They transfer that attitude to teachers, doctors, ministers, boss-\nes, and assorted experts. Traders turn to gurus, trading system vendors, newspaper \ncolumnists, and other market leaders. But, as Tony Plummer brilliantly pointed out \nin his book, Forecasting Financial Markets, the main leader of the market is price.\n",

      "text": "42\t\nMASS PSYCHOLOGY\nPrice is the leader of the market crowd. Traders all over the world follow the upticks \nand downticks. Price seems to say to traders, “Follow me, and I’ll show you the way \nto riches.” Most traders consider themselves independent. Few of us realize how \nstrongly we focus on the behavior of our group leader.\nA trend that flows in your favor symbolizes a strong and generous parent calling \nyou to share a meal. A trend that goes against you feels like dealing with an angry and \npunishing parent. Being gripped by such feelings, it’s easy to overlook objective sig-\nnals that tell you to stay or to exit a trade. You may feel happy or frightened, bargain \nor beg forgiveness—while avoiding the rational act of accepting reality and getting \nout of a losing trade.\nIndependence\nYou need to base your trades on a carefully prepared plan instead of jumping in re-\nsponse to price changes. A proper plan is a written one. You need to know exactly \nunder what conditions you will enter and exit a trade. Don’t make decisions on the \nspur of the moment, when you are vulnerable to being sucked in by the crowd.\nYou can succeed as a trader only when you think and act as an individual. The \nweakest part of any trading system is the trader himself. Traders fail when they trade \nwithout a plan or deviate from their plans. Plans are created by reasoning individuals. \nImpulsive trades are made by sweaty group members.\nYou have to observe yourself and notice changes in your mental state as you trade.  Write \ndown your reasons for entering a trade and the rules for getting out of it, including money \nmanagement rules.  You may not change your plan while you have an open position.\nSirens were sea creatures of Greek myths who sang so beautifully that sailors \njumped overboard and swam to them, only to be killed. When Odysseus wanted to \nhear the Sirens’ songs, he ordered his men to seal their ears with beeswax but to tie \nhim to the mast. Odysseus heard the Sirens’ song but survived because he couldn’t \njump overboard. You ensure your survival as a trader when on a clear day you tie \nyourself to the mast of a trading plan and money management rules.\nA Positive Group\nYou don’t have to be a hermit—steering clear of the crowd’s impulsivity doesn’t \nmean you have to trade in total solitude. While some of us prefer doing it that way, \nintelligent and productive groups can exist. Their key feature has to be independent \ndecision making.\nThis concept is clearly explained in a book, The Wisdom of Crowds, by a financial \njournalist James Surowiecki. He acknowledges that members of most groups con-\nstantly influence one another, creating waves of shared feelings and actions. A smart \ngroup is different: all members make independent decisions without knowing what \nothers are doing. Instead of impacting each other and creating emotional waves, \nmembers of an intelligent group benefit from combining their knowledge and ex-\npertise. The function of a group leader is to maintain this structure and to bring \nindividual decisions up for a vote.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

      "text": " 15. PSYCHOLOGY OF TRENDS\t\n45\nWinners feel rewarded when price moves in their favor, and losers feel punished when it moves \nagainst them. Crowd members remain blissfully unaware that by focusing on price they create \ntheir own leader. Traders who feel mesmerized by prices create their own idols.\nWhen the trend is up, bulls feel rewarded by a bountiful parent. The longer an \nuptrend lasts, the more confident they feel. When a child’s behavior is rewarded, he \ncontinues to do what he did. When bulls make money, they add to long positions. \nWhile new bulls enter the market, bears feel they are being punished for selling \nshort. Many of them cover shorts, go long, and join the bulls.\nBuying by happy bulls and covering by fearful bears pushes uptrends higher. \nBuyers feel rewarded, while sellers feel punished. Both feel emotionally involved, but \nfew traders realize that they are creating the uptrend and setting up their own leader.\nEventually a price shock occurs—a major sale hits the market, and there aren’t \nenough buyers to absorb it. The uptrend takes a dive. Bulls feel mistreated, like chil-\ndren whose father slapped them during a meal, but bears feel encouraged.\nA price shock plants the seeds of an uptrend’s reversal. Even if the market recov-\ners and reaches a new high, bulls feel more skittish and bears become bolder. This \nlack of cohesion in the dominant group and growing optimism among its opponents \nmakes the uptrend ready to reverse. Several technical indicators identify tops by \ntracing a pattern called bearish divergence (see Section 4). It occurs when prices \nreach a new high but the indicator reaches a lower high than it did on the previous \nrally. Bearish divergences mark the ends of uptrends and some of the best shorting \nopportunities.\nWhen the trend is down, bears feel like good children, praised and rewarded for \nbeing smart. They feel increasingly confident, add to short positions, and the down-\ntrend continues. New bears come into the market. People admire winners, and the \nfinancial media keeps interviewing bears during bear markets.\nBulls lose money in downtrends, making them feel bad. They start dumping \ntheir positions, and some of them switch sides to join bears. Their selling pushes \nmarkets lower.\nAfter a while, bears grow confident and bulls feel demoralized. Suddenly, a price \nshock occurs. A cluster of buy orders soaks up all available sell orders and lifts the \nmarket. Now bears feel like children whose father has lashed out at them in the midst \nof a happy meal.\nA price shock plants the seeds of a downtrend’s eventual reversal because bears \nbecome more fearful and bulls grow bolder. When a child begins to doubt that Santa \nClaus exists, he’ll seldom believe in Santa again. Even if bears recover and prices fall \nto a new low, several technical indicators will help identify their weakness by tracing \na pattern called a bullish divergence. It occurs when prices fall to a new low but an \nindicator traces a shallower bottom than during the previous decline. Bullish diver-\ngences identify some of the best buying opportunities.\nSocial Psychology\nFree will makes individual behavior hard to predict. Group behavior is more primi-\ntive and easier to track. When you analyze markets, you analyze group behavior. \n",

The problem for most analysts is that \nthey get caught in the emotional pull of the groups they try to analyze.\nThe longer a rally continues, the more analysts get caught up in mass bullishness, \nignore danger signs, and miss the eventual reversal. The longer a decline goes on, the \nmore analysts get caught up in bearish gloom and ignore bullish signs. This is why it \nhelps to have a written plan for analyzing markets. We have to decide in advance what \nindicators we will watch, how we will interpret them, and how we’ll act.\nProfessionals use several tools for tracking the intensity of the crowd’s feelings. \nThey watch the crowd’s ability to break through recent support and resistance levels. \nFloor traders used to listen to the changes in pitch and volume of the roar on the \nexchange floor. With floor trading rapidly receding into history, you’ll need special \ntools for analyzing crowd behavior. Fortunately, your charts and indicators reflect \nmass psychology in action. A technical analyst is an applied social psychologist, usually \narmed with a computer.\n■\n■16. Managing versus Forecasting\nI once ran into a very fat surgeon at a seminar. He told me that he had lost a quarter \nof a million dollars in three years trading stocks and options. When I asked him how \nhe made his trading decisions, he sheepishly pointed to his ample gut. He gambled \non hunches and used his professional income to support his habit. There are two al-\nternatives to “gut feel”: One is fundamental analysis; the other is technical analysis.\nFundamental analysts study the actions of the Federal Reserve, follow earnings \nreports, examine crop reports, and so on. Major bull and bear markets reflect fun-\ndamental changes in supply and demand. Still, even if you know those factors, you \ncan lose money trading if you are out of touch with intermediate- and short-term \ntrends, which depend on the crowd’s emotions.\nTechnical analysts believe that prices reflect everything known about the market, \nincluding fundamental factors. Each price represents the consensus of value of all \nmarket participants—large commercial interests and small speculators, fundamen-\ntal researchers and technicians, insiders and gamblers.\nTechnical analysis is a study of mass psychology. It is partly a science and partly \nan art. Technicians use many scientific methods, including mathematical concepts of \ngame theory, probabilities, and so on. They use computers to track indicators.\nTechnical analysis is also an art. The bars or candles on our charts coalesce into \npatterns and formations. The movement of prices and indicators produces a sense of \nflow and rhythm, a feeling of tension and beauty that helps us sense what is happen-\ning and how to trade.\nIndividual behavior is complex, diverse, and difficult to predict. Group behavior \nis primitive. Technicians study the behavior patterns of market crowds. They trade \nwhen they recognize patterns that preceded previous market moves.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Your job is to analyze this infor-\nmation and bet on the dominant market group.\nWhenever I hear a dramatic forecast, my first thought is “a marketing gimmick.” \nAdvisors issue them to attract attention in order to raise money or sell services. \nGood calls attract paying customers, while bad calls are quickly forgotten. My \nphone rang while I was writing the first draft of this chapter. A famous guru, down \non his luck, told me that he had identified a “once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunity” \nin corn. He asked me to raise money for him and promised to multiply it a hundred-\nfold in six months! I do not know how many fools he hooked, but dramatic forecasts \nhave always been good for fleecing the public. Most people do not change. While \nworking on this update 21 years later, I read in The Wall Street Journal that this same \n“guru” was recently punished for professional misconduct by the National Futures \nAssociation.\nUse common sense in analyzing markets. When some new development puzzles \nyou, compare it to life outside the markets. For example, indicators may give you \nbuy signals in two markets. Should you buy the one that declined a lot before the buy \nsignal or the one that declined a little? Compare this to what happens to a man after \na fall. If he falls down a few steps, he may dust himself off and run up again. But if \nhe falls out of a second-story window, he’s not going to run anytime soon; he needs \ntime to recover. \nSuccessful trading stands on three pillars.  You need to analyze the balance of power between \nbulls and bears.  You need to practice good money management.  You need personal discipline to \nfollow your trading plan and avoid getting high or depressed in the markets.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

A few \nyears later, pocket calculators became available, and I added simple moving averages. \nLater, a TI programmable calculator made it possible to insert tiny magnetic strips \ninto its slit to perform more complex calculations, such as exponential moving aver-\nages and the Directional system. \nFinally, an Apple personal computer appeared on the scene; you could use its joy-\nstick to move a cursor to draw trendlines. In contrast, today’s traders have access to \nimmense analytic power at a very low cost.\nWhile the key concepts of classical charting remain valid, many of its tools have \nbeen eclipsed by much more powerful computerized methods. The best quality of \ncomputerized technical analysis is its objectivity. A moving average or any other in-\ndicator is either rising or falling, and there can be no argument about its direction. \nYou may puzzle over how to interpret its signals, but the signals themselves are clear \nas day.\nClassical charting, on the other hand, is quite subjective, and invites wishful think-\ning and self-deception. You can draw a trendline across the extreme prices or across \nthe edges of congestion zones, which will change its angle as well as its message. If \nyou’re in a mood to buy, you can draw your trendline a little steeper. If you feel like \nshorting and squint at a chart, you’ll “recognize” a head-and-shoulders top.

It remembers price levels, which is why horizontal \nsupport and resistance lines make sense, but diagonal trendlines are subjective and \nopen to self-deception.\nIn my own trading, I use only a small number of chart patterns that are objective \nenough to trust. I pay attention to support and resistance zones, based on horizontal \nprice levels. The relationship between the opening and closing prices and between \nthe high and the low points of a price bar or a candle are also objective. I recognize \n“fingers,” also called “kangaroo tails”— very long bars that protrude from a tight \nweave of prices. We’ll explore these and a few other patterns in this section.\n■\n■17. Charting\nChartists study market data to identify price patterns and profit from them. Most \nchartists work with bar or candlestick graphs that show open, high, low, and closing \nprices and volume. Futures traders also watch open interest. Point-and-figure char-\ntists track only price changes and ignore time, volume, and open interest.\nClassical charting requires only a pencil and paper. It appeals to visually oriented \npeople. Those who plot data by hand can develop a physical feel for prices. One of \nthe costs of switching to computerized charting is losing some of that feel.\nThe biggest problem with classical charting is wishful thinking. Traders seem \nto identify bullish or bearish patterns, depending on whether they’re in a mood to \nbuy or sell. \nEarly in the twentieth century, Herman Rorschach, a Swiss psychiatrist, designed \na test for exploring a person’s mind. He dropped ink on 10 sheets of paper and \nfolded each in half, creating symmetrical inkblots. Most people who peer at these \nsheets describe what they see: parts of the anatomy, animals, buildings, and so on. In \nreality, there are only inkblots! Each person sees what’s on his mind. Most traders \nuse charts as a giant Rorschach test. They project their hopes, fears, and fantasies \nonto the charts.\nBrief History\nThe first chartists in the United States appeared at the turn of the twentieth century. \nThey included Charles Dow (1851–1902), the author of a famous stock market theory, \nand William Hamilton, who succeeded Dow as the editor of The Wall Street Journal. \nDow’s famous maxim was “The averages discount everything,” by which he meant \nthat the Industrial and Rail Averages reflected all knowledge about the economy.\nDow never wrote a book, only his Wall Street Journal editorials. Hamilton took \nover the job after Dow died and laid out the principles of Dow theory in his book, \nThe Stock Market Barometer. He wrote a famous “The Turn of the Tide” editorial fol-\nlowing the 1929 crash. Robert Rhea, a newsletter publisher, brought the theory to \nits pinnacle in his 1932 book, The Dow Theory.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

      "text": " 17. CHARTING\t\n51\nThe decade of the 1930s was the Golden Age of charting. Many innovators \nfound themselves with time on their hands after the crash of 1929. Schabacker, Rhea, \nElliott, Wyckoff, Gann, and others published their books during that decade. They \nwent in two distinct directions. Some, such as Wyckoff and Schabacker, saw charts as \na graphic record of supply and demand. Others, such as Elliott and Gann, searched \nfor a perfect order in the markets—a fascinating but ultimately futile undertaking \n(see Chapter 5).\nIn 1948, Edwards (a son-in-law of Schabacker) and Magee published Technical \nAnalysis of Stock Trends, in which they popularized such concepts as triangles, rectan-\ngles, head-and-shoulders, and other chart formations, as well as support, resistance, \nand trendlines. Other chartists applied these concepts to commodities.\nMarkets have changed a great deal since the days of Edwards and Magee. In the \n1940s, the daily volume of an active stock on the New York Stock Exchange was only \nseveral hundred shares, while now it is measured in millions. The balance of power in \nthe stock market has shifted in favor of bulls. Early chartists wrote that stock market \ntops were sharp and fast, while bottoms took a long time to develop. That was true in \ntheir deflationary era, but the opposite has been true since the 1950s. Now bottoms \ntend to form quickly, while tops tend to take longer.\nThe Meaning of a Bar Chart\nChart patterns reflect the sum of buying and selling, greed and fear among investors \nand traders. Many charts in this book are daily, with each bar representing one trad-\ning day, but the rules for understanding weekly, daily, or intraday charts are remark-\nably similar.\nRemember this key principle: “Each price is a momentary consensus of value of all market \nparticipants expressed in action.” Based on it, each price bar provides several important \npieces of information about the tug-of-war between bulls and bears (Figure 17.1).\nThe opening price of a daily bar tends to reflect the amateurs’ opinion of value. \nThey read morning papers, find out what happened the day before, perhaps ask for \na wife’s approval to buy or sell, and place their orders before driving to work. Ama-\nteurs are especially active early in the day and early in the week.\nTraders who researched the relationship between opening and closing prices \nfound that opening prices most often occur near the high or the low of the daily bar. \nBuying or selling by amateurs early in the day creates an emotional extreme from \nwhich prices tend to recoil later in the day.\nIn bull markets, prices often make their low for the week on Monday or Tuesday, \nwhen amateurs take profits from the previous week, then rally to a new high on \nThursday or Friday. In bear markets, the high for the week is often set on Monday or \nTuesday, with a new low toward the end of the week.\nThe closing prices of daily and weekly bars tend to reflect the actions of profes-\nsional traders. They watch the markets throughout the day, respond to changes, and \ntend to dominate the last hour of trading. Many of them take profits at that time to \navoid carrying trades overnight.\n",

They tend to buy low-\ner openings, sell short higher openings, and unwind their positions as the day goes \non. Traders need to pay attention to the relationship between opening and closing \nprices. If prices closed higher than they opened, then market professionals were probably more \nbullish than amateurs. If prices closed lower than they opened, then market professionals were \nprobably more bearish than amateurs. It pays to trade with the professionals and against \nthe amateurs. Candlestick charting is based, to a large extent, on the relationship \nbetween the opening and closing prices of each bar. If the close is higher, the candle \nis white, but if it is lower, the candle is black.\nThe high of each bar represents the maximum power of bulls during that bar. \nBulls make money when prices go up. Their buying pushes prices higher, and every \nuptick adds to their profits. Finally, bulls reach a point where they cannot lift prices—\nnot even by one more tick.1 The high of a daily bar represents the maximum power \nof bulls during the day, while the high of a weekly bar marks the maximum power of \nbulls during the week.\nThe highest point of a bar represents the maximum power of bulls during that bar.\nFIGURE 17.1  TSLA daily. (Chart by Stockcharts.com) \nThe Meaning of a Bar Chart\nOpening prices are set by amateurs, whose orders accumulate overnight and hit the \nmarket in the morning.

They keep selling short, their selling pushes \nprices lower, and every downtick adds to their profits. At some point they run out of \neither capital or enthusiasm, and prices stop falling. The low of a daily bar marks the \nmaximum power of bears during that day, and the low of a weekly bar identifies \nthe maximum power of bears during that week.\nThe low of each bar shows the maximum power of bears during that bar.\nThe closing price of each bar reveals the outcome of the battle between bulls \nand bears during that bar.

Closing prices on the daily charts of futures are especially important \nbecause your account equity is “marked to market” each night.\nThe distance between the high and the low of any bar reflects the intensity \nof conflict between bulls and bears. An average bar marks a relatively cool market. A \nbar that’s only half as tall as average reveals a sleepy, disinterested market. A bar that’s \ntwo times taller than average shows a boiling market where bulls and bears battle all \nover the field.\nSlippage (see the Introduction) tends to be less in quiet markets.

It \nwould be safer to wait for the next one.\nJapanese Candlesticks\nJapanese rice traders began using candlestick charts some two centuries before the \nfirst chartists appeared in America. Instead of bars, their charts had rows of candles \nwith wicks at both ends. The body of each candle represents the distance between \nthe opening and closing prices. If the closing price is higher than the opening, the \nbody is white, but if the closing price is lower, the body is black.\nThe tip of the upper wick represents the high of the day, while the bottom of the \nlower wick represents the low of the day. The Japanese consider highs and lows rela-\ntively unimportant, according to Steve Nison, author of Japanese Candlestick Charting \nTechniques. They focus on the relationship between opening and closing prices and on \npatterns that include several candles.\nThe main advantage of a candlestick chart is its focus on the struggle between \namateurs who control openings and professionals who control closings. Unfortu-\nnately, many candlestick chartists neglect Western tools, such as volume and techni-\ncal indicators.\nCandlesticks have become quite popular worldwide, and some traders ask me \nwhy I continue to use bar charts. I am familiar with candlesticks, but I’ve learned to \ntrade using bar charts, and I believe that using open-high-low-close bars plus techni-\ncal indicators gives me more information.\nYour choice of a bar or a candlestick chart is a matter of personal preference.

Investing in a market where people believe in efficiency is like play-\ning bridge with someone who’s been told it doesn’t do any good to look at the cards.”\nThe logical flaw of Efficient Market theory is that it equates knowledge with ac-\ntion. People may have knowledge, but the emotional pull of the crowd often leads \nthem to trade irrationally. A good analyst can detect repetitive patterns of crowd \nbehavior on his charts and exploit them.\nRandom Walk theorists claim that market prices change at random. Sure, there is \na fair bit of randomness or “noise” in the markets, just as there is randomness in any \ncrowd. Still, an intelligent observer can identify repetitive behavior patterns of \na crowd and make sensible bets on their continuation or reversal.\nPeople have memories; they remember past prices, and their memories influence \ntheir decisions to buy or sell. Memories help create support under the market and \nresistance above it. Random Walkers deny that memories influence our behavior.\nAs Milton Friedman pointed out, prices carry information about the availability \nof supply and the intensity of demand. Market participants use that information \nwhen deciding to buy or sell. For example, consumers buy more merchandise when \nit is on sale and less when prices are high. Financial traders are just as capable of logi-\ncal behavior as homemakers. When prices are low, bargain hunters step in. A short-\nage can lead to a buying panic, but high prices choke off demand.\nChaos Theory has achieved prominence in the recent decades. Markets are largely \nchaotic, and the only time you can have an edge is during orderly periods.\nIn my view, markets are chaotic much of the time, but out of that chaos, islands of \norder and structure keep emerging and disappearing. The essence of market analysis \nis recognizing the emergence of orderly patterns and having enough courage and \nconviction to trade them.\nIf you trade during chaotic periods, the only ones to benefit will be your broker, \nwho’ll collect his commission, and a professional day-trader, who’ll scalp you. The \nkey point to keep in mind is that once in a while a pattern emerges from chaos. Your \nsystem should recognize this transition, and that’s when you should put on a trade! \nEarlier we spoke about the one great advantage of a private trader over profession-\nals—he may wait for a good trade instead of having to be active each day. The chaos \ntheory confirms that message.\nThe chaos theory also teaches us that orderly structures that emerge from chaos \nare fractal. The sea coast appears equally jagged whether you look down on it from \nspace or an airplane, from a standing position or on your knees through a magnify-\ning glass.

Later in this book (Chapter 39), we’ll \nreturn to this theme, and you’ll see why it is so important to analyze markets in \nmore than one timeframe. We’ll have to make sure that buy or sell messages in both \ntimeframes confirm each other, because if they don’t it means that the market is too \nchaotic and we should stand aside.\nNature’s Law is the rallying cry of a clutch of mystics who claim there is a perfect \norder in the markets (which they’ll reveal to you for a price). They say that markets \nmove like clockwork in response to immutable natural laws. R. N. Elliott even titled \nhis last book Nature’s Law.\nThe “perfect order” crowd gravitates to astrology, numerology, conspiracy theory, \nand other superstitions. Next time someone talks to you about natural order in the \nmarkets, ask him about astrology. He’ll probably jump at the chance to come out of \nthe closet and talk about the stars.\nThe believers in perfect order in the markets claim that tops and bottoms can be \npredicted far into the future. Amateurs love forecasts, and mysticism is a great mar-\nketing gimmick. It helps sell courses, trading systems, and newsletters.\nMystics, Random Walk academics, and Efficient Market theorists have one trait in \ncommon. They are equally divorced from the reality of the markets.\n■\n■18. Support and Resistance\nA ball hits the floor and bounces. Toss it up, and it’ll drop after hitting the ceiling. \nSupport and resistance are like a floor and a ceiling, with prices sandwiched between \nthem. Understanding support and resistance is essential for understanding price \ntrends. Rating their strength helps you decide whether the trend is likely to punch \nthrough or to reverse.\nSupport is a price level where buying is strong enough to interrupt or reverse \na downtrend. When a downtrend hits support, it bounces like a diver who hits the \nbottom and pushes away from it. Support is represented on a chart by a horizontal \nline connecting two or more bottoms (Figure 18.1).\nResistance is a price level where selling is strong enough to interrupt or reverse \nan uptrend. When an uptrend hits resistance, it acts like a man who hits his head on \na branch while climbing a tree—he stops and may even tumble down. Resistance is \nrepresented on a chart by a horizontal line connecting two or more tops.\nIt is better to draw support and resistance lines across the edges of congestion \nareas where the bulk of the bars stopped rather than across extreme prices. Those \ncongestion zones show where masses of traders have changed their minds, while the \nextreme points reflect only panic among the weakest traders.\nMinor support or resistance causes trends to pause, while major support or resis-\ntance causes them to reverse. Traders buy at support and sell at resistance, making \ntheir effectiveness a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n",

Trend identification is an \narea in which computerized analysis is miles ahead of classical charting.\nMemories, Pain, and Regret\nOur memories of previous market turns prompt us to buy and sell at certain levels. \nBuying and selling by crowds create support and resistance. Support and resistance exist \nbecause people have memories.\nIf traders remember that prices have recently stopped falling and turned up from \na certain level, they are likely to buy when prices approach that level again. If traders \nremember that an uptrend has recently reversed after rising to a certain peak, they \ntend to sell and go short when prices approach that level again.\nFor example, all major rallies in the stock market from 1966 until 1982 ended \nwhenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied into the area between 950 and \n1050. That resistance zone was so strong that traders named it “a graveyard in the \nsky.” Once the bulls rammed the market through that level, it became a major sup-\nport area.

The bottom \nline marks the level of support at which buyers overcome sellers. The upper line identifies \nresistance, where sellers overpower buyers.

Note how after a decisive upside breakout in area 1 prices hit resistance, but when \nthey broke above that level it turned into a zone of support (marked 2). The strength of \nthese barriers increases each time prices touch them and bounce away.\nBeware of false breakouts from support and resistance. They are marked by letter “F” \non this chart.

After the price of gold broke above that level on its fifth attempt, the level \nof $1,000/oz turned into a massive support level.\nSupport and resistance exist because masses of traders feel pain and regret. Trad-\ners who hold losing positions feel intense pain. Losers are determined to get out as \nsoon as the market gives them another chance. Traders who missed an opportunity \nto buy or sell short feel regret and also wait for the market to give them a second \nchance. Feelings of pain and regret are mild in trading ranges when swings are rela-\ntively small and losers do not get hurt too badly. Breakouts from those ranges create \nmuch more intense pain and regret.\nWhen the market stays flat for a while, traders get used to buying near the lower \nedge of its range and selling or even shorting near the upper edge. When an uptrend \nbegins, bears who sold short feel a great deal of pain. At the same time bulls feel an \nintense regret that they didn’t buy more. Both are determined to buy if the market \ndeclines to the breakout point and gives them a second chance to cover shorts or \nto get long. The pain of bears and regret of bulls makes them eager to buy, creating \nsupport during reactions in an uptrend.\nWhen prices break down from a trading range, bulls who bought are in pain: \nthey feel trapped and wait for a rally to get out even. Bears, on the other hand, re-\ngret that they haven’t shorted more: they wait for a rally as a second chance to sell \nshort.

      "text": "58\t\nCLASSICAL CHART ANALYSIS\nStrength of Support and Resistance\nThe longer prices stay in a congestion zone, the stronger the emotional commitment \nof bulls and bears to that area. A congestion area hit by several trends is like a battle-\nfield with craters from explosions: its defenders have plenty of cover and are likely to \nslow down any attacking force. When prices approach that zone from above, it serves \nas support. When prices rally into it from below, it acts as resistance. A congestion \narea can reverse those roles, serving as either support or resistance.\nThe strength of those zones depends on three factors: their length, height, and \nthe volume of trading that has taken place in them. You can visualize these factors \nas the length, the width, and the depth of a congestion zone.\nThe longer a support or resistance area—its length of time or the number of hits it took—\nthe stronger it is. Support and resistance, like good wine, become better with age. A \n2-week trading range provides only minimal support or resistance, a 2-month range \ngives people time to become used to it and creates intermediate support or resis-\ntance, while a 2-year range becomes accepted as a standard of value and offers major \nsupport or resistance.\nAs support and resistance levels grow very old, they gradually become weaker. \nLosers keep washing out of the markets, replaced by newcomers who don’t have the \nsame emotional commitment to very old price levels. People who lost money only \nrecently remember full well what happened to them. They are probably still in the \nmarket, feeling pain and regret, trying to get even. People who made bad decisions \nseveral years ago may well be out of that market, and their memories matter less.\nThe strength of support and resistance increases each time that area is hit. When \ntraders see that prices have reversed at a certain level, they tend to bet on a reversal \nthe next time prices reach that level.\nThe taller the support and resistance zone, the stronger it is. A tall congestion zone is \nlike a tall fence around a property. If a congestion zone’s height equals one percent \nof current market value, it provides only minor support or resistance. If it’s three \npercent tall, it provides intermediate support or resistance, and a congestion zone \nthat’s seven percent tall or higher can grind down a major trend.\nThe greater the volume of trading in a support and resistance zone, the stronger it is. \nHigh volume shows active involvement by traders—a sign of strong emotional com-\nmitment. Low volume shows that traders have little interest in transacting at that \nlevel—a sign of weak support or resistance.\nYou can measure the strength of support and resistance in dollars if you multiply \nthe number of days a stock spent in its congestion zone by its average daily volume \nand price. Of course, when making such comparisons, we should measure support \nand resistance zones for the same stock. You can’t compare apples with oranges or \nAAPL with some $10 stock that trades a million shares on a good day.\nTrading Rules\n1.\tWhenever the trend you’re riding approaches support or resistance, tighten \nyour protective stop.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

In that \ncase, your tight stop will salvage a good chunk of profits.\n2.\tSupport and resistance are more important on long-term charts than on short-\nterm charts.\nA good trader monitors his market using several timeframes, but assigns more \nweight to the longer ones. Weekly charts are more important than dailies. If the \nweekly trend is strong, it is less alarming that the daily trend is hitting resistance. \nWhen a weekly trend approaches major support or resistance, you should be \nmore inclined to exit.\n3.\tSupport and resistance levels point to trading opportunities.\nThe bottom of a congestion area identifies the bottom line of support. As prices \ndecline towards it, be alert to buying opportunities. One of the best patterns \nin technical analysis is a false breakout. If prices dip below support and then \nrally back into the support zone, they show that bears have lost their chance. A \nprice bar closing within a congestion zone after a false downside breakout marks \na buying opportunity; set a protective stop in the vicinity of the bottom of the \nrecent false downside breakout.\nSimilarly, a true upside breakout should not be followed by a pullback into \nthe range, just as a rocket is not supposed to sink back to its launching pad. A \nfalse upside breakout gives a signal to sell short as a price bar returns into the \ncongestion zone. When shorting, place a protective stop near the top of the false \nbreakout (Figure 18.3).\nOn Placing Stops  Experienced traders tend to avoid placing them at round num-\nbers. If I buy a stock near $52 and want to protect my position in the area of 51, \nI’ll put a stop a few cents below $51. If I go long at 33.70 in a day-trade and want \nto protect my position in the area of $33.50, I’ll put that stop a few cents below \n$33.50. Because of a natural human tendency to use round numbers, clusters of \nstops accumulate there. I prefer to place my stops at the far ends of such clusters.\nTrue and False Breakouts\nMarkets spend more time in trading ranges than in trends. Most breakouts from trad-\ning ranges are false breakouts. They suck in trend-followers just before prices return \ninto their ranges. False breakouts hurt amateurs, but professional traders love them.\nProfessionals expect prices to fluctuate most of the time, without going anywhere \nfar. They wait until an upside breakout stops reaching new highs or a downside break-\nout stops making new lows. Then they pounce—fade the breakout (trade against it) \n",

It’s a tight stop, and their \nmonetary risk is low, with a big profit potential from prices returning towards the \nmiddle of the congestion zone. The risk/reward ratio is so good that professionals \ncan afford to be wrong half the time and still come out ahead of the game.\nThe best time to buy an upside breakout on a daily chart is when your analysis \nof the weekly chart suggests that a new uptrend is developing. True breakouts are \nconfirmed by heavy volume, while false breakouts tend to have light volume. True \nbreakouts are confirmed when technical indicators reach new extremes in the \ndirection of the new trend, while false breakouts are often marked by divergences \nbetween prices and indicators, which we’ll discuss later in the book.\n■\n■19. Trends and Trading Ranges\nA trend exists when prices keep rising or falling over a period of time. In a perfect \nuptrend, each rally reaches a higher high than the preceding rally, while each de-\ncline stops at a higher level than the preceding decline. In a perfect downtrend, \neach decline falls to a lower low than the preceding decline and each rally tops out \nFIGURE 18.3  EGO and the Euro daily. (Chart by Stockcharts.com)\nFalse Breakouts\nOn the left, a chart of Eldorado Gold Corp. (EGO) shows a false downside breakout dur-\ning gold bears’ final attempt to push gold stocks lower in December 2013. Prices opened \nsharply below support, having gapped down from the previous day’s close. From there, \na rally began. Notice a pullback to the support line a week later, marked by a green ar-\nrowhead. Such pullbacks don’t always occur, but when they do, they offer an excellent \nopportunity to hop aboard a new trend.\nOn the right, a chart of the Euro (represented here by $XEU) shows how an uptrend \nculminated in a false upside breakout. Prices gapped above the line of resistance, trigger-\ning stops and shaking out weak shorts, and that’s when the downtrend began. There was \nno second chance pullback in this market.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

In a trading range, most rallies stop at \nabout the same high level, and declines peter out at about the same low level. Perfect \npatterns, of course, aren’t that common in financial markets, and multiple deviations \nmake life harder for analysts and traders (Figure 19.1).\nEven a quick look at most charts reveals that markets spend most of the time in \ntrading ranges. Trends and trading ranges call for different tactics. When you go long \nin an uptrend or sell short in a downtrend, you have to give that trend the benefit of \nthe doubt and use a wider stop, so as not to be shaken out easily. In a trading range, \non the other hand, you have to use tight stops, be nimble and close out positions at \nthe slightest sign of a reversal.\nAnother difference in trading tactics between trends and ranges is the handling of \nstrength and weakness. You have to follow strength during trends—buy in uptrends \nand short in downtrends. When prices are in a trading range, you aim to do the op-\nposite—buy weakness and sell strength.\nFIGURE 19.1  FB daily, 22-day EMA. (Chart by Stockcharts.com)\nTrend and the Trading Range\nA pattern of higher tops and higher bottoms defines uptrends, while a pattern of lower \nbottoms and lower tops defines downtrends. In the middle of this chart of Facebook, Inc. \n(FB), you see a downtrend defined by three lower lows, marked 1, 3, and 5, and two lower \nhighs, marked 2 and 4. Notice the downtrend of a slow 22-day exponential moving average \n(which we’ll review in Chapter 22) confirming the price downtrend. Its upturn signaled an \nupside reversal, confirmed by new price peaks 6 and 8.\nWe’ve looked at false breakouts in the previous chapter, and you can see them again \nin action here. False breakouts occur when prices cross their support or resistance lines, \nspend one or two days beyond that line, and then return, marking a failed move in the direc-\ntion of the breakout; afterwards prices tend to turn in the opposite direction. Here, a false \ndownside breakout, followed by the upturn of a moving average gave a strong buy signal.\nWe see a mirror image of this pattern after the top 8. There are two false upside break-\nouts, and after the second one, the moving average turns down, giving a sell signal. At the \nright edge of the chart, prices are pulling back up to their declining moving average. Such \npatterns tend to create good opportunities for selling short.\n",

If bears manage to push prices down, bulls return to bargain hunt. They stop \nthe decline, and force prices to rise again. A downtrend occurs when bears are more \naggressive and their selling pushes markets down. Whenever a flurry of buying lifts \nprices, bears sell short into that rally, stop it, and send prices to new lows.\nWhen bulls and bears are about equal in strength, prices stay in a trading range. \nWhen bulls manage to push prices up, bears sell short into that rally and prices fall. \nAs they decline, bargain hunters step in and buy. Then, as bears cover shorts, their \nbuying helps fuel a rally. This cycle can go on for a long time.\nA trading range is like a fight between two equally strong street gangs. They \npush one another back and forth, but neither can control the city block. A trend \nis like a fight in which a stronger gang chases the weaker gang down the street. \nEvery once in a while the weaker gang stops and puts up a fight but then turns and \nruns again.\nCrowds spend most of their time aimlessly milling around, which is why markets \nspend more time in trading ranges than in trends. A crowd has to become agitated \nand surge to create a trend. Crowds do not stay excited for long—they go back to \naimlessness. Professionals tend to give the benefit of the doubt to trading ranges.\nThe Hard Right Edge\nTrends and ranges are easy to see in the middle of a chart, but as you get close to its \nright edge, the picture becomes increasingly foggy. The past is fixed and clear, but the \nfuture is fluid and uncertain. Trends are easy to recognize on old charts, but, unfor-\ntunately, our brokers don’t allow us to trade in the past—we have to make trading \ndecisions at the hard right edge.\nBy the time a trend becomes perfectly clear, a good chunk of it is already gone. \nNobody will ring a bell when a trend dissolves into a trading range.\nMany chart patterns and indicator signals contradict one another at the right edge \nof the chart. You have to base your decisions on probabilities in an atmosphere of \nuncertainty.\nMost people feel very uncomfortable dealing with uncertainty. When their trade \ndoesn’t go the way their analysis suggested, they hang onto losing positions, waiting \nfor the market to turn and make them whole. Trying to be right is an unaffordable \nluxury in the markets. Professional traders get out of losing trades fast. When the \nmarket deviates from your analysis, you have to cut losses without fuss.\nMethods and Techniques\nKeep in mind that there is no single magic method to clearly and reliably identify all \ntrends and trading ranges. It pays to combine several analytic tools. None of them is \nperfect, but when they confirm each another, a correct message is much more likely. \nWhen they contradict one another, it’s better to pass up a trade.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

When rallies keep reaching higher levels \nand declines keep stopping at higher levels, they identify an uptrend. The pattern \nof lower lows and lower highs identifies a downtrend, and the pattern of irregu-\nlar highs and lows points to a trading range (Figure 19.1).\n2.\tPlot a 20- to 30-bar exponential moving average (see Chapter 22). The direction \nof its slope identifies the trend. If a moving average has not reached a new high \nor low in a month, then the market is probably in a trading range.\nFIGURE 19.2  UNP daily, 22-day EMA, Directional system, MACD-Histogram. (Chart by Stockcharts.com)\nTrend Identification \nThe single most important identifier of any trend is the pattern of its highs and lows. Look, \nfor example, at this daily chart of Union Pacific Corp (UNP). Once it broke out of its trading \nrange, its highs, marked by horizontal green lines, kept reaching higher and higher. Simi-\nlarly, its reaction lows, marked by red horizontal lines, kept bottoming out at higher and \nhigher levels. Trying to draw a trendline would be a very subjective exercise because the \nbottoms of UNP did not line up in a straight line.\nThe 22-day exponential moving average (EMA), represented by a red line superimposed \non prices, confirms the uptrend by its steady rise. Notice excellent buying opportunities, sig-\nnaled by quick price dips to their moving average (we’ll return to this pattern in Chapter 22).\nThe Directional system (described in Chapter 24) signaled the start of a new trend when \nthe Average Directional Index (ADX) fell below 20 and then rallied above that level and \npenetrated above the lower Directional Line (marked by a vertical green arrow). MACD-\nHistogram (described in Chapter 23) identified a very powerful trend when it rallied to its \nhighest peak in several months (marked by a diagonal green arrow). Near the right edge of \nthe chart the trend is up, while prices are slightly below their recent high. A pullback to the \nEMA is likely to create a fresh buying opportunity.\n",

The Directional system is especially good at catching early stages \nof new trends (Figure 19.2).\nTrade or Wait\nHaving identified an uptrend, you need to decide whether to buy immediately or \nwait for a dip. If you buy fast, you’ll get in gear with the trend, but on the minus side, \nyour stops are likely to be farther away, increasing your risk.\nIf you wait for a dip, your risk will be smaller, but you’ll have four groups of \ncompetitors: longs who want to add to their positions, shorts who want to get out \neven, traders who never bought (such as yourself), and traders who sold too early \nbut are eager to buy again. The waiting areas for pullbacks are notoriously crowded! \nFurthermore, a deep pullback may signal the beginning of a reversal rather than a \nbuying opportunity. The same reasoning applies to shorting in downtrends.\nIf the market is in a trading range and you’re waiting for a breakout, you’ll have \nto decide whether to buy in anticipation of a breakout, during a breakout, or on a \npullback after a valid breakout. If you aren’t sure, consider entering in several steps: \nbuy a third of the planned position in anticipation, a third on a breakout, and a third \non a pullback.\nWhatever method you use, remember to apply the key risk management rule: \nthe distance from your entry to the protective stop, multiplied by position size can \nnever be more than 2 percent of your account equity (see Chapter 50). No matter \nhow attractive a trade, pass it up if it would require putting more than 2% of your \naccount at risk.\nFinding good entry points is extremely important in trading ranges. You have to \nbe very precise and nimble because the profit potential is limited. A trend is more \nforgiving of a sloppy entry, as long as you trade in the right direction. Old traders \nchuckle: “Don’t confuse brains with a bull market.”\nSpecific risk management tactics are different for trends and trading ranges. When \ntrend trading, it pays to put on smaller positions with wider stops. You’ll be less \nlikely to get shaken out by any counter-trend moves, while still controlling risk. You \nmay put on bigger positions in trading ranges but with tighter stops.\nConflicting Timeframes\nMarkets move in several timeframes at the same time (see Chapter 32). They move \nsimultaneously, and sometimes in the opposite directions on 10-minute, hourly, dai-\nly, weekly and monthly charts. The market may look like a buy in one timeframe but \na sell in another. Even indicator signals in different timeframes of the same stock may \ncontradict one another.

A technical analysis toolbox \nprovides a set of electronic tools for processing market data.\nWhen you decide to get into computerized technical analysis, begin by drawing a \nlist of tasks you want your computer to perform. This will take some serious think-\ning, but it’s much better than getting a package first and scratching your head later, \ntrying to figure out what it might do for you. Decide what markets you want to \ntrack, what types of charts to view and what indicators to use.\nA toolbox draws weekly, daily, and intraday charts; it splits the screen into sev-\neral windowpanes for plotting prices and indicators. A good toolbox includes many \npopular indicators, such as moving averages, channels, MACD, Stochastic, Relative \nStrength Index, along with dozens if not hundreds of others. It allows you to modify \nall indicators and even construct your own.\nA good toolbox allows you to compare any two markets and analyze their spreads. \nIf you trade options, your toolbox must include an options valuation model. Ad-\nvanced packages allow you to backtest trading systems.\nAnother feature of a good toolbox is its ability to scan stocks. For example, you \nmay want to find all stocks among the Nasdaq 100 whose exponential moving aver-\nages are rising, but whose prices are no more than 1% above their EMAs. Can your \nsoftware scan for that? Can it add fundamental parameters to your search, such as \nrising earnings? Think what you want to find and then ask software vendors whether \ntheir products can do it for you.\nThere are good toolboxes at all price levels. A beginner making his first steps may \nsign up with an online service that offers a basic set of computerized tools for free; \nyou can upgrade to a paid level later. Most charts in this book are drawn using just \nsuch a service, StockCharts.com, because I want you to see how much you can do \nwhile spending very little. Some traders find that sufficient, while many of us buy \nprograms that reside on our computers, allowing greater customization. With prices \nof software in a steady decline, you don’t have to worry too much. Buy something \nsimple and inexpensive and upgrade later—it’s a date, not a marriage.\nOnce you’ve decided what package to use, you may want to hire somebody who \nalready uses it to help you set it up on your machine. This can save a great deal of \ntime and energy for inexperienced users.\nA growing number of brokerage firms offer free analytic software to their clients; \nthe price is right, but they tend to have two serious limitations. First, for legal rea-\nsons, they make their software very hard to modify and second, it only works online. \nTraders often ask how to add my indicators to their brokerage software, and the \nusual answer is—you can’t.\nMost brokerage house programs enable you to place and change your orders us-\ning the same analytic software. This can be quite handy and useful for day traders, \nbut less important for longer-term traders. Be sure to disable a common feature that \nshows your equity gains or losses in real time.

End-of-day data is sufficient \nfor position traders, but day traders need real-time data.\nWhen you download the daily data for research, it pays to cover two bull-and-\nbear-market cycles, or about 10 years. Whenever I approach a stock, I like to look \nback at 12 years of trading history to see whether it is cheap or expensive relative to \nits 12-year range.\nWhenever you approach a trade, you must know your edge—what will help you \nmake money. The ability to recognize patterns is a part of my edge, but if a stock’s \nhistory is too short, there are no reliable patterns to identify. That’s why I avoid trad-\ning very young stocks, those with less than a year’s history.\nWhen collecting and analyzing data, don’t chase too many markets at once. Focus \non quality and depth rather than quantity. Begin by following the key market indexes, \nsuch as the Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&P. Many professional traders focus on a \nrelatively small number of stocks. They get to know them well and become familiar \nwith their behavior patterns.\nYou could start out by focusing on a dozen stocks. Many professionals limit them-\nselves to fewer than 100 stocks, which they review every weekend and mark their \nopinions in a fresh column of their spreadsheet. They may select fewer than 10 stocks \nfrom that pool that look promising for the week ahead and focus on them. Build your \nwatch list gradually from the popular stocks of the year; add a few stocks from the \nmost promising industries and some stocks you’ve traded before. Building a watch \nlist is like gardening: you can’t get a beautiful garden in a single season, but you can \nget there over several seasons.\nTry to stick to the data in your own time zone. When I teach overseas, traders often \nask whether I trade in their country. I remind them that whenever you put on a trade, \nyou’re trying to take money out of some other trader’s pocket, while others are trying \nto pick yours. This game is hard enough when you’re awake, but it is risky to trade in \na different time zone, allowing locals to pick your pockets while you sleep. This is why \nI largely limit my trading to the U.S. markets. Many overseas traders complain that \nthey find their domestic markets too thin and ask whether it would make sense for \nthem to trade in the huge and liquid U.S. market. The answer depends on how dif-\nferent their time zone is from the U.S. market’s time zone. For example, the U.S. \nmarkets are easy to trade from Europe where they open at 3:30 p.m. local time and \nclose at 10 p.m. It is much harder to do from Asia or Australia, but it can work if you \ntake a longer view and aim to catch longer-term trends.\nBeginning traders should steer clear of day-trading.

If you \ncompare swing trading and day-trading, it is like playing the same video game at level \none or level nine. You run the same mazes and dodge the same monsters, but the pace \nof the game is so fast at level nine that your reactions must be automatic. Learn to \nanalyze markets at level one—become a swing trader before attempting to day-trade. \nWe’ll return to this topic in Chapter 33, \"Trading Timeframes.\"\nA good place to get started is swing trading, i.e., holding positions for several \ndays. Select popular stocks that have good swings on a good volume. Start out by \nfollowing just a handful. Some swing traders who hold positions for only a few days \nuse real-time data for timing entries and exits, while others manage quite well with \nend-of-day data.\nThree Major Groups of Indicators\nIndicators help identify trends and reversals. They are more objective than chart pat-\nterns and provide insight into the balance of power between bulls and bears.\nA great challenge is that various indicators may contradict one another. Some \nof them work best in trending markets, others in flat markets. Some are good \nat catching turning points, while others are better at riding trends. That’s why it \npays to select a small number of indicators from various groups and learn to com-\nbine them.\nMany beginners look for a “silver bullet”—a single magic indicator, but markets \nare too complex to be handled with a single tool. Others try to poll a multitude of \nindicators and average their signals. The results of such a “poll” will be heavily skewed \nby the indicators you select.\nMost indicators are based on the same five pieces of data: open, high, low, close, \nand volume. Prices are primary; indicators are derived from them. Using ten, twenty, \nor fifty indicators will not deepen your analysis because they share the same base.\nWe can divide indicators into three groups: trend-following indicators, oscilla-\ntors, and miscellaneous. Trend-following indicators work best when markets are \nmoving, but the quality of their signals sharply deteriorates when the markets go flat. \nOscillators catch turning points in flat markets but give premature and dangerous \nsignals when the markets begin to trend. Miscellaneous indicators provide insights \ninto mass psychology. Before using any indicator, be sure to understand what it mea-\nsures and how it works. Only then can you have confidence in its signals.\nTrend-following indicators include moving averages, MACD Lines (moving av-\nerage convergence-divergence), the Directional System, On-Balance Volume, \nAccumulation/Distribution, and others. Trend-following indicators are coincident \nor lagging indicators—they turn after trends reverse.\nOscillators help identify turning points. They include MACD-Histogram, Force \nIndex, Stochastic, Rate of Change, Momentum, the Relative Strength Index, \nElder-ray, Williams %R, and others. Oscillators are leading or coincident indicators \nthat often turn ahead of prices.\n",

This \nis the aim of the Triple Screen trading system (see Chapter 39).\nAs we begin to explore indicators, a few words of caution. Sometimes their sig-\nnals are very clear, while at other times they are quite vague. I’ve learned long ago \nto enter trades only when indicator signals “grab me by the face.” If I find myself \nsquinting at a chart while trying to understand its signals, I flip the page and move \nto the next stock.\nIf you look at a familiar indicator but can’t understand its message, it is most likely \nbecause the stock you’re trying to analyze is in a chaotic stage (see Chapter 17).

Moving Averages\nWall Street old-timers say that moving averages were brought to the financial markets \nafter World War II. Antiaircraft gunners used moving averages to site guns on enemy \nplanes and after the war, applied this method to moving prices. The two early experts \non moving averages were Richard Donchian and J. M. Hurst—neither apparently a \ngunner. Donchian was a Merrill Lynch employee who developed trading methods \nbased on moving average crossovers. Hurst was an engineer who applied moving aver-\nages to stocks in his classic book, The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing.\nA moving average (MA) reflects the average value of data in its time window. \nA 5-day MA shows the average price for the past 5 days, a 20-day MA for the past \n20 days, and so on. Connecting each day’s MA value gives you a moving average line.\nP1 + P2 + … + PN\nN\nSimple MA =\nwhere\t P is the price being averaged\n\t\nN is the number of days in the moving average (selected by the trader)\nThe level of a moving average reflects values that are being averaged and depends \non the width of the MA window.

If it closes at 19, 21, and 20 on three consecutive days, \nthen a 3-day simple MA of closing prices is 20 (19 + 21 + 20, divided by 3). Suppose \nthat on the fourth day the stock closes at 22. It makes its 3-day MA rise to 21—the \naverage of the last three days (21 + 20 + 22), divided by 3.\nThere are three main types of moving averages: simple, exponential, and weighted. \nSimple MAs used to be popular because they were easy to calculate in precomputer \ndays, and both Donchian and Hurst used them. Simple MAs, however, have a fatal \nflaw—they change twice in response to each price.\nTwice as Much Bark\nFirst, a simple MA changes when a new piece of data comes in. That’s good—we \nwant our MA to reflect the latest prices. The bad thing is that MA changes again \nwhen an old price is dropped off at the end of its window. When a high price is \ndropped, a simple MA ticks down. When a low price is dropped, a simple MA rises. \nThose changes have nothing to do with the current reality of the market.\nImagine that a stock hovers between 80 and 90, and its 10-day simple MA stands \nat 85 but includes one day when the stock reached 105. When that high number is \ndropped at the end of the 10-day window, the MA will dive, as if in a downtrend. \nThat meaningless dive has nothing to do with the current trend.\nWhen an old piece of data gets dropped off, a simple moving average jumps. This \nproblem is worse with short MAs but not so bad with long MAs. If you use a 10-day \nMA, those drop-offs can really shake it because each day constitutes 10% of the total \nvalue. On the other hand, if you use a 200-day MA, where each day is responsible for \nonly 0.5%, dropping off a day isn’t going to influence it a lot.\nStill, a simple MA is like a guard dog that barks twice—once when someone ap-\nproaches the house, and once again when someone walks away from it. After a while, \nyou don’t know when to believe that dog. This is why a modern computerized trader is \nbetter off using exponential moving averages, which we’ll discuss later in this chapter.\nMarket Psychology\nEach price is a snapshot of the current consensus of value among all market partici-\npants (see Chapter 11). Still, a single price doesn’t tell you whether the crowd is \nbecoming more bullish or bearish, just as you can’t tell from a single photo whether \na person is an optimist or a pessimist. If, on the other hand, you take a daily photo of \na person for ten days, bring them to a lab, and order a composite picture, it’ll reveal \nthat person’s typical features. You can monitor trends in that person’s mood by up-\ndating that composite photo each day.\nA moving average is a composite photograph of the market—it combines prices \nfor several days. The market consists of huge crowds, and the MA slope identifies \nthe direction of mass inertia. A moving average represents an average con-\nsensus of value for the period of time in its window.\nThe most important message of a moving average is the direction of its slope. \nWhen it rises, it shows that the crowd is becoming more optimistic—bullish.

When prices \nrise above a moving average, the crowd is more bullish than before. When prices fall \nbelow a moving average, the crowd is more bearish than before.\nExponential Moving Averages\nAn exponential moving average (EMA) is a better trend-following tool because it \ngives greater weight to the latest data and responds to changes faster than a simple \nMA. At the same time, an EMA doesn’t jump in response to dropping old data. This \nguard dog has better ears, and it barks only when someone approaches the house.\nEMA = Ptod • K + EMAyest • (1 − K)\nwhere\t\n2\nN + 1\nK =\n\t\nN\t= the number of days in the EMA (chosen by the trader).\n\t\nPtod\t= today’s price.\n\t\nEMAyest\t= the EMA of yesterday.\nTechnical analysis software allows you to select EMA length. An EMA has two \nmajor advantages over a simple MA. First, it assigns greater weight to the last trading \nday. The latest mood of the crowd is more important. In a 10-day EMA, the last clos-\ning price is responsible for 18 percent of EMA value, while in a simple MA all days \nare equal. Second, EMA does not drop old data the way a simple MA does. Old data \nslowly fades away, like a mood of the past lingering in a composite photo.\nChoosing the Length of a Moving Average\nIt pays to monitor your EMA slope because a rising line reflects bullishness and a \ndeclining one bearishness. A relatively narrow window makes an EMA more sensi-\ntive to price changes. It catches new trends sooner, but leads to more whipsaws. A \nwhipsaw is a rapid reversal of a trading signal. An EMA with a wider time window \nproduces fewer whipsaws but misses turning points by a wider margin.\nYou can take several approaches to deciding how long to make your moving aver-\nage or any other indicator. It would be nice to tie EMA length to a price cycle if you \ncan find it. A moving average should be half the length of the dominant market cycle. \nIf you find a 22-day cycle, use an 11-day moving average. If the cycle is 34 days long, \nthen use a 17-day moving average. Trouble is, cycles keep changing and disappearing.\nThere is no single magic “best” number for the EMA window. Good indicators \nare robust—not too sensitive to small changes in their parameters. When trying to \ncatch longer trends, use a longer moving average. You need a bigger fishing rod \nto catch a bigger fish. A 200-day moving average works for long-term stock investors \nwho want to ride major trends.\nMost traders can use an EMA between 10 and 30 days. A moving average should \nnot be shorter than 8 days to avoid defeating its purpose as a trend-following tool. \nAmong the numbers I like are 22 because there are approximately 22 trading days in \na month and 26—half of the number of trading weeks in a year.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

It is better to have a yardstick that’s one yard \nlong and use the same parameters for all your moving averages in the same timeframe.\nDon’t change indicator parameters while looking for trades.

      "text": "78\t\nCOMPUTERIZED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\nOld traders used to follow fast and slow MA crossovers. The favorite approach \nof Donchian, one of the originators of trading with moving averages, was to use \ncrossovers of 4-, 9-, and 18-day MAs. Trading signals were given when all three MAs \nturned in the same direction. His method, like other mechanical trading methods, \nonly worked during strongly trending markets.\nTrying to filter out whipsaws with mechanical rules is self-defeating—filters re-\nduce profits as much as losses. An example of a filter is a rule that requires prices to \nclose on the other side of MA not once, but twice, or to penetrate MA by a certain \nmargin. Mechanical filters reduce losses, but they also diminish the best feature of a \nmoving average—its ability to lock onto a trend at an early stage.\nA trader must accept that an EMA, like any other trading tool, has good and bad \nsides. Moving averages help you identify and follow trends, but they lead to whip-\nsaws in trading ranges. We will look for an answer to this dilemma in the chapter on \nthe Triple Screen trading system.\nMore on Moving Averages\nMoving averages often serve as support and resistance. A rising MA tends to \nserve as a floor below prices, and a falling MA serves as a ceiling above them. That’s \nwhy it pays to buy near a rising MA, and sell short near a falling MA.\nMoving averages can be applied to indicators as well as prices. For example, \nsome traders use a 5-day moving average of volume. When volume falls below its \n5-day MA, it shows reduced public interest in the minor trend and indicates that it \nis likely to reverse. When volume overshoots its MA, it shows strong public interest \nand confirms the price trend. We’ll be using moving averages of an indicator when \nwe work with Force Index (Chapter 30)\nThe proper way to plot a simple moving average is to lag it behind prices by half \nits length. For example, a 10-day simple MA properly belongs in the middle of a \n10-day period and it should be plotted underneath the 5th or 6th day. An exponential \nmoving average is more heavily weighted toward the latest data, and a 10-day EMA \nshould be lagged by two or three days. Most software packages allow you to lag a \nmoving average.\nMoving averages can be based not only on closing prices but also on the mean \nbetween the high and the low, which can be useful for day traders.\nAn exponential moving average assigns greater weight to the latest day of trading, \nbut a weighted moving average (WMA) allows you to assign any weight to any \nday, depending on what you deem important. WMAs are so complicated that traders \nare better off using EMAs.\nDual EMAs\nWhenever I analyze charts, I like to use not one but two exponential moving aver-\nages. The longer EMA shows a longer-term consensus of value. The shorter-term \nEMA shows a shorter-term consensus of value.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

For example, I may \nuse a 26-week and a 13-week EMA on a weekly chart, or a 22-day and an 11-day \nEMA on a daily chart. Please understand there is no magic set of numbers. You should \nfeel free to play with these values, selecting a set that will be unique to you. Just keep \nin mind to keep the difference between the two EMAs near 2:1. It might be simpler \nand more efficient to use the same set of values (for example 26/13 or 22/11) in all \ntimeframes: weekly, daily, and even intraday.\nSince the shorter EMA represents the short-term consensus of value and the \nlonger-term EMA the long-term consensus, I believe that value “lives” between \nthese two lines. I call the space between the two EMAs the value zone.\nMoving Averages and Channels\nA channel consists of two lines drawn parallel to a moving average. Oddly enough, \nthe distance between the upper and the lower channel lines is sometimes described \nas “height” and at other times as “width” of the channel, even though both refer to the \nsame measurement.\nA well-drawn channel should contain approximately 95% of all prices that oc-\ncurred during the past 100 bars. Longer-term markets have wider channels because \nprices can cover greater distances in 100 weeks than in 100 days. Volatile markets \nhave wider (or taller) channels than quiet, sleepy markets.\nChannels are very useful for trading and performance tracking. We’ll review the \nfirst in Chapter 41 (Channel Trading Systems) and the second in Chapter 59 (Trade \nJournal—Measuring Your Performance.)\nPrices, Values, and the Value Zone\nOne of the key concepts in market analysis—the concept that all of us intuitively un-\nderstand but almost never spell out—is that prices are different from values. We buy \nstocks when we feel that their current prices are below their true value and expect \nprices to rise. We sell and sell short when we think that stocks are priced above their \nreal value and are likely to come down.\nWe buy undervalued stocks and sell overvalued shares—but how to define value?\nFundamental analysts do it by studying balance sheets and annual reports, but \nthose sources aren’t nearly as objective as they seem. Companies often massage \ntheir financial data. Fundamental analysts don’t have a monopoly on the concept \nof value. Technical analysts can define values by tracking the spread between a \nfast and a slow EMA. One of these EMAs reflects a short-term and the other \na long-term consensus of value. Value lives in the zone between the two moving averages \n(Figure 22.2).\nVery important: it’s impossible to trade successfully with just a single indicator \nor even a pair of moving averages. Markets are too complex to extract money from \nthem with a single tool. We need to build a trading system using several indicators as \nwell as analyze markets in more than one timeframe.

Value “lives” in the zone between the two moving aver-\nages. Select the parameters for this pair so that the long-term average is approximately \ntwice the length of the short-term EMA. Looking at a chart, you can immediately tell which \nEMA is longer or shorter—the fast one hugs prices more closely, while the slow one moves \nmore slowly. The slow EMA helps identify the trend, while the fast MA sets the boundary \nof the value zone.\nWhen looking to buy a stock, it pays to do it in the value zone, rather than overpay and \nbuy above value. Similarly, when shorting, it pays to wait for a rally into the value zone to \nestablish a short position rather than sell short when prices collapse.\nDuring the uptrend shown on this chart, you can see pullbacks to value, offering attrac-\ntive buying opportunities in areas marked 1, 2, 3, and 4. The downward reversal of the slow \nEMA marks the end of the uptrend.

It appears on the charts as two lines whose \ncrossovers give trading signals.\nHow to Create MACD\nThe original MACD indicator consists of two lines: a solid line (called the MACD \nline) and a dashed line (called the Signal line). The MACD line is made up of two \nexponential moving averages (EMAs). It responds to changes in prices relatively \nquickly. The Signal line smooths the MACD line with another EMA. It responds to \nchanges in prices more slowly. In Appel’s original system, buy and sell signals were \ngiven when the fast MACD line crossed above or below the slow Signal line.\nThe MACD indicator is included in most programs for technical analysis. To cre-\nate MACD by hand:\n1.\tCalculate a 12-day EMA of closing prices.\n2.\tCalculate a 26-day EMA of closing prices.\n3.\tSubtract the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA, and plot their difference as a \nsolid line. This is the fast MACD line.\n4.\tCalculate a 9-day EMA of the fast line, and plot the result as a dashed line. This \nis the slow Signal line.\nMarket Psychology\nEach price reflects the consensus of value among the mass of market participants at \nthe moment of the trade. A moving average represents an average consensus of value \nfor a selected period of time—it is a composite photo of mass consensus. A longer \nmoving average tracks longer-term consensus, and a shorter moving average tracks \nshorter-term consensus.\nCrossovers of the MACD and Signal lines identify shifts in the balance of power \nof bulls and bears. The fast MACD line reflects mass consensus over a shorter time \nperiod. The slow Signal line reflects mass consensus over a longer period. When \nthe fast MACD line rises above the slow Signal line, it shows that bulls dominate the \nmarket, and it is better to trade from the long side. When the fast line falls below \nthe slow line, it shows that bears dominate the market and it pays to trade from the \nshort side.\nTrading Rules for MACD Lines\nCrossovers of the MACD and Signal lines identify changes of market tides. Trading \nin the direction of a crossover means going with the flow of the market. This sys-\ntem generates fewer trades and whipsaws than mechanical systems based on a single \nmoving average.\n",

Signals in \nlonger timeframes lead to greater price moves. For example, the signals of weekly \nMACD-Histogram lead to greater price changes than the daily or intraday MACD. \nThis principle applies to all technical indicators.\nWhen you use MACD Lines and MACD-Histogram on the weekly charts, you \ndon’t have to wait until Friday to find your signals. A trend can turn in the middle of \nthe week—the market does not watch the calendar. It makes sense to perform weekly \nstudies each day. I set my software to plot weekly charts in the traditional manner, \nfrom Monday through Friday, but with a twist: the latest weekly bar reflects trading \nfor the current week, starting on Monday. After the market closes on Monday, my \nlatest ‘weekly bar’ is identical to Monday’s daily bar. The weekly bar on Tuesday \nreflects two trading days, and so on. Because of this, on Monday I take the new weekly \nbar at a heavy discount, but by Thursday I start trusting it a great deal more.\n",

In this sub-\nchapter, we’ll focus on MACD-Histogram, but this concept applies to most indicators.\nDivergences between MACD-Histogram and prices are infrequent, but they give \nsome of the most powerful signals.

They don’t \noccur at every important top or bottom, but when you see one, you know that a big \nreversal is probably at hand.\nBullish divergences occur towards the ends of downtrends—they identify market \nbottoms. A classical bullish divergence occurs when prices and the oscillator both \nfall to a new low, rally, with the oscillator rising above its zero line, then both fall \nagain. This time, prices drop to a lower low, but an oscillator traces a higher bottom \nthan during its previous decline. Such bullish divergences often precede sharp rallies \n(Figure 23.3).\nA\nC\nB\nFIGURE 23.3  DJIA weekly, 26- and 13-day EMAs, 12-26-9 MACD Lines and MACD-Histogram.

In area A, the Dow appeared in a free fall, as Lehman \nBrothers went bust and waves of selling hit the market. The record low A of MACD-H \nindicated that bears were extremely strong and that the price bottom A was likely to be \nretested or exceeded.

It deserves to be pinned to a wall near your trading desk. \nYou won’t always get such a perfect picture, but the closer you get to it, the more \nreliable it’ll be.\nNotice that the breaking of the centerline between two indicator bottoms \nis an absolute must for a true divergence. MACD-Histogram has to cross above \nthat line before skidding to its second bottom. If there is no crossover, there is no \ndivergence.\nAnother key point: MACD-H gives a buy signal when it ticks up from the \nsecond bottom. It does not have to cross above the centerline for the second time. \nThe buy signal occurs when MACD-H, still below zero, simply stops declining and \ntraces out a bar that is less negative than its preceding bar.\nThis divergence of MACD-Histogram in Figure 23.3 was reinforced when MACD \nLines traced a bullish pattern between the bottoms A and C, with the second bottom \nmore shallow than the first. Such patterns of MACD Lines are quite rare. They indi-\ncate that the coming uptrend is likely to be especially strong, even though we cannot \ncall them divergences because this indicator has no zero line. The rally that began in \n2009 lasted almost a year before its first meaningful correction.\nAlso, we can’t call the pattern of lower indicator tops after the bottom C a diver-\ngence. The lower tops reflect a gradual weakening of the uptrend with the passage of \ntime. In order to count as a divergence, MACD-Histogram has to cross and recross \nits zero line.\nBearish divergences occur in uptrends—they identify market tops. A classical \nbearish divergence occurs when prices reach a new high and then pull back, with \nan oscillator dropping below its zero line. Prices stabilize and rally to a higher high, \nbut an oscillator reaches a lower peak than it did on a previous rally. Such bearish \ndivergences usually lead to sharp breaks.\nA bearish divergence shows that bulls are running out of steam, prices are rising \nout of inertia, and bears are ready to take control. Valid divergences are clearly \nvisible—they seem to jump at you from the charts. If you need a ruler to tell wheth-\ner there is a divergence, assume there is none (Figure 23.4).\nThe previous chart featured a striking bullish divergence at the 2009 stock market \nbottom. Now, for a similarly striking illustration of a massive bearish divergence, \nlet’s roll back the clock and examine the 2007 bull market top.\nNotice that the breaking of the centerline between the two indicator tops is \nan absolute must for a true divergence. MACD-Histogram has to drop below its zero \nline before rising to the second top.\nAnother key point: MACD-H gives a sell signal when it ticks down from \nthe second top. We don’t need to wait for it to cross below the centerline again. \nThe sell signal occurs when MACD-H, still above zero, simply stops rising and traces \nout a bar shorter than the preceding bar.\nThe message of a bearish divergence in Figure 23.4 was reinforced by MACD \nLines, which traced a bearish pattern between the tops X and Z.

This is a fairly \ncommon target for bull market breaks. Notice also a kangaroo tail at the bottom Y. In area Z, \nthe Dow rallied to a new bull market high, but the rally of MACD-H was feeble, reflecting the \nbulls’ weakness.

They are even stron-\nger than regular divergences. In order for a triple divergence to occur, a regular \nbullish or bearish divergence first has to abort. That’s another good reason to prac-\ntice tight money management! If you lose only a little on a whipsaw, you will pre-\nserve both the money and psychological strength to re-enter a trade. The third top or \nbottom has to be more shallow than the first but not necessarily the second.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nThis signal occurs when a reliable chart or indicator pattern doesn’t lead to the \naction you expected and prices move in the opposite direction. A divergence may \nindicate that an uptrend is over, but if prices continue to rise, they give the Hound \nof the Baskervilles signal.\nThis signal is named after the story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in which Sherlock \nHolmes was called to investigate a murder at a country estate. He found the essential \nclue when he realized that the family dog didn’t bark while the murder was being \ncommitted. That meant the dog knew the criminal and the murder was an inside job. \nThe signal was given by the lack of expected action—by the lack of barking!\nWhen the market refuses to bark in response to a perfectly good signal, it gives \nyou the Hound of the Baskervilles signal. This shows that something is fundamentally \nchanging below the surface. Then it is time to get in gear with the new powerful trend.\nI am not a fan of  “stop-and-reverse” orders, but make an exception for the Hound \nof the Baskervilles. On those rare occasions when a bearish divergence aborts, I may \ngo long. In the rare instances when a bullish divergence aborts, I look to go short.\n■\n■24. The Directional System\nThe Directional system is a trend-following method developed by J. Welles Wilder, \nJr., in the mid-1970s and modified by several analysts. It identifies trends and shows \nwhen a trend is moving fast enough to make it worth following. It helps traders to \nprofit by taking chunks out of the middle of important trends.\nHow to Construct the Directional System\nDirectional Movement is defined as the portion of today’s range that is outside of the \nprevious day’s range. The Directional system checks whether today’s range extends \nabove or below the previous day’s range and averages that data over a period of time. \nThese complex calculations are best performed on a computer. The Directional \nsystem is included in most programs for technical analysis.\n",

ADX declines when a trend reverses or when a market en-\nters a trading range.

Trade only from the short side when the negative Directional line \nis above the positive one. The best time to trade is when the ADX is rising, show-\ning that the dominant group is getting stronger.\n2.\tWhen ADX declines, it shows that the market is becoming less directional. There \nare likely to be many whipsaws. When ADX points down, it is better not to use \na trend-following method.\n3.\tWhen ADX falls below both Directional lines, it identifies a flat, sleepy mar-\nket. Do not use a trend-following system but get ready to trade, because major \ntrends emerge from such lulls.\n4.\tThe single best signal of the Directional system comes after ADX falls below \nboth Directional lines. The longer it stays there, the stronger the base for the \nnext move. When ADX rallies from below both Directional lines, it shows that \nthe market is waking up from a lull. When ADX rises by four steps (i.e., from \n9 to 13) from its lowest point below both Directional lines, it “rings a bell” on a \nnew trend (Figure 24.2). It shows that a new bull market or bear market is being \nborn, depending on what Directional line is on top.\n5.\tWhen ADX rallies above both Directional lines, it identifies an overheated mar-\nket. When ADX turns down from above both Directional lines, it shows that the \nmajor trend has stumbled. It is a good time to take profits on a directional trade. \nIf you trade large positions, you definitely want to take partial profits.\nMarket indicators give hard signals and soft signals. For example, when a moving \naverage changes direction, it is a hard signal. A downturn of ADX is a soft signal. \nOnce you see ADX turn down, you ought to be very, very careful about adding to \npositions. You should start taking profits, reducing positions, and looking to get out.\nAverage True Range—Help from Volatility\nAverage True Range (ATR) is an indicator that averages True Ranges (described in \n\"How to Construct the Directional System\" above) over a selected period of time, \nsuch as 13 days. Since volatility is a key factor in trading, you can track it by plotting \na set of ATR lines above and below a moving average. They will help you visualize \ncurrent volatility and you can use that for decision making.\nKerry Lovvorn likes to plot three sets of lines around a moving average: at one, \ntwo, and three ATRs above and below an EMA. These can be used for setting up \nentry points and stops, as well as profit targets (Figure 24.3).\nEntries  In the chapter on moving averages, we saw that it was a good idea to buy \nbelow value—below the EMA. But how far below? Normal pullbacks tend to bot-\ntom out near the minus one ATR.\nStops  You want your stop to be at least one ATR away from your entry.

Whenever masses of traders \nbecome gripped by greed or fear, they surge but after a while their intensity fizzles \nout. Oscillators measure the speed of any surge and show when its momentum is \nstarting to break.\nOscillators identify emotional extremes of market crowds. They allow you to find \nunsustainable levels of optimism and pessimism. Professionals tend to fade those ex-\ntremes. They bet against deviations and for a return to normalcy. When the market \nrises and the crowd gets up on its hind legs and roars from greed, professionals get \nready to sell short. They get ready to buy when the market falls and the crowd howls \nin fear. Oscillators help us time those trades.\nOverbought and Oversold\nOverbought means a market is too high and ready to turn down. An oscillator be-\ncomes overbought when it reaches a high level associated with tops in the past. \nOversold means a market is too low and ready to turn up. An oscillator becomes \noversold when it reaches a low level associated with bottoms in the past.\nBe sure to remember that those aren’t absolute levels. An oscillator can stay over-\nbought for weeks when a new strong uptrend begins, giving premature sell signals. \nIt can stay oversold for weeks in a steep downtrend, giving premature buy signals. \nKnowing when to use oscillators and when to rely on trend-following indicators is a \nhallmark of a mature analyst (see Chapter 39).\nWe can mark overbought and oversold oscillator levels by horizontal reference \nlines. Place those lines so that they cut across only the highest peaks and the lowest \nvalleys of that oscillator for the past six months. The proper way to draw those lines \nis to place them so that an oscillator spends only about 5 percent of its time beyond \neach line. Readjust these lines once every three months.\nWhen an oscillator rises or falls beyond its reference line, it helps identify an \nunsustainable extreme, likely to precede a top or a bottom. Oscillators work spec-\ntacularly well in trading ranges, but they give premature and dangerous signals when \na new trend erupts from a range.\nWe’ve already reviewed one important oscillator—MACD-Histogram. We \nlooked at it “ahead of schedule” because it’s derived from a trend-following indicator, \nMACD Lines. We’ll now explore very popular oscillators: Stochastic and Relative \nStrength Index (RSI).\n■\n■26. Stochastic\nStochastic is an oscillator popularized by the late George Lane. It’s now included in \nmany software programs and widely used by computerized traders. Stochastic tracks \nthe relationship of each closing price to the recent high-low range. It consists of two \nlines: a fast line called %K and a slow line called %D.\n",

A narrow window helps catch more turning points, but a \nwider window helps identify more important turning points.\n2.\tThe second step is to obtain %D. It is done by smoothing %K—usually over \na three-day period. It can be done in several ways, such as:\n %D = 3-day sum of (Ctod − Ln) •100\n3-day sum of (Hn − Ln)\nThere are two ways to plot Stochastic—Fast and Slow. Fast Stochastic consists \nof two lines—%K and %D—plotted on the same chart. It’s very sensitive but leads \nto many whipsaws. Many traders prefer to use Slow Stochastic, adding an extra \nlayer of smoothing. The %D of Fast Stochastic becomes the %K of Slow Stochastic \nand is smoothed by repeating step 2 to obtain %D of Slow Stochastic. Slow Sto-\nchastic does a better job of filtering out market noise and leads to fewer whipsaws \n(Figure 26.1).\nStochastic is designed to fluctuate between 0 and 100. Reference lines are usually \ndrawn at 20 percent and 80 percent levels to mark overbought and oversold areas.\nCrowd Psychology\nEach price is the consensus of value of all market participants at the moment of \ntransaction. Daily closing prices are important because the settlement of trading \naccounts depends on them. The high of any period marks the maximum power of \nbulls during that time. The low of that period shows the maximum power of bears \nduring that time.\nStochastic measures the capacity of bulls or bears to close the market near the upper \nor lower edge of the recent range. When prices rally, markets tend to close near the \nhigh. If bulls can lift prices during the day but can’t close them near the top, Stochastic \nturns down. It shows that bulls are weaker than they appear and gives a sell signal.\nDaily closes tend to occur near the lows in downtrends. When a bar closes near its \nhigh, it shows that bears can only push prices down during the day but cannot hold \nthem down. An upturn of Stochastic shows that bears are weaker than they appear \nand flashes a buy signal.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

It pays to combine Stochastic with a long-term \ntrend-following indicator (see Chapter 39). The Triple Screen trading system allows \ntraders to take buy signals from daily Stochastic only when the weekly trend is \nup.

A Stochastic top that is high and wide shows that bulls are \nstrong—it is safer to pass up that sell signal.\n3.\tDo not buy when Stochastic is overbought, and don’t sell short when it is over-\nsold. This rule filters out most bad trades.\nLine Direction\nWhen both Stochastic lines are headed in the same direction, they confirm the short-\nterm trend. When prices rise and both Stochastic lines rise, the uptrend is likely to \ncontinue. When prices slide and both Stochastic lines fall, the short-term downtrend \nis likely to continue.\nMore on Stochastic\nYou can use Stochastic in any timeframe, including weekly, daily, or intraday. Weekly \nStochastic usually changes its direction one week prior to weekly MACD-Histogram. \nIf weekly Stochastic turns, it warns you that MACD-Histogram is likely to turn the \nnext week—time to tighten stops on existing positions or start taking profits.\nChoosing the width of the Stochastic window is important. Shorter-term \noscillators are more sensitive. Longer-term oscillators turn only at important tops \nand bottoms. If you use Stochastic as a stand-alone oscillator, a longer Stochastic is \npreferable. If you use Stochastic as part of a trading system, combined with trend-\nfollowing indicators, then a shorter Stochastic is preferable.\n■\n■27.

When it reaches a peak and turns down, it iden-\ntifies a top. When it falls and then turns up, it identifies a bottom. The pattern of RSI \npeaks and valleys doesn’t change in response to the width of its time window. Trad-\ning signals become more visible with shorter RSI, such as 7 or 9 days.

If you compare volumes of two markets, you’ll see which is more active \nor liquid. You are likely to receive better fills and suffer less slippage in liquid markets \nthan in thin, low-volume markets.\nThere are three ways to measure volume:\n1.\tThe actual number of shares or contracts traded. For example, the New York \nStock Exchange reports volume this way. This is the most objective way of mea-\nsuring volume.\n2.\tThe number of trades that took place. Some international exchanges report vol-\nume this way. This method is less objective because it doesn’t distinguish be-\ntween a 100-share trade and a 5000-share trade.\n3.\tTick volume is the number of price changes during a selected period of time, \nsuch as 10 minutes or an hour. It is called tick volume because most changes \nequal 1 tick. Some exchanges don’t report intraday volume, forcing day traders \nto use tick volume as a proxy for real volume.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFIGURE 28.1  BID daily, 22-day EMA, volume.

Futures of all major curren-\ncies, measured against the U.S. dollar, are traded in Chicago and on the electronic \nexchanges. We can assume that their volume trends are reasonably similar to those in \nthe forex markets, since both respond to the same market forces.\nCrowd Psychology\nVolume reflects the degree of financial and emotional involvement, as well as pain, \namong market participants. A trade begins with a financial commitment by two per-\nsons. The decision to buy or sell may be rational, but the act of buying or selling cre-\nates an emotional commitment in most people. Buyers and sellers crave to be right. \nThey scream at the market, pray, or use lucky talismans. The level of volume reflects \nthe degree of emotional involvement among traders.\nEach tick takes money away from losers and gives it to winners. When prices \nrise, longs make money and shorts lose. When prices fall, shorts gain and longs \nlose. Winners feel happy and elated, while losers feel depressed and angry. When-\never prices move, about half of the traders are hurting. When prices rise, bears are \nin pain, and when prices fall, bulls suffer. The greater the volume, the more pain in \nthe market.\nTraders react to losses like frogs to hot water. If you throw a frog into a hot pail, \nit’ll jump in response to sudden pain, but if you put a frog into cool water and heat \nit slowly, you can boil it alive. If a sudden price change hits traders, they jump from \npain and liquidate losing positions. On the other hand, losers can be very patient if \ntheir losses increase gradually.\nYou can lose a great deal of money in a sleepy stock or a future, such as corn, \nwhere a one-cent move costs only $50 per contract. If corn goes against you just a \nfew cents a day, that pain is easy to tolerate. If you hang on, those pennies can add \nup to thousands of dollars in losses. Sharp moves, on the other hand, make losing \ntraders cut their losses in a panic. Once weak hands get shaken out, leaving behind \na volume spike, the market is ready to reverse. Trends can persist for a long time on \nmoderate volume but can expire after a burst of volume.\nWho buys from a trader who is selling his losing long position? It may be a short \nseller who wants to cover and take profits. It may be a bargain hunter who steps in \nbecause prices are “too low.” A bottom-picker takes over the position of a loser who \nwashed out—he either catches the bottom or becomes the next loser.\nWho sells to a trader who buys to cover his losing short position? It may be a \nsavvy investor who takes profits on his long position. It also may be a top-picker \nwho sells short because he thinks that prices are “too high.” He assumes the position \nof a loser who covered his shorts, and only the future will tell whether he is right \nor wrong.\nWhen shorts give up during a rally, they buy to cover and push the market higher. \nPrices rise, flush out even more shorts, and the rally feeds on itself. When longs give \nup during a decline, they sell, pushing the market lower. Falling prices flush out even \nmore longs, and the decline feeds on itself. Losers who give up on their trades propel \n",

It shows that new \nlosers are replacing those who washed out.\nWhen volume falls, it shows that the supply of losers is running low and a trend is \nready to reverse. It happens after enough losers catch on to how wrong they are. Old \nlosers keep bailing out, but fewer new ones come in. Falling volume is a sign that the \ntrend is about to reverse.\nA burst of extremely high volume also gives a signal that a trend is nearing its \nend. It shows that masses of losers are bailing out. You can probably recall holding a \nlosing trade longer than you should have. Once the pain became intolerable and you \ngot out, the trend reversed and the market went the way you expected, only without \nyou. This happens time and again because most humans react to stress similarly and \nbail out at roughly the same time. Professionals don’t hang on while the market beats \nthem up. They quickly close out losing trades and reverse or wait on the sidelines, \nready to re-enter.\nVolume spikes are more likely to signal an imminent reversal of a downtrend than \nan uptrend. Volume spikes in downtrends reflect explosions of fear. Fear is a power-\nful but short-term emotion—people run fast, dump shares, and then the trend is \nlikely to reverse. Volume spikes in uptrends are driven by greed, which is a slower-\nmoving, happy emotion. There may be a slight pause in an uptrend after a volume \nspike, but then the trend is quite likely to resume.\nVolume usually stays relatively low in trading ranges because there is relatively little \npain. People feel comfortable with small price changes, and flat markets can drag on a \nlong time. A breakout is often marked by a dramatic increase in volume because losers \nrun for the exits. A breakout on low volume shows little emotional commitment to a \nnew trend. It indicates that prices are likely to return into their trading range.\nRising volume during a rally shows that more buyers and short sellers are pouring \nin. Buyers are eager to buy even if they have to pay up, and shorts are eager to sell to \nthem. Rising volume shows that losers who leave are being replaced by a new crop \nof losers.\nWhen volume shrinks during a rally, it shows that bulls are becoming less eager, \nwhile bears are no longer running for cover. The intelligent bears have left long ago, \nfollowed by weak bears who could not take the pain. Falling volume shows that fuel \nis being removed from the uptrend and it’s ready to reverse.\nWhen volume dries up during a decline, it shows that bears are less eager to \nsell short, while bulls are no longer running for the exits. The intelligent bulls have \nsold long ago, and the weak bulls have been shaken out. Falling volume shows that \nthe remaining bulls have greater pain tolerance. Perhaps they have deeper pockets \nor bought later in the decline, or both. Falling volume identifies an area in which a \ndowntrend is likely to reverse.\nThis reasoning applies to all timeframes. As a rule of thumb, if today’s volume is \nhigher than yesterday’s, then today’s trend is likely to continue.\nTrading Pointers\nThe terms “high volume” and “low volume” are relative. What’s low for Amazon may \nbe very high for a less popular stock, while what’s low for gold is high for platinum, \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Most of the time, we compare current \ntrading volume of a stock to its average volume. As a rule of thumb, “high volume” \nfor any given market is at least 25 percent above its average for the past two weeks, \nwhile “low volume” is at least 25 percent below average.\n1.\tHigh volume confirms trends. If prices rise to a new peak and volume reaches a \nnew high, then prices are likely to retest or exceed that peak.\n2.\tIf the market falls to a new low and the volume reaches a new high, that bottom \nis likely to be retested or exceeded. A very high volume “climax bottom” is al-\nmost always retested on low volume, offering an excellent buying opportunity.\n3.\t If volume shrinks while a trend continues, that trend is ripe for a reversal. When \na market rises to a new peak on lower volume than its previous peak, look to \ntake profits on a long position and/or for a shorting opportunity. This technique \ndoes not work as well in downtrends because a decline can persist on low vol-\nume. There is a saying on Wall Street: “It takes buying to put prices up, but they \ncan fall of their own weight.”\n4.\t Watch volume during reactions against the trend. When an uptrend is punctu-\nated by a decline, volume often picks up in a flurry of profit taking. When that \ndip continues but volume shrinks, it shows that bulls are no longer running or \nthat selling pressure is spent. When volume dries up, it shows that the reaction \nis nearing its end and the uptrend is ready to resume. This identifies a good buy-\ning opportunity. Major downtrends are often punctuated by rallies that begin on \nheavy volume. Once weak bears have been flushed out, volume shrinks and gives \na signal to sell short.\n■\n■29. Volume-Based Indicators\nSeveral indicators help clarify volume’s trading signals. For example, a 5-day EMA \nof volume can identify volume’s trends. A rising EMA of volume affirms the current \nprice trend, while a declining one points to the price trend’s weakness.\nThis and other volume-based indicators provide more precise timing signals than \nvolume bars. They include On-Balance Volume and Accumulation/Distribution, de-\nscribed below. Force Index combines price and volume data to help identify areas \nwhere prices are likely to reverse.\nOn-Balance Volume\nOn-Balance Volume (OBV) is an indicator designed by Joseph Granville and de-\nscribed in his book, New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing. Granville used OBV as a \nleading indicator of the stock market, but other analysts applied it to futures.\nOBV is a running total of volume. Each day’s volume is added or subtracted, de-\npending on whether prices close higher or lower than on the previous day. When a \n",

When a stock closes lower, it shows that bears won the day, and that day’s \nvolume is subtracted from OBV. If prices close unchanged, OBV stays unchanged. \nOn-Balance Volume often rises or falls before prices, acting as a leading indicator. \nCrowd Psychology\nPrices represent the consensus of value, but volume represents the emotions of mar-\nket participants. It reflects the intensity of traders’ financial and emotional commit-\nments, as well as pain among losers, which is what OBV helps to track.\nA new high of OBV shows that bulls are powerful, bears are hurting, and prices \nare likely to rise. A new low of OBV shows that bears are powerful, bulls are hurting, \nand prices are likely to fall. When the pattern of OBV deviates from the pattern of \nprices, it shows that mass emotions aren’t in gear with mass consensus. A crowd is \nmore likely to follow its gut than its mind, and that’s why changes in volume often \nprecede price changes.\nTrading Signals\nThe patterns of OBV tops and bottoms are much more important than the absolute \nlevels, which depend on the starting date of your calculations. It is safer to trade in \nthe direction of a trend that is confirmed by OBV (Figure 29.1).\n1.\tWhen OBV reaches a new high, it confirms the power of bulls, indicates that \nprices are likely to continue to rise, and gives a buy signal. When OBV falls be-\nlow its previous low, it confirms the power of bears, calls for lower prices ahead, \nand gives a signal to sell short.\n2.\tOBV gives its strongest buy and sell signals when it diverges from prices. If \nprices rally, sell off, and then rise to a new high, but OBV rallies to a lower high, \nit creates a bearish divergence and gives a sell signal. If prices decline, rebound, \nand then fall to a new low, but OBV falls to a more shallow bottom, it traces a \nbullish divergence and gives a buy signal. Long-term divergences are more im-\nportant than the short-term ones. Divergences that develop over the course of \nseveral weeks give stronger signals than those created over a few days.\n3.\tWhen prices are in a trading range and OBV breaks out to a new high, it gives a \nbuy signal. When prices are in a trading range and OBV breaks down and falls to \na new low, it gives a signal to sell short.\nMore on OBV\nOne of the reasons for Granville’s success in stock market timing was that he com-\nbined OBV with two other indicators—the Net Field Trend indicator and the \nClimax indicator. Granville calculated OBV for each stock in the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average and rated its OBV pattern as rising, falling, or neutral.

Not only did he do all his calculations by hand, he \navoided going online, as he was suspicious of pervasive snooping—and that was years before the \ndisclosures of government spying. He disconnected his computer from the Internet until it was time \nto send out his newsletter.

It was designed as a leading indicator for stocks, but \nseveral analysts applied it to futures. The unique feature of Accumulation/Distribu-\ntion (A/D) is that it tracks the relationship between opening and closing prices, in \naddition to volume. Its concept is similar to that of Japanese candlesticks, which at \nthe time Williams wrote his book weren’t known to Western traders.\nAccumulation/Distribution is more finely calibrated than OBV because it credits \nbulls or bears with only a fraction of each day’s volume, proportionate to the degree \nof their win for the day.\nA/D = Close − Open\nHigh − Low • Volume\nIf prices close higher than they opened, then bulls won the day, and A/D is posi-\ntive. If prices close lower than they opened, then the bears won, and A/D is negative. \nIf prices close where they opened, then nobody won, and A/D is zero. A running \ntotal of each day’s A/D creates a cumulative A/D indicator.\nFor example, if today’s high-low spread was five points but the distance from the \nopen to the close was two points, then only 2/5 of today’s volume is credited to the \nwinning camp. Just as with OBV, the pattern of A/D highs and lows is important, \nwhile its absolute level simply depends on the starting date.\nWhen the market rises, most people focus on new highs, but if prices open higher \nand close lower, then A/D, which tracks their relationship, turns down. It warns \nthat the uptrend is weaker than it appears. If, on the other hand, A/D ticks up while \nprices are down, it shows that bulls are gaining strength.\nCrowd Behavior\nOpening prices reflect pressures that have built up while the market was closed. \nOpenings tend to be dominated by amateurs who read their news in the evening and \ntrade in the morning.\nProfessional traders are active throughout the day. They often trade against the \namateurs. As the day goes on, waves of buying and selling by amateurs as well as \nslow-moving institutions gradually subside. Professionals tend to dominate the mar-\nkets at closing time. Closing prices are especially important because the settlement \nof trading accounts depends on them.\nA/D tracks the outcomes of daily battles between amateurs and professionals. It \nticks up when prices close higher than they opened—when professionals are more \nbullish than amateurs. It ticks down when prices close lower than they opened—\nwhen professionals are more bearish than amateurs. It pays to bet with the profes-\nsionals and against the amateurs.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Use stops and protect yourself by \nfollowing the Hound of the Baskervilles rule (see Chapter 23).\nThere are important parallels between A/D and Japanese candlestick charts, since \nboth focus on the differences between opening and closing prices. A/D goes further \nthan candlesticks by taking volume into account.\n■\n■30. Force Index\nForce Index is an oscillator developed by this author. It combines volume with prices \nto discover the force of bulls or bears behind every rally or decline. Force Index can \nbe applied to any price bar for which we have volume data: weekly, daily, or intra-\nday. It brings together three essential pieces of information—the direction of price \nchange, its extent, and the volume during that change. It provides a practical way of \nusing volume for making trading decisions.2\nForce Index can be used in its raw form, but its signals stand out much more \nclearly if we smooth it with a moving average. Using a short EMA of Force Index \nhelps pinpoint entry and exit points. Using a longer EMA helps confirm trends and \nrecognize important reversals.\nHow to Construct Force Index\nThe force of every move is defined by three factors: direction, distance, and volume.\n1.\tIf prices close higher than the close of the previous bar, the force is positive. If \nprices close lower than the close of the previous bar, the force is negative.\n2.\tThe greater the change in price, the greater the force.\n3.\tThe bigger the volume, the greater the force.\nForce Index = Volumetoday • (Closetoday − Closeyesterday)\nA raw Force Index can be plotted as a histogram, with a horizontal centerline at \na zero level. If the market closes higher, Force Index is positive and rises above the \ncenterline. If the market closes lower, Force Index is negative and extends below \nthe centerline. If the market closes unchanged, Force Index is zero.\nThe histogram of a raw Force Index is very jagged. This indicator gives much \nbetter trading signals after being smoothed with a moving average (see Chapter 22). \n2Remember, we’re talking about the force of market crowds, not the formula in physics.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

It pays to buy when the 2-day \nEMA is negative and sell when it’s positive, as long as you trade in the direction of \nthe trend.\nA 13-day EMA of Force Index tracks longer-term changes in the force of bulls \nand bears. When the 13-day EMA crosses above the centerline, it shows that bulls \nare in control and suggests trading from the long side. When the 13-day EMA turns \nnegative, it shows that bears are in control and suggests trading from the short side. \nDivergences between a 13-day EMA of Force Index and prices identify important \nturning points.\nTrading Psychology\nWhen the market closes higher, it shows that bulls won the day’s battle, and when \nit closes lower, it shows that bears carried the day. The distance between today’s and \nyesterday’s closing prices reflects the margin of victory by bulls or bears. The greater \nthis distance, the larger the victory achieved.\nVolume reflects the degree of emotional commitment by market participants (see \nChapter 28). High-volume rallies and declines have more inertia and are more likely \nto continue. Prices moving at high volume are like an avalanche that gathers speed as \nit rolls. Low volume, on the other hand, shows that the supply of losers is thin, and a \ntrend is probably nearing an end.\nPrices reflect what market participants think, while volume reflects the strength \nof their feelings. Force Index combines price and volume—it shows whether the \nhead and the heart of the market are in gear with each other.\nWhen Force Index rallies to a new high, it shows that the force of bulls is high \nand the uptrend is likely to continue. When Force Index falls to a new low, it shows \nthat the force of bears is intense and the downtrend is likely to persist. If the change \nin prices is not confirmed by volume, Force Index flattens and warns that a trend is \nabout to reverse. It also flattens and warns of a nearing reversal if high volume gener-\nates only a small price move.\nTrading Rules\nShort-Term Force Index\nA 2-day EMA of Force Index is a highly sensitive indicator of the short-term force of \nbulls and bears. When it swings above its centerline, it shows that bulls are stronger, \nand when it falls below the centerline, it shows that bears are stronger.\nSince the 2-day EMA of Force Index is a sensitive tool, we can use it to fine-tune \nsignals of other indicators.

If you delay buying \nuntil the 2-day EMA of Force Index turns negative, you’ll buy closer to a short-\nterm bottom.

When the weekly trend is up, a 2-day Force \nIndex on the daily chart provides an ongoing series of signals that identify buy points. \nInstead of chasing strength and buying high, it’s better to buy during short-term pullbacks, \nwhen a wave goes against the tide. Those waves are marked by the 2-day Force Index \ndropping below zero. Once the 2-day Force Index goes negative, it makes sense to start \nplacing buy orders above the latest bar’s high.

When it is below the centerline, bears are in charge. \nWhen a rally begins, prices often jump on heavy volume. When a 13-day EMA \nof Force Index reaches a new high, it confirms the uptrend. As an uptrend grows \nolder, prices tend to rise more slowly, and volume becomes thinner. That’s when \na 13-day EMA of Force Index starts tracing lower tops.

A bearish divergence between a 13-day EMA of \nForce Index and price gives a strong signal to sell short.

If there is no crossover, then there is no \nlegitimate divergence.\n3.\t A new low in the 13-day EMA of Force Index shows that a downtrend is likely \nto continue. If prices fall to a new low but this indicator rallies above zero and \nthen falls again, but to a more shallow low, it completes a bullish divergence. It \nreveals that bears are losing power and gives a buy signal.\nWhen a downtrend begins, prices usually drop on heavy volume. When a 13-day \nEMA of Force Index falls to a new low, it confirms the decline. As the downtrend \ngrows old, prices fall more slowly or volume dries up—that’s when a reversal is \nin the cards.\nAdding an envelope to the chart of Force Index can help you detect its ex-\ntreme deviations from the norm, which tend to lead to price trend reversals. This \nmethod for catching deviations and potential reversals works well with weekly \ncharts, but not with the daily and intraday charts. This is truly a longer-term tool.\n■\n■31.

Short-term traders should focus on the \ncontracts with the highest open interest. In the futures markets, the highest open \ninterest tends to be in the front months. As the first notice day approaches and \nopen interest of the front month begins to drop, while open interest in the next \nmonth begins to rise, it signals to roll over your position into the next month.\n■\n■32.

Our deep-seated \nwishes remain largely unchanged throughout our lives.\nWhen people join crowds, their behavior becomes even more primitive and im-\npulsive. Individuals may be ruled by the calendar and the clock, but crowds pay no \nattention to time. They act out their emotions as if they had all the time in the world.\nMost traders focus only on changing prices but pay little attention to time. That’s \njust another sign of being caught up in mass mentality.\nThe awareness of time is a sign of civilization.

This simple but effective model helps you buy when prices are \nlow and sell short when they are high, setting you apart from the market crowd.\nWe can define the seasons of many indicators by two factors: their slope as well \nas their position above or below the centerline. For example, let’s apply the concept \nof indicator seasons to MACD-Histogram (see Chapter 23). We define the slope of \nMACD-Histogram as the relationship between two neighboring bars. When MACD-\nHistogram rises below its centerline, it is spring; when it rises above its centerline, \nit is summer; when it falls above its centerline, it is autumn; and when it falls below \nits centerline, it is winter. Spring is the best season for going long, and autumn is the \nbest season for selling short (Figure 32.1).\nIndicator Slope\nPosition Relative to Centerline\nSeason\nPreferred Action\nRising\nBelow\nSpring\nGo long\nRising\nAbove\nSummer\nStart selling\nFalling\nAbove\nFall\nGo short\nFalling\nBelow\nWinter\nStart covering\nWhen MACD-Histogram is below its centerline but its slope is rising, it is spring \nin the market. The weather is cool but turning warmer. Most traders expect the \nwinter to return and are afraid to buy. Emotionally, it is hard to buy because the \nmemories of a downtrend are still fresh. In fact, spring is the best time for buying, \nwith the highest profit potential, while risks are relatively small because we can place \na protective stop slightly below the market.\nWhen MACD-Histogram rises above its centerline, it’s summer in the market—\nand by now most traders recognize the uptrend. It’s emotionally easy to buy in sum-\nmer because bulls have plenty of company. In fact, profit potential in summer is \nlower than in spring, while the risks are higher because stops have to be farther away \nfrom the market due to heightened volatility.\nWhen MACD-Histogram is above its centerline but its slope turns down, it’s au-\ntumn in the market. Few traders recognize that change and keep buying, expecting \nsummer to return. Emotionally, it’s hard to sell short in autumn—it requires you to \nstand apart from the crowd. In fact, autumn is the best time for selling short.\nWhen MACD-Histogram falls below its centerline, it’s winter in the market. By \nthen, most traders recognize the downtrend. It is emotionally easy to sell short in \nwinter, joining many vocal bears. In fact, the risk/reward ratio is rapidly shifting \nagainst bears, as potential rewards are becoming smaller and risks higher because \nstops have to be placed relatively far away from prices.\nJust as a farmer must pay attention to the vagaries of weather, a trader needs to \nstay alert. An autumn on the farm can be interrupted by an Indian summer, and a \nmarket can stage a strong rally in the autumn. A sudden freeze can hit the fields in \nspring, and the market can drop early in a bull move. A trader needs to use several \nindicators and techniques to avoid getting whipsawed.\nThe concept of indicator seasons focuses a trader’s attention on the passage of time. \nIt helps you plan for the season ahead instead of mindlessly following other people.\n",

Do you think it’ll be a year, a week, \nor an hour? A serious trader plans the expected duration of every trade. Various \ntimeframes offer different opportunities and carry different risks. We can roughly \ndivide all trades into three groups:\n1.\tLong-term trading or investing—The expected duration of a position is \nmeasured in months, sometimes years.\nAdvantages: requires little day-to-day attention and may lead to spectacular gains.\nDisadvantage: drawdowns can be intolerably severe.\n2.\tSwing trading—The expected duration of a trade is measured in days, some-\ntimes weeks.\nAdvantages: a wealth of trading opportunities, fairly tight risk control.\nDisadvantage: will miss major trends.\n3.\tDay-trading—The expected duration of a trade is measured in minutes, rarely \nhours.\nAdvantages: great many opportunities, no overnight risk.\nDisadvantages: demands instant reflexes; transaction costs become a factor.\nIf you decide to operate in more than one timeframe, consider making those \ntrades in different accounts. This will allow you to evaluate your performance in each \ntimeframe rather than lump together apples and oranges.\nInvesting\nThe decision to invest or trade for the long term is almost always based on some fun-\ndamental idea. You may recognize a new technological trend or an exciting product \nthat can greatly increase the value of a company. Investing demands a firm conviction \nand a great supply of patience if you are to hold that position through the inevitable \npullbacks and periods of flat prices. These tough challenges make successful investing \nextremely hard.\nMajor trends that are easily seen on long-term charts appear uncertain and foggy \nin real time, especially when a stock enters a drawdown.

Let me illustrate this using an example of Apple Inc.

Its \nuptrend looks grand in retrospect, but ask yourself, honestly, would you have been \nable to hold though multiple drawdowns, some of them exceeding 50%. Remember \nthat such drawdowns often mark the ends of uptrends.\nA sensible way to deal with the challenge of investing is to implement your funda-\nmental idea with the help of technical trading tools. When you decide to buy, check \nout technical signals to ensure you’re getting a relative bargain rather than paying full \nprice. If your investment soars, use technical tools to identify overvalued zones; take \nyour profits there and be ready to repurchase during the inevitable pullbacks. This \nplan demands a high degree of attention, focus, and perseverance. Figure 33.2 is an \nexample that was taken from my trading diary.\n1\n2\n3\n4\nFIGURE 33.1  AAPL weekly.

A professional trader \ncarefully manages his money, quickly cuts losing trades and protects his capital to \nallow his equity to grow.\nIf investing is like hunting the big game, swing trading is like rabbit hunting. If your \nlivelihood depends on hunting, shooting rabbits is a much more reliable way of put-\nting meals on the table. Carefully entering and exiting swing trades, while cautiously \nmanaging money, is a realistic way of surviving and prospering in the markets.\nDay-Trading\nDay-trading means entering and exiting trades within a single market session. Rapid \nbuying and selling in front of a flashing screen demands the highest levels of concen-\ntration and discipline. Paradoxically, it attracts the most impulsive and gambling-\nprone people.\nDay-trading appears deceptively easy. Brokerage firms hide customer statistics \nfrom the public, but in 2000, state regulators in Massachusetts subpoenaed broker-\nage house records, which showed that after six months only 16% of day-traders \nmade money.\nWhatever gaps you may have in your knowledge or discipline, day-trading will find \nthem fast and hit you hard in your weak spots.

You’ll use your already developed skills and will only need to adjust to \na faster game. A market newbie who stumbles into day-trading is a gift to the pros.\nMake sure to write down your action plan for day-trading: what will prompt you \nto enter or exit, to hold or cut. Be prepared to invest plenty of time: day-trading \nchews up long hours in front of multiple screens.\nAnother difficulty of day-trading is that you shoot at much smaller targets. This is \nreflected in the height of price channels. Elsewhere in this book, you’ll read that a \ngood measure of a trader’s performance is the percentage of the channel or an enve-\nlope he captures in a trade. Taking 30% or more of a channel’s height earns you an \nA grade, while capturing 10% of that channel earns you a C (see Chapter 55).

When NH-NL is above its centerline, it shows that more market leaders \nare bullish than bearish and it is better to trade from the long side. When NH-NL \nis below its centerline, it shows that bearish leadership is stronger, and it’s better to \ntrade from the short side. NH-NL can stay above its centerline for months at a time \nin bull markets and below its centerline for months in bear markets.\nIf NH-NL stays negative for several months but then rallies above its centerline, it \nsignals that a bull move is likely to begin. It is time to look for buying opportunities, \nusing oscillators for precise timing. If NH-NL stays positive for several months but \nthen falls below its centerline, it shows that a bear move is likely to begin. It is time \nto look for shorting opportunities using oscillators for precise timing.\nNH-NL Trends\nWhen the market rallies and NH-NL rises, it confirms uptrends. When NH-NL de-\nclines together with the market, it confirms downtrends.\n1.\tA rise in NH-NL shows that it’s safe to hold long positions and add to them. If \nNH-NL declines while the broad market stays flat or rallies, it is time to take \nprofits on long trades. When NH-NL falls below zero, it shows that bearish lead-\nership is strong and it’s safe to hold short positions and even add to them. If the \nmarket continues to fall but NH-NL rises, it shows that the downtrend is not \nwell led—it’s time to cover shorts.\n2.\tIf NH-NL rises on a flat day, it flashes a bullish message and gives a buy signal. It \nshows that officers are going over the top while the soldiers are still crouching \nin their foxholes. When NH-NL falls on a flat day, it gives a signal to sell short. \nIt shows that officers are deserting while the troops are still holding their posi-\ntions. Soldiers aren’t stupid—if their officers start running away, they will not \nstay and fight.\nNH-NL Divergences\nIf the latest market peak is confirmed by a new high of NH-NL, that rally is likely to \ncontinue, even if punctuated by a decline. When a new market low is accompanied by \na new low in NH-NL, it shows that bears are well led and the downtrend is likely to \npersist. On the other hand, divergences between the patterns of NH-NL and broad \nmarket indexes show that leaders are deserting and the trends are likely to reverse.\n1.\tIf NH-NL traces a lower peak while the market rallies to a new high, it creates \na bearish divergence.

It shows that bearish lead-\nership is shrinking. If the latest low of NH-NL is shallow, in the low hundreds, \nit shows that the bearish leadership is exhausted and a major upside reversal is \nnear. If the latest low sinks deep, then bears still have some strength, and the \ndowntrend may pause but not reverse. Keep in mind that bullish divergences at \nstock market bottoms tend to develop faster than bearish divergences at market \ntops: buy fast and sell slowly.\nNH-NL in Multiple Timeframes and  \nLook-Back Periods\nMarkets move simultaneously in different timeframes. My original work on the NH-\nNL focused on the daily charts with a one-year look-back period—counting stocks \nthat have reached a new high or a new low for their latest 52-week range. I have since \nadded several dimensions for a deeper understanding of this key indicator.\nWeekly NH-NL\nThe weekly NH-NL helps confirm major stock market trends and identify major \nreversals. I build it from the daily data of barchart.com, mentioned above, by run-\nning a five-day moving total. I plot the result underneath a weekly chart of the \nS&P 500.\nThe weekly NH-NL gives its most important signals when it reaches extreme \nlevels and also by divergences. To understand its logic, keep in mind how the weekly \nNH-NL is constructed. For example, if the weekly NH-NL rises to a +1,500 level, it \nmeans that in each of the past five trading days there were on average 300 more New \nHighs than New Lows. It takes a period of sustainable bullishness or bearishness to \npush the weekly NH-NL to an extreme.\nThese are the most important signals of weekly NH-NL:\n■\n■When it drops below minus 4,000 and then rallies above that level, it delivers \nmajor buy signals.\n■\n■When the weekly NH-NL rises above plus 2,500, it confirms bull markets.\n■\n■When the tops or bottoms of weekly NH-NL diverge from price patterns, they \nsignal important reversals.\nA drop below −4,000 reflects an unsustainable market panic. To fall that low, the \nmarket has to deliver an average of 800 more daily New Lows than New Highs for \nfive days in a row. Such massive panic is not going to last. When the weekly NH-NL \nrises above −4,000, it flashes a buy signal I call a Spike. It’s so powerful and effective \nin both bull and bear markets that I named our SpikeTrade group after it. This signal \nmisfired only once in several decades, as you’ll see on the chart in Figure 34.2.\n",

When you see it above that \nlevel, you know you’re in a bull market, with higher prices likely ahead.\nThe 65-day and 20-day NH-NL\nOne of the great innovations in the New High–New Low analysis in recent years \nwas the addition of two new look-back windows: a 20-day and a 65-day. While the \nregular daily NH-NL compares each day’s high and low to the high-low range for \nthe preceding year, a 20-day NH-NL compares it only to the preceding month and \na 65-day NH-NL to the preceding quarter. These shorter-term views of the NH-NL \nare useful for short-term timing.\nThese two new time windows deliver more sensitive signals than the standard \nyear-long NH-NL. The logic is simple: before a stock reaches a new high for the year, \nit must first make a new high for the month and then for the quarter. If a stock has \nbeen in a downtrend, it may take a long time to recover and reach a new yearly high, \nbut it can reach monthly and quarterly highs much sooner.\nIn addition to the usual signals, such as trends and divergences, a very sharp short-\nterm buy signal occurs when the 20-day NH-NL drops below minus 500 and then \nFIGURE 34.2  S&P 500 weekly, 26-week EMA, NH-NL weekly.

We call \nthis a “Spike bounce” signal (see Chapter 54). \nTracking market leaders with the help of NH-NL helps improve timing. There are \ntwo ways to utilize the New High–New Low signals. First, since individual stocks \nlargely depend on broad market trends, we can use NH-NL signals to decide when \nto buy or sell our stocks. Furthermore, we can use NH-NL signals to trade vehicles \nthat track the broad market, such as the S&P e-mini futures.\n■\n■35. Stocks above 50-Day MA\nThis broad stock market indicator is based on the key concepts regarding prices and \nmoving averages  (Figure 35.1). Each price represents a momentary consensus of value \namong market participants, while a moving average represents an average consensus \nof value during its time window. This means that when a stock trades above its MA, \nthe current consensus of value is above average—bullish. When a stock trades below \nits MA, the current consensus of value is below average—bearish.\nWhen the market is trending higher, the percentage of stocks above their moving \naverages keeps growing. In a broad downtrend, the number of stocks above their \nMAs keeps shrinking.\nFIGURE 35.1  S&P 500 weekly and 26-week MA; Stocks above 50 MA with reference lines at 75% and \n25%. (Chart by TradeStation)\nStocks above 50-Day MA\nWhen the “stocks above their 50-day MA” indicator reaches an extreme—above 75% or \nbelow 25% and then moves away from that level, it shows that the intermediate-term trend \nhas reached a likely turning point. A reversal of this indicator flashes a signal for the entire \nmarket: buy when it turns up and sell when it turns down. In the latter part of 2013, as the \nmarket started going up with almost no pullbacks, buy signals from upside reversals began \nto occur at levels higher than 25%.

It plots that percentage as a line that fluctuates between 0% and 100%. We \ncan use the pattern of this line to confirm market trends and anticipate reversals.\nThe indicator for tracking the number of stocks above their 50-day MAs is in-\ncluded in many software packages. I like to view it on a weekly chart, where it helps \ncatch intermediate reversals—market turns that augur in trends that last anywhere \nfrom several weeks to several months. You don’t need to look at this indicator daily, \nbut it can be an important part of weekend homework.\nIn theory, the highest possible reading of this indicator would be 100%, if all stocks \nrallied above their MAs. Its lowest possible reading of 0% would occur if all stocks \nwere to fall below their MAs. In practice, only exceptional market moves swing it \nnear the 90% or 10% extremes.

I draw two reference lines on its chart at 75% and 25% and \nstart looking for the market turn as this indicator approaches those levels.\nThe percentage of stocks above their 50-day MA gives its trading signals not by \nreaching any certain levels but rather by reversing near those levels. It signals the \ncompletion of a top by rising to or above the upper reference line and then sinking \nbelow that line. It signals that a bottom has been formed when it falls below or even \nnear the lower reference line and then turns up.\nNotice that the tops of this indicator tend to be broad, while its bottoms are \nsharper. Tops are formed by greed, which is a happier, longer-lasting emotion. Bot-\ntoms are formed by fear—a more intense and shorter-lived emotion.\nWhile some of this indicator’s signals are right on time in catching reversals, \nothers mark only temporary pauses in major trends. Let this serve as a reminder \nnever to rely on a single indicator for trading decisions. Use multiple tools: when \nthey confirm each other’s signals, they reinforce one another.\n■\n■36. Other Stock Market Indicators\nOnly a handful of general market indicators have stood the harsh test of time. Many \nthat used to be popular in previous decades have been swept away by the flood of \nnew trading vehicles. The New High–New Low Index and Stocks Above 50-day MA, \nreviewed above, continue to work because of their clear logic. Several other indica-\ntors are listed below. Whatever tools you choose, be sure to understand how they \nwork and what exactly they measure. Select a few and track them on a regular basis, \nuntil you come to trust their signals.\nAdvance/Decline\nThe Advance/Decline line (the A/D line) tracks the degree of mass participation in \nrallies and declines. Each day it adds up the number of stocks that closed higher and \nsubtracts the number of stocks that closed lower.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

OTHER STOCK MARKET INDICATORS\t\n141\nWhile the Dow Jones Industrials track the behavior of the generals and the New \nHigh–New Low Index focuses on the officers, the A/D line shows whether soldiers \nare following their leaders. A rally is more likely to persist when the A/D line rises \nto a new high, while a decline is likely to deepen if A/D falls to a new low in step \nwith the Dow.\nThe A/D line is based on the day’s closing prices for each stock at any exchange: \ntake the number of advancing stocks, subtract the number of declining stocks, and \nignore unchanged stocks. The result will be positive or negative, depending on \nwhether more stocks advanced or declined during the day. For example, if 4,000 \nstocks were traded, 2,600 advanced, 900 declined, and 500 were unchanged, then \nAdvance/Decline equals +1,700 (2,600−900).

When finan-\ncial journalists and letter writers reach a high degree of bullish or bearish consensus, \nit’s a sign that the trend has been going on for so long that a reversal is near.\nConsensus indicators, also called contrary opinion indicators, are not suitable for \nprecision timing, but they draw attention to the fact that a trend is near its exhaus-\ntion level. When you see that message, switch to technical indicators for more pre-\ncise timing of a trend reversal.\nA trend can continue as long as bulls and bears remain in conflict. A high degree \nof consensus precedes reversals. When the crowd becomes highly bullish, get ready \nto sell, and when it becomes strongly bearish, get ready to buy. This is the contrary \nopinion theory, whose foundations were laid by Charles Mackay, a Scottish barris-\nter. His classic book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (1841) \ndescribes the infamous Dutch Tulip Mania and the South Seas Bubble in England. \nHumphrey B. Neill in the United States applied the theory of contrary opinion to \nstocks and other financial markets. In his book, The Art of Contrary Thinking, he made \nit clear why the majority must be wrong at the market’s turning points: prices are es-\ntablished by crowds, and by the time the majority turns bullish, there aren’t enough \nnew buyers to support a bull market.\nAbraham W. Cohen, an old New York lawyer whom I met in the early 1980s, came \nup with the idea of polling market advisors and using their responses as a proxy for \nthe entire body of traders. Cohen was a skeptic who spent many years on Wall Street \nand saw that advisors as a group performed no better than the market crowd. In \n1963, he established a service called Investors Intelligence for tracking letter writers. \nWhen the majority of them became bearish, Cohen identified a buying opportu-\nnity. Selling opportunities were marked by strong bullishness among letter writers. \nAnother writer, James H. Sibbet, applied this theory to commodities, setting up an \nadvisory service called Market Vane.\nTracking Advisory Opinion\nLetter writers follow trends out of fear of losing subscribers by missing major moves. \nIn addition, bullishness helps sell subscriptions, while bearish comments turn off \nsubscribers. Even in a bear market, we rarely see more bears than bulls among advi-\nsors for more than a few weeks at a time.\nThe longer a trend continues, the louder the letter writers proclaim it. They are \nmost bullish at market tops and most bearish at market bottoms. When the mass of \nletter writers turns strongly bullish or bearish, it’s a good idea to look for trades in \nthe opposite direction.\nSome advisors are very skilled at doubletalk. The man who speaks from both sides \nof his mouth can claim that he was right regardless of what the market did, but edi-\ntors of tracking services have plenty of experience pinning down such lizards.\nWhen the original Trading for a Living came out, only two services tracked advi-\nsory opinions: Investors Intelligence and Market Vane.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports purchases and sales \nby corporate insiders. Officers of publicly traded companies know when to buy or \nsell their shares.\nPositions of large futures traders, including hedge funds, are reported to the CFTC \nwhen their sizes reach the so-called reporting levels. At the time of this writing, \nif you are long or short 250 contracts of corn or 200 contracts of gold, the CFTC \nclassifies you as a big speculator. Brokers report those positions to the CFTC, which \ncompiles the data and releases summaries on Fridays.\nThe CFTC also sets up the maximum number of contracts a speculator is allowed \nto hold in any given market— these are called position limits. Those limits are set \nto prevent very large speculators from accumulating positions that are big enough to \nbully the markets.\nThe CFTC divides all market participants into three groups: commercials, large \nspeculators, and small speculators. Commercials, also known as hedgers, are \nfirms or individuals who deal in actual commodities in the normal course of their \nbusiness. In theory, they trade futures to hedge business risks. For example, a bank \ntrades interest rate futures to hedge its loan portfolio, while a food processing com-\npany trades wheat futures to offset the risks of buying grain. Hedgers post smaller \nmargins and are exempt from speculative position limits.\nLarge speculators are those whose positions have reached reporting levels. The \nCFTC reports buying and selling by commercials and large speculators. To find the \npositions of small traders, you need to take the open interest and subtract from it \nthe holdings of the first two groups.\nThe divisions between hedgers, big speculators, and small speculators are \nsomewhat artificial. Smart small traders grow into big traders, dumb big traders \nbecome small traders, and many hedgers speculate. Some market participants play \ngames that distort the CFTC reports. For example, an acquaintance who owns \na brokerage firm sometimes registers his wealthy speculator clients as hedgers, \nclaiming they trade stock index and bond futures to hedge their stock and bond \nportfolios.\nThe commercials can legally speculate in the futures markets using inside infor-\nmation. Some of them are big enough to play futures markets against cash markets. \nFor example, an oil firm may buy crude oil futures, divert several tankers, and hold \nthem offshore in order to tighten supplies and push up futures prices. They can take \nprofits on long positions, go short, and then deliver several tankers at once to refin-\ners in order to push crude futures down a bit and cover shorts. Such manipulation is \nillegal, and most firms hotly deny that it takes place.\nAs a group, commercials have the best track record in the futures markets. They \nhave inside information and are well-capitalized. It pays to follow them because they \nare successful in the long run. Big speculators used to be successful wealthy individu-\nals who took careful risks with their own money. That has changed, and today most \nbig traders are commodity funds. These trend-following behemoths do poorly as \na group. The masses of small traders are the proverbial “wrong-way Corrigans” of \nthe markets.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Commercials \noften short futures because many of them own physical commodities. Small traders \nare usually long, reflecting their perennial optimism. To draw valid conclusions from \nthe CFTC reports, you need to compare current positions to their historical norms.\nLegal Insider Trading\nOfficers and investors who hold more than 5 percent of the shares in a publicly \ntraded company must report their buying and selling to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. The SEC tabulates insider purchases and sales, and releases this data to \nthe public.\nCorporate insiders have a long record of buying stocks when they’re cheap and \nselling them high. Insider buying emerges after severe market drops, and insider sell-\ning accelerates when the market rallies and becomes overpriced.\nBuying or selling by a single insider matters little: an executive may sell shares \nto meet major personal expenses or he may buy them to exercise stock options. \nAnalysts who researched legal insider trading found that insider buying or selling \nwas meaningful only if more than three executives or large stockholders bought or \nsold within a month. These actions reveal that something very positive or negative is \nabout to happen. A stock is likely to rise if three insiders buy in one month and to fall \nif three insiders sell within a month.\nClusters of insider buying tend to have a better predictive value than clusters of \nselling. That’s because insiders are willing to sell a stock for many reasons (diversifi-\ncation, buying a second home, sending a kid to college) but they are willing to buy \nfor one main reason—they expect their company’s stock to go up.\nShort Interest\nWhile the numbers of futures and options contracts held long and short is equal \nby definition, in the stock market there is always a huge disparity between the two \ncamps. Most people, including professional fund managers, buy stocks, but very few \nsell them short.\nAmong the data reported by exchanges is the number of shares being held short \nfor any stock. Since the absolute numbers vary a great deal, it pays to put them into \na perspective by comparing the number of shares held short to that stock’s float (the \ntotal number of publicly owned shares available for trading). This number, “Short \nPercent of Float,” tends to run about one or two percent. Another useful way to \nlook at short interest is by comparing it to the average daily volume. By doing this, \nwe ask a hypothetical question: if all shorts decided to cover, while all other buyers \nstood aside and daily volume remained unchanged, how many days would it take for \nthem to cover and bring short interest down to zero? This “Days to Cover” number \nnormally oscillates between one and two days.\nWhen planning to buy or short a stock, it pays to check its Short Percent of Float \nand Days to Cover. If those are high, they show that the bearish side is overcrowded. \n",

Whether he’ll stick to his plan or attempt to tweak \nor override those signals is another story, but that’s how the system is supposed \nto work.\nAn amateur feels relieved that a mechanical system, either his own or purchased \nfrom a vendor, will relieve him from the stress of decision making. Unfortunately, \nmarket conditions keep changing, and mechanical systems eventually get out of gear \nand start losing money. The market is not a mechanical entity that follows the laws \nof physics. It is a huge crowd of people acting in accordance with imperfect laws of \nmass psychology. Mechanical methods can help, but trading decisions must take psy-\nchology into account.\nA professional trader with a mechanical system continues to monitor its perfor-\nmance like a hawk. He knows the difference between a normal drawdown and a \nperiod when a system goes out of gear and has to be shelved. A professional trader \ncan afford to use a mechanical system precisely because he is capable of discretion-\nary trading! A mechanical system is an action plan, but some degree of judgment is \nalways required, even with the best and most reliable plans.\nA discretionary trader approaches each day in the markets afresh. He tends to \nexamine more factors than a mechanical trader, weigh them differently at different \ntimes, and be more attuned to changes in current market behavior. A good discre-\ntionary system, while giving you plenty of freedom, includes several inviolate rules, \nespecially in the area of risk management.\nBoth approaches have pluses and minuses. On the plus side, mechanical trading \ncan be less emotionally tense. You build your system, turn it on, and go about your \nlife without watching every tick. On the minus side, these living and breathing mar-\nkets have a sneaky way of changing their tunes and behaving differently from how \nthey did when you built your system.\nThe main plus of discretionary trading is the openness to fresh opportunities. Its \nbiggest minus is that people’s judgment tends to slip under stress, when they become \nexcited by greed or frightened by sharp moves.\nIn my experience, mechanical traders tend to deliver more steady results, but the \nmost successful traders use discretionary methods. Your choice is likely to depend on \nyour temperament. That’s how we make some of our most important decisions in life— \nwhere to live, what career to pursue, whom to marry. Our key choices stem from the \ninnermost core of our personalities rather than rational thought. In trading, cooler \nand more obsessional people tend to gravitate toward mechanical trading, while the \nmore swashbuckling types turn to discretionary trading.\nParadoxically, at the high end of performance, these two approaches begin to \nconverge. Advanced traders combine mechanical and discretionary methods. For ex-\nample, a friend who is a died-in-the-wool mechanical trader uses three systems in \nhis hedge fund but keeps rebalancing capital allocated to each of them. He shifts mil-\nlions of dollars from System A to System B or C, and back again. In other words, his \ndiscretionary decisions augment his systematic trading.

SYSTEM TESTING, PAPER TRADING, AND THE THREE KEY DEMANDS FOR EVERY TRADE\t\n151\nline, shorting below the lower channel line, or putting on trades against the Impulse \nsystem (described below). These mechanical rules reduce the number of bad discre-\ntionary trades.\nMuch of this book deals with discretionary trading, but you can use the tools \ndescribed in it for mechanical trading. I wrote this book to help both types of \ntraders.\n■\n■38. System Testing, Paper Trading, and  \nthe Three Key Demands for Every Trade\nBefore trading real money with a system, you need to test it, whether you developed \nit yourself or bought it from a vendor. This can be done in one of two ways. One is \nbacktesting: apply your system’s rules to a stretch of historical data, usually several \nyears’ worth. The other is forward-testing: trade small positions with real money. \nSerious traders begin with backtesting, and if its results look good, switch to for-\nward-testing; if that works well, they gradually increase position size.\nLooking at printouts of historical results is a nice start, but don’t let good num-\nbers lull you into a false sense of security. The profit-loss ratio, the longest winning \nand losing streaks, the maximum drawdown, and other parameters may appear \nobjective, but past results don’t guarantee the system will hold up in the real world \nof trading.\nYou may see a very nice printout, but what if, once you begin to trade real money, \nthat system delivers five losses in a row? Nothing in your paper testing will have pre-\npared you for that, but it happens all the time. You grit your teeth and put on another \ntrade. Another loss. Your drawdown is deepening, and then the system flashes a new \nsignal. Will you put on the next trade? Suddenly, an impressive printout looks like a \nvery thin reed on which to hang the future of your account.\nThere is a cottage industry of programmers who back-test systems for a fee. Some \ntraders, too suspicious to disclose their “sure-fire methods,” spend months learning \nto use testing software. In the end, only one kind of backtesting prepares you to \ntrade—manual testing. It is slow, time-consuming, and cannot be automated, but \nit’s the only method that comes close to modeling real decision making. It consists \nof going through historical data one day at a time, scrupulously writing down your \ntrading signals for the day ahead, and then clicking one bar forward and recording \nnew signals and trades for the next day.\nBegin by downloading daily price and volume data for your trading vehicle for a \nminimum of two years (for futures you may use continuous contracts). Open a chart \nand, without looking, swing immediately to its very beginning. Open your spread-\nsheet, write down your system’s rules at the top of the page, and create columns for \ndates, prices, and signals. Open two windows in your analytic program—one for \nyour weekly chart and its indicators, the other for the daily chart. The two most im-\nportant keyboard keys for testing are <Alt> and <Tab> because they let you switch \nbetween windows and programs.\n",

At that point, you’ll be doing much more than testing a set \nof rules. Moving ahead one day at a time will test and improve your decision-making \nskills. This one-bar-at-a-time testing is vastly superior to what you can get from \nbacktesting software.\nHow will you deal with gap openings, when the market leaps above your buy level \nor drops below your stop at the opening bell? What about limit moves in futures? \nClicking forward one day at a time and writing down your signals and decisions will \nget you as close to real trading as you can without risking cash. It’ll keep you focused \non the raw right edge of the market. You’ll never get that from a neat printout of \na system test. Manual testing will improve your ability not only to understand the \nmarkets but to make decisions.\nIf one-bar-at-a-time testing shows positive results, start trading small positions \nwith real money. These days, with brokerage commissions as low as $1 for buying \nor selling 100 shares, you can test your indicators and systems while risking tiny \namounts. Be sure to keep good records, and if your real-money results continue \npositive, start increasing the size of your trades. Do it in steps, all the way up to your \nnormal trade size.\nPaper Trading\nPaper trading means recording your buy and sell decisions and tracking them like \nreal trades, but with no money at risk. Beginners may start out paper trading, but \nmost people turn to it after getting beat up by the markets. Some even alternate be-\ntween real and paper trades and can’t understand why they seem to make money on \npaper but lose whenever they put on a real trade. There are three reasons.\nFirst, people are less emotional with paper trades, and good decisions are \neasier to make with no money at risk. Second, in paper trades, you always get \nperfect fills, unlike real trading. Third and most important, good trades often \nlook murky when you consider them. The easy-looking ones are more likely to \nlead to problems. A nervous beginner jumps into obvious-looking trades and los-\nes money, but paper trades the more challenging ones. It goes without saying that \nhopping between real and paper trades is sheer nonsense. You either do the one or \nthe other.\nPsychology plays a huge role in how your trades turn out, and that’s where paper \ntrading fails to deliver. Pretend-trading with no money at risk is like sailing on a \npond—it does little to prepare you for real sailing on a stormy sea.\nThere is only one good reason to paper trade—to test your discipline as well as \nyour system.\nIf you can download your data at the end of each day, do your homework, write \ndown your orders for the day ahead, watch the opening and record your entries, \nthen track your market each day, adjusting your profit targets and stops—if you can \ndo all of this for several months in a row, recording your actions, without skipping \na day—then you have the discipline to trade real money.

At that point, I may re-\nceive an e-mail saying that while they’re doing well in the competition, their private \ntrading lags behind. I tell them they’re on the right track and to continue what \nthey’re doing. Sure enough, several months later their new skills migrate into real \ntrading. Now they may write that their private trading is better than their perfor-\nmance in the competition. Sure—I reply—it’s because you pay more attention to \nreal-money trades!\nSpeaking of trade setups, it’s essential to write down all relevant numbers before \nyou enter a trade. You’re more objective before you put any money at risk; once in a \ntrade, you’ll be tempted to give it “more room to run.” That’s how losers turn small \ndrawdowns into disasters. I once consulted a man who refused to take a $200 loss \nuntil it ran into a $98,000 wipeout.\nWe’ll focus on risk and money management in a later chapter when I discuss the \nconcept of  “The Iron Triangle of risk control.” At this point, I only want to make \nclear that risk management is the essential part of serious trading. Forget the days \nwhen you would look at the ceiling and say, “I’ll trade 500 shares,” “I’ll trade a thou-\nsand shares,” or any other arbitrary number. Later in this book, you’ll learn a simple \nformula for sizing your trades, based on your account and risk tolerance.\nAt the time of this writing, I have three strategies that I trade.

Before entering the market you need to decide how much you’ll pay, how \nmuch you’ll risk, and how much you expect to gain. The ratio of potential reward \nto risk should normally be better than two to one. The only time to deviate from \nthis rule is when technical signals are especially strong. Of course, don’t fudge your \ntarget to turn a borderline trade into an acceptable one. Your target needs to be \nrealistic.\nB.\t Risk management—decide in advance how many dollars you’re prepared to risk on \nthis trade.

This will give you the number of shares you may trade.\nC.\t Last but not least, every single trade must be based on a specific system or strategy. \n“It looks good to me” isn’t a system!

If \nthey get lucky for a while, they feel as if they discovered the royal road to riches. \nWhen the magic dies, amateurs give back their profits with interest and look for an-\nother magic tool. The markets are too complex to be analyzed with a single indicator.\nDifferent indicators give contradictory signals in the same market. Trend-following \nindicators rise during uptrends and give buy signals, while oscillators become over-\nbought and give sell signals. Trend-following indicators turn down in downtrends and \ngive signals to sell short but oscillators become oversold and give buy signals.\nTrend-following indicators are profitable when markets are moving but lead to \nwhipsaws in trading ranges. Oscillators are profitable in trading ranges, but give \npremature and dangerous signals when the markets begin to trend. Traders say: “The \ntrend is your friend,” and “Let your profits run.” They also say: “Buy low, sell high.” \nBut why sell if the trend is up? And how high is high?\nSome traders try to average out the signals of trend-following indicators and oscil-\nlators, but those votes are easy to rig. Just as Republicans and Democrats in the United \nStates keep redrawing electoral districts to create “safe” seats, traders keep selecting \nindicators that deliver the votes they want to see. If you use more trend-following \ntools, the vote will go one way, and if you use more oscillators, it’ll go the other way. \nA trader can always find a group of indicators telling him what he wants to hear.\nThe Triple Screen trading system is designed to filter out the disadvantages of \ntrend-following indicators and oscillators, while preserving their strengths.\nChoosing Timeframes—the Factor of Five\nAnother major dilemma is that the trend of any trading vehicle can be both up and \ndown at the same time, depending on what charts you use. A daily chart may show an \nuptrend, while a weekly chart shows a downtrend, and vice versa. We need a system \nto handle conflicting signals in different timeframes.\nCharles Dow, the author of the venerable Dow Theory, stated at the turn of the \ntwentieth century that the stock market had three trends. The long-term trend lasted \nseveral years, the intermediate several months, and anything shorter than that was \na minor trend. Robert Rhea, the great market technician of the 1930s, compared \nthese three trends to a tide, a wave, and a ripple. He recommended trading in the \ndirection of the tide, taking advantage of the waves, and ignoring the ripples.\n",

Computers are \ncheap, or even free; live data have created better opportunities to capitalize on faster \nmoves. We need a more flexible definition of timeframes. The Triple Screen trading \nsystem is based on the observation that every timeframe relates to the larger and \nshorter ones by approximately a factor of five (see Chapter 32).\nBegin by asking yourself, what’s your favorite timeframe. Do you prefer working \nwith the daily, 10-minute, or any other charts? Whatever timeframe is your favorite, \nthe Triple Screen calls that the intermediate timeframe. The long-term timeframe \nis one order of magnitude longer. The short-term timeframe is one order of mag-\nnitude shorter. Once you select your intermediate timeframe, you may not look at it \nuntil you examine the longer-term timeframe and make your strategic decision there.\nFor example, if you want to carry a trade for several days or weeks, then your \nintermediate timeframe is likely to be defined by the daily charts. Weekly charts are \none order of magnitude longer, and they’ll determine the long-term timeframe for \nyou. Hourly charts are one order of magnitude shorter, and they’ll determine the \nshort-term timeframe.\nDay traders who hold their positions for less than an hour can use the same prin-\nciple. For them, a 5-minute chart may define the intermediate timeframe, a 25-minute \nchart the long-term timeframe, and a 2-minute chart the short-term timeframe.\nTriple Screen demands that you examine the long-term chart first. It allows you \nto trade only in the direction of the tide—the trend on the long-term chart. It uses \nthe waves that go against the tide for entering positions. For example, when the \nweekly trend is up, daily declines create buying opportunities. When the weekly \ntrend is down, daily rallies provide shorting opportunities.\nFirst Screen—Market Tide\nTriple Screen begins by analyzing the long-term chart, one order of magnitude greater \nthan the one you plan to trade. Most traders pay attention only to the daily charts, with \neverybody watching the same few months of data. If you begin by analyzing weekly \ncharts, your perspective will be five times greater than that of your competitors.\nBegin by selecting your favorite timeframe and call it Intermediate. Do not even \nglance at your intermediate chart because it’ll prejudice you. Go immediately to \nthe timeframe one order of magnitude longer—your long-term chart. That’s where \nyou’ll make your strategic decision to be a bull or a bear. After that, return to the \nintermediate timeframe and start making tactical decisions, such as where to enter \nand where to place a stop.\nIf you make the mistake of looking at the daily chart first, you’ll be prejudiced by \nits patterns. First, make an unbiased decision on a long-term weekly chart before \neven glancing at the daily.\nThe original version of Triple Screen used the slope of weekly MACD-Histogram \nas its weekly trend-following indicator (Figure 39.1). It was very sensitive and gave \nmany buy and sell signals. Later I switched to using the slope of a weekly exponential \nmoving average as my main trend-following tool on long-term charts. After I in-\nvented the Impulse system (described in the following chapter), I began to use it for \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

It is not quite as jumpy as MACD-Histogram but is faster \nto react than the slope of an EMA.\nAs you’ll read in the next chapter, the Impulse system colors every bar green when \nit’s bullish, red when bearish, and blue when neutral. The Impulse system doesn’t tell \nyou what to do. It’s a censorship system that signals what you’re prohibited from doing. \nWhen the Impulse system is red, it prohibits you from buying. When it is green, it pro-\nhibits you from shorting. Glancing at a weekly chart when you want to buy, you have \nto wait until it stops being red. Glancing at a weekly chart when you want to sell short, \nyou have to make sure it isn’t green. The blue Impulse permits you to trade either way.\nSome traders use other indicators to identify major trends. Steve Notis wrote an \narticle in Futures magazine showing how he used the Directional System as the first \nscreen of Triple Screen. The principle is the same. You can use most trend-following \nE\nD\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 39.1  Gold weekly, with 26- and 13-EMAs and MACD-Histogram (12-26-9).  \n(Chart by Stockcharts.com)\nUsing Weekly MACD-Histogram as the First Screen of Triple Screen\nTriple Screen requires us to examine weekly charts before even looking at the dailies. The \nslope of MACD-Histogram is defined by the relationship between its two latest bars.\nThis indicator flashes a buy signal when its slope turns up and a sell signal when its \nslope turns down. The best buy signals occur when MACD-Histogram turns up from be-\nlow its centerline. The best sell signals are given when its slope turns down from above its \ncenterline (see Indicator Seasons in Chapter 32).\nWhen the slope of MACD-Histogram turns up (arrows A, C, and E), it allows us to trade \nonly from the long side or stand aside. When that slope turns down (arrows B and D), it \nallows us to trade only from the short side or stand aside.\nNote that the buy signals at A and E are of better quality than at C—because the signal \nC occurred above the centerline. It is better to buy in spring than in summer. At the right \nedge of the chart, the uptrend is very strong because the signal E came from a bullish \ndivergence: a double bottom of prices (A and E) was accompanied by a much shallower \nsecond bottom of the indicator.\n",

The first screen of the Triple \nScreen trading system takes away one of those options. It acts as a censor who per-\nmits you only to buy or stand aside during major uptrends. It allows you only to \nsell short or stand aside during major downtrends. You have to swim with the tide \nor stay out of the water.\nSecond Screen—Market Wave\nThe second screen of Triple Screen identifies the wave that goes against the tide. \nWhen the weekly trend is up, daily declines point to buying opportunities. When the \nweekly trend is down, daily rallies point to shorting opportunities.\nThe second screen applies oscillators, described in a previous section, to the daily \ncharts in order to identify deviations from the weekly trend. Oscillators give buy \nsignals when markets decline and sell signals when they rise. The second screen of \nthe Triple Screen allows you to take only those signals on the daily charts that put you \nin gear with the weekly trend.\nScreen Two: Apply an oscillator to a daily chart. Use daily declines during weekly \nuptrends to find buying opportunities and daily rallies during weekly downtrends \nto find shorting opportunities. I like using Force Index, described in chapter 30, for \nthe second screen, but other oscillators, such as RSI, Elder-ray, or Stochastic also \nperform well.\nWhen the weekly trend is up, Triple Screen takes only buy signals from daily oscil-\nlators but doesn’t short their sell signals. The 2-day EMA of Force Index gives buy \nsignals when it falls below its zero line, as long as it doesn’t fall to a new multi-week \nlow. When the weekly trend is down, Force Index gives shorting signals when it rallies \nabove its centerline, as long as it doesn’t rise to a new multi-week high (Figure 39.2).\nOther oscillators, such as Stochastic and RSI (see Chapters 26 and 27), give \ntrading signals when they enter their buy or sell zones. For example, when weekly \nMACD-Histogram rises but daily Stochastic falls below 30, it identifies an oversold \narea, a buying opportunity. When the weekly MACD-Histogram declines but daily \nStochastic rises above 70, it identifies an overbought area, a shorting opportunity.\nThird Screen—Entry Technique\nThe Third Screen is your entry technique, and here you have quite a bit of latitude. \nYou can go to an even shorter time-frame, especially if you have live data, or you can \nuse the same intermediate timeframe.\nIn the original Trading for a Living I recommended looking for a ripple in the direc-\ntion of the market tide: buying a breakout above the previous day’s high for entering \nlongs or shorting a breakdown below the previous day’s low for entering shorts.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Buying a \nbreakout above the previous day’s high and placing a stop below that day’s low could \nmean a wide stop after a wide-range day, either putting a lot of money at risk or \nreducing position size. At other times, when the pre-breakout day was very narrow, \nplacing the stop right below its low would expose that trade to the risk of being \nstopped out by market noise.\nThe breakout technique is still valid, but I seldom use it. With the wide availabil-\nity of intraday data, I like to switch to 25-minute and 5-minute charts and use day-\ntrading techniques for entering my swing trades. If you don’t have access to live data \nand need to place an order in the morning, before leaving for the day, I recommend \nan alternative approach which I call “an average EMA penetration.”\nAlmost every rally is penetrated by occasional pullbacks, and you want to mea-\nsure how deeply those pullbacks drop below your fast EMA. Look at the daily chart \nfor the past four to six weeks, and if it is in an uptrend, measure how deeply prices \npenetrate below their EMA during normal pullbacks (Figure 39.3).\nFIGURE 39.2  Gold daily, with 26- and 13-EMAs and 2-day Force Index. . (Chart by Stockcharts.com)\nDaily Force Index—the Second Screen of Triple Screen \nThe 2-day EMA of Force index is one of several oscillators that can work for the second \nscreen of the Triple Screen trading system. Force Index marks buying opportunities when \nit falls below its centerline. It marks selling opportunities when it rises above its centerline. \nWhen the weekly trend is up (marked here with a green horizontal bar), take only buy sig-\nnals from the daily oscillator for entering long positions. When the weekly trend is down \n(marked by a red horizontal bar), take only sell signals for entering short positions.\nNotice a bullish divergence, accompanied by a false downside breakout before the \nstart of the uptrend (marked with a diagonal green arrow). At the right edge of the screen, \nGold is flying, along with most gold stocks. I’m actively buying them—but not Gold ETFs. \nA Traders’ Camp graduate from Australia wrote the other day: “I bought XAU ETF but it \nis being left far behind by NCM, our biggest Gold Miner.

The U.S. stock market is open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.—six and a half hours \nor 390 minutes. Using a 39-minute chart as your long-term screen neatly divides each \nday into 10 bars. Make your strategic decision there, and then drop down to a chart \nthat’s 5 times faster—an 8-minute chart—for tactical decisions on entries and exits.\nDon’t mash together too many timeframes. If you’re swing-trading, you can briefly \nuse an intraday chart to time your entry, but then return to the daily charts. If you \nkeep watching intraday charts, chances are they’ll shake you out of the trade prema-\nturely. If you day-trade, then the weekly chart is not really relevant, but you may take \na quick look at the daily chart. The rule is this: select your favorite (intermediate) \nchart, pair it with a long-term chart that is 5 times longer, and go to work.\nStops and Profit Targets\nProper money management is essential for successful trading. A disciplined trader \ntakes his profits at targets, cuts losses short, and outperforms those who keep hoping \nand hanging on to bad trades. Before you enter a trade, write down three numbers: \nthe entry, the target, and the stop. Placing a trade without defining these three num-\nbers is gambling.\nTriple Screen calls for setting profit targets using long-term charts and stops on \nthe charts of your intermediate timeframe. If you use weekly and daily charts, set \nprofit targets on the weeklies but stops on the dailies. When buying a dip on a daily \nchart, the value zone on a weekly chart presents a good target. When day-trading \nand using a 25-minute and a 5-minute pair, set the profit target on a 25-minute chart \nand the stop on a 5-minute chart. This helps you aim at the greater results, while \nholding down the risk.\nThe Triple Screen trading system calls for placing fairly tight stops. Since it has you \ntrading in the direction of the market tide, it doesn’t give much room to losing trades. \nGet on with the tide—or get out. We’ll return to this topic in Chapter 54, “How to \nSet Stops.”\n■\n■40. The Impulse System\nThe idea for the Impulse system came to me in the mid-1990s. I woke up in the \nmiddle of the night in a faraway hotel and sat up bolt upright in bed with the thought \nthat I could describe any market move in any timeframe, using only two criteria: \ninertia and power. By combining them, I could find stocks and futures with both \nbullish inertia and bullish power and trade them long. I could also find stocks and \nfutures with both bearish inertia and power and sell them short.\nA good measure of the inertia of any trading vehicle is the slope of its fast EMA. \nA rising EMA reflects bullish inertia, while a falling EMA reflects bearish inertia. The \npower of any trend is reflected in the slope of MACD-Histogram. If its latest bar is \nhigher than the previous bar (like the height of the letters m–M) or less deep than the \nprevious bar (like the depth of the letters y–v), then the slope of MACD-Histogram \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

If the latest bar of MACD-Histogram is lower \nthan the previous one (like the depth of the letters v–y or the height of the letters \nM–m), then the slope is declining, and the power is pushing down. When we use \nMACD-Histogram to define power, it doesn’t matter whether it’s above or below \nzero: what matters is the relationship of the last two bars of MACD-Histogram.\nIt is relatively simple to program most software packages to color price bars or \ncandles using the Impulse system. If both indicators are rising, the bar is green—\nbullish. If both are falling, the bar is red—bearish. When the two indicators move \nagainst one another, that bar is blue—neutral (Figure 40.1).\nAt first, I anticipated making this system automatic—buy green, short red, and \ncash checks on all colors. Backtesting the Impulse system threw cold water on that \nidea. The automatic system caught every single trend, but it got whipsawed during \ntrading ranges, where it kept flipping between green and red.\nI set the Impulse system aside, but kept thinking about it. A few years later it \ndawned on me: this wasn’t an automatic trading system—it was a censorship sys-\ntem! It didn’t tell me what to do—it told me what not to do. If either weekly or \ndaily bar was red—no buying allowed. If either weekly or daily bar was green—no \nshorting permitted.\nEver since that discovery, I’ve been using the Impulse system for all my trades. \nI presented it to the public in my 2002 book Come into My Trading Room, which \nBarron’s named a book of the year. The Impulse system is becoming increasingly popu-\nlar worldwide, and its terminology has entered the language of trading.\nFIGURE 40.1  The colors of the Impulse system.\n■\n■\nEMA rising & MACD-Histogram rising (especially below zero) = Impulse is green, bullish.\nShorting prohibited, buying or standing aside permitted.\n■\n■\nEMA falling & MACD-Histogram falling (especially above zero) = Impulse is red, bearish.\nBuying prohibited, shorting or standing aside permitted.\n■\n■\nEMA rising & MACD-Histogram falling = Impulse is blue, neutral.

I may develop my trading plans based on any number \nof ideas, signals, or indicators—and then the Impulse system forces me to wait \nuntil it no longer prohibits an entry in the planned direction. In addition, the \nImpulse system helps me recognize when a trend starts weakening and suggests \nan exit.\nEntries\nGreen and red bars of the Impulse system show when both inertia and power are \npointing in the same direction. At a green bar, bulls are in charge and the uptrend \nis accelerating. At a red bar, bears are dominant and the downtrend is in full swing. \nA fast EMA and MACD-Histogram may stay in gear with each other for only a few \nbars, but that’s when the market travels fast—the impulse is on!\nBefore you start applying the Impulse system to your favorite market, remember \nthe Triple Screen’s insistence on analyzing markets in more than one timeframe. \nSelect your favorite timeframe and call it intermediate. Multiply it by five to define \nyour long-term timeframe. If your favorite chart is daily, analyze the weekly chart \nfirst and make a strategic decision to be a bull or a bear. Use the Impulse system to \ndecide when you’re permitted to enter long or short positions.\n■\n■If you’re a short-term momentum trader, you can buy as soon as both timeframes \nturn green and take profits as soon as one of them fades to blue.\n■\n■When trying to catch market turns, the best trading signals are given not by green \nor red but by the loss of green or red colors.\nIf a stock is falling, but your analysis indicates that a bottom is near, monitor the \nImpulse system on weekly and daily charts. If even one of them shows red, the down-\ntrend is still in force and buying is not permitted. When both timeframes stop being \nred, they allow you to buy.\nIf you think that a stock is forming a top and is about to turn down, examine the \nImpulse system on both weekly and daily charts. If even one of them is green, it’s \na sign that the uptrend is still alive, and no shorting is permitted. When the green \ndisappears from both timeframes, you may start shorting.\nThe shorter a timeframe, the more sensitive its signals: the Impulse on a daily chart \nalmost always changes colors ahead of the weekly. When day-trading, the 5-minute \nchart changes colors ahead of a 25-minute chart. If my studies show that the market \nis bottoming and getting ready to turn up, I wait until the daily chart stops being red \nand turns blue or even green; then I start watching the weekly chart, which is still \nred. As soon as it turns from red to blue, it allows me to buy. This technique saves me \nfrom buying too soon, while the market is still declining.\nI use the same approach to shorting. When I think that a top is forming and the \ndaily Impulse stops being green and turns blue or even red, I closely monitor the \nweekly chart.

Simply observe the slopes of the EMA and MACD-Histogram: their \ncombination will tell you what should be the color of the latest bar.\nIf you know how to program, you can add more features to the Impulse system. \nYou can test different EMA lengths or MACD settings, looking for those that work \nbest in your market. A day trader can program sound alarms to monitor color changes \nin several markets without being glued to the screen.\nExits\nIf you’re a short-term momentum trader, close out your trade as soon as the col-\nor of the Impulse system stops supporting the direction of your trade, even in \none of the two timeframes. Usually, the daily MACD-Histogram turns ahead of the \nweekly. When it ticks down during an uptrend, it shows that the upside momen-\ntum is weakening. When the buy signal disappears, take profits without waiting for a \nsell signal.\nReverse this procedure in downtrends. Cover shorts as soon as the Impulse sys-\ntem stops being red, even in one of the two timeframes. The most dynamic part of \nthe decline is over, and your momentum trade has fulfilled its goal.\nThe Impulse system encourages you to enter cautiously but exit fast. This is the \nprofessional approach to trading. Beginners tend to do the opposite; jump into trades \nand then take forever to exit, hoping for the market to turn their way.\nA swing trader may stay in a trade, even if one of the timeframes turns blue. What \nhe should never do is stay in a trade against the color. If you’re long, and one of the \ntimeframes turns red, it is time to sell and go back to the sidelines. If you’re short, \nand the Impulse system turns green, it signals to cover your short position.\nThe Impulse system helps identify islands of order in the ocean of market chaos by \nshowing when the crowd, usually so aimless and disorganized, becomes emotional \nand starts to run. You enter when a trend pattern emerges and exit when it starts to \nsink back into chaos.\n■\n■41. Channel Trading Systems\nMarket prices tend to flow in channels, like rivers in their valleys. When a river \ntouches the right edge of its valley, it turns left. When it touches the left rim of its \nvalley, it turns right. When prices rally, they often seem to stop at an invisible ceil-\ning. Their declines seem to stop at invisible floors. Channels help us anticipate where \nthose support and resistance levels are likely to be encountered.\nSupport is where buyers buy with greater intensity than sellers sell. Resistance is \nwhere sellers sell with greater intensity than buyers buy (see Chapter 18). Channels \nshow where to expect support and resistance in the future.\nChannels help identify buying and selling opportunities and avoid bad trades. The \noriginal research into trading channels was conducted by J. M. Hurst and described \nin his 1970 book, The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

CHANNEL TRADING SYSTEMS\t\n167\nThe late great mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot was hired by the Egyptian gov-\nernment to create a mathematical model of cotton prices—the main agricultural \nexport of that country. After extensive study, the scientist made this finding: “prices \noscillate above and below value.” It may sound simple, but in fact it’s profound. If \nwe accept this mathematical finding and if we have the means to define value and \nmeasure an average oscillation, we’ll have a trading system. We’ll need to buy below \nvalue and take profits at value or sell short above value and cover at value.\nWe have already agreed that value is in the zone between a short and a long mov-\ning averages. We can use channels to find normal and abnormal oscillations.\nTwo Ways to Construct a Channel\nWe may construct a channel by plotting two lines parallel to a moving average: one \nabove and another below. We may also vary the distance between the channel lines \ndepending on that market’s volatility (standard deviation channels).\nA symmetrical channel, centered around a moving average, is useful for trading \nstocks and futures. A standard deviation channel (sometimes called Bollinger bands) \nis good for those who trade options.\nChannels mark the boundaries between normal and abnormal price action. It is \nnormal for prices to stay inside a well-drawn channel, and only unusual events push \nthem outside. The market is undervalued below its lower channel line and overval-\nued above its upper channel line.\nSymmetrical Channels\nEarlier we’ve discussed using a set of two moving averages for trading (see Chapter \n22). With such a pair, use the slower one as the backbone of your channel. For ex-\nample, if you use 13-day and 26-day EMAs, draw your channel lines parallel to the \n26-day EMA.\nThe width of a channel depends on the coefficient selected by the trader. This \ncoefficient is usually expressed as a percentage of the EMA level.\nUpper Channel Line = EMA + Channel Coefficient • EMA\nLower Channel Line = EMA − Channel Coefficient • EMA\nWhen setting a channel for any market, start with 3% or 5% of the EMA and \nkeep adjusting those values until a channel contains approximately 95 percent of all \nprice data for the past 100 bars, about five months on a daily chart. This is similar to \ntrying on a shirt: you look for the one that fits not too loose or too tight, with only \nyour wrists and neck sticking out. Only the extreme prices will protrude outside of \na well-drawn channel.\nVolatile markets require wider channels, while quiet markets require more nar-\nrow channels. Cheaper stocks tend to have higher coefficients than expensive ones. \nLong-term charts require wider channels. As a rule of thumb, weekly channel coef-\nficients are twice as large as daily ones.\n",

It automatically plots correct channels \nfor any trading vehicle in any timeframe (Figure 41.1). It’s included on elder-disks \nfor several popular programs.\nMass Psychology\nAn exponential moving average reflects the average consensus of value in its time \nwindow. When prices are near their moving average, the market is fairly valued. When \nthey decline near the lower channel line, the market is undervalued. When prices rise \nto the upper channel line, the market is overvalued. Channels help find buying oppor-\ntunities when the market is cheap and shorting opportunities when the market is dear.\nWhen prices fall below their moving average, bargain hunters step in. Their buy-\ning as well as short covering by bears stops declines and lifts prices. When prices rise \nabove value, sellers see an opportunity to take profits on long positions or go short. \nTheir selling caps the rise.\nWhen the market sinks to the bottom of a depression, its mood is about to im-\nprove. Once it rises to the height of its mania, it’s about to start calming down. A \nchannel marks normal limits of mass optimism and pessimism.

Futures are much more transparent and true than the murky forex deals. When-\never I trade currencies, I use currency futures.\nWarren Buffet refers to the stock market as a manic-depressive fellow, and his descrip-\ntion applies to non-equity markets. Here you see the Euro swinging above and below \nvalue. When it rises above the upper channel line, it shows that the market has become \nmanic (marked with a letter M), and when it falls below the lower channel line, it is de-\npressed (marked with a letter D).\nBuffett observes that the trouble with most people is that they become infected by the \nmood of Mr. Market—they want to buy when he is manic and sell when he’s depressed. \nPlotting a channel helps you diagnose the market’s mania and depression and avoid be-\ncoming infected by either. One of my strict rules is never to buy above the upper channel \nline or sell short below the lower channel line. I may miss a runaway trend because of this \nrestriction, but my safety is greatly increased. At the right edge of the screen, the Euro is \nrising very near its upper channel line—it looks like a manic episode is about to develop.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

When an amateur sees a breakout, he \nexpects riches from a major new trend.\nProfessionals, on the other hand, tend to trade against deviations and for a return \nto normalcy. The pros know that most breakouts are exhaustion moves that are soon \naborted. That’s why they like to fade breakouts—trade against them, selling short \nas soon as an upside breakout stalls and buying when a downside breakout starts \nreturning into the range.\nBreakouts can produce spectacular gains when a major new trend blows out of a \nchannel, but in the long run it pays to trade with the pros. Most breakouts fail and are \nfollowed by reversals, which is why channel lines mark attractive zones for entering \ntrades against breakouts, with profit targets in the value zone.\nYou can use moving-average channels as a stand-alone trading method or combine \nit with other techniques. Gerald Appel, a prominent market researcher and money \nmanager in New York, recommended these rules for trading with channels:\n1.\tDraw a moving average and build a channel around it. When a channel is rela-\ntively flat, the market is almost always a good buy near the bottom of its trading \nchannel and a good sell near the top.\n2.\tWhen the trend turns up and a channel rises sharply, an upside penetration of the \nupper channel line shows very strong bullish momentum. It indicates that you \nwill probably have one more chance to sell in the area of the highs that are being \nmade. It is normal for the market to return to its moving average after an upside \npenetration, offering an excellent buying opportunity. Sell your long position \nwhen the market returns to the top of the channel.\nThis also works in reverse during sharp downtrends. A breakout below the lower \nchannel line indicates that a pullback to the moving average is likely to occur, offer-\ning another opportunity to sell short. When prices return to the lower channel line, \nit is time to cover shorts.\nThe best trading signals are given by a combination of channels and other techni-\ncal indicators (Figure 41.3). Indicators give some of their strongest signals when \nthey diverge from prices. A method for combining channels and divergences was \ndescribed to me by the late Manning Stoller.\n1.\tA sell signal is given when prices reach the upper channel line while an indicator, \nsuch as MACD-Histogram, traces a bearish divergence. It shows that bulls are \nbecoming weak when prices are overextended.\n2.\tA buy signal is given when prices reach the lower channel line while an indicator \ntraces a bullish divergence. It shows that bears are becoming weak when prices \nare already low.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

A narrow band identifies a sleepy, quiet market. Major market moves \ntend to erupt from flat bases. Bollinger bands help identify transitions from quiet to \nactive markets.\nThese bands are useful for options traders because option prices are largely driven \nby swings in volatility. Narrow Bollinger bands help you buy when volatility is low \nand options are relatively cheap. Wide bands help you decide to write options when \nvolatility is high and options are expensive.\nWhen we return to options in the following chapters, you’ll read that buying \noptions is a losers’ game. Professional traders write options. Wide Bollinger Bands \ncan signal when to be more active with your writes.

ETFs\nAn exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that trades like a stock. \nDifferent ETFs hold different types of assets, such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, \nand they usually trade close to their net asset values. There are ETFs designed to \ntrack indexes, sectors, countries, commodities, bonds, futures, and forex. The lev-\neraged ETFs are designed to move double or triple the distance of the underlying \nindex. There are also inverse ETFs and leveraged inverse ETFs that trade opposite to \ntheir underlying assets: when an index falls, its inverse ETF rises and vice versa. The \nnumber of ETFs has reached thousands in recent years.\nWith so many choices, what’s there not to like about ETFs? Actually, quite a lot.\nThe industry keeps quiet about the fact that there are two ETF markets. The pri-\nmary market is reserved for “authorized participants”—large broker-dealers who \nhave agreements with the ETF distributors to buy or sell large blocks, consisting of \ntens of thousands of ETF shares. These middlemen buy at wholesale and then sell to \nyou at retail. You, as a private trader, always sit in the back of the bus—in the second-\nary market.\nAn active trader friend who reviewed this chapter added: “I believe that ‘autho-\nrized participants’ can also obtain ETF shares to short in large lots. My broker always \ntells me there are none available, not even of broadly held ETFs, which I can’t imag-\nine they don’t have lots of in inventory. When I ask them about this, they stonewall. \nI wonder how such a shorting transaction by an authorized participant is accounted \nfor. I wonder if it somehow ends up as paired transactions (both an up-volume pur-\nchase and a down-volume sale, cancelling each other out). If so, the added selling \npressure would be hidden from view.”\nAdministrative expenses incurred by ETFs dampen investors’ returns. Accord-\ning to a study by Morgan Stanley, ETFs missed their 2009 targets by an average of \n1.25%, which was double the size of their “miss” in 2008. Those percentages are \nyour “haircuts” for the privilege of trading ETFs rather than individual stocks.

I stopped trading country ETFs after running into several situa-\ntions in which a country index would rise to a new high, while my ETF would stay \nwell below the breakout level (Figure 43.2).\nThe leveraged ETFs are more “futures-laden” than non-leveraged ETFs and have \nmuch greater rollover losses each month.

For example, if a market drops sharply, reducing the value of calls, the \nincreased volatility will lift option values, and the calls may lose less than expected. \nThere are several mathematical models, such as Black-Scholes, widely described in \noptions literature, that are used to determine what is called a fair value of any option.\nBuying Options\nThe simplest and easiest approach to options is to buy them. That’s exactly what \nbeginners do, and unless they learn quickly and change, their accounts are doomed.\nThis is the standard line of brokerage house propaganda: “Options offer lever-\nage—an ability to control large positions with a small outlay of cash. The entire risk \nof an option is limited to the price you pay for it. Options allow traders to make \nmoney fast when they’re right, but if the market reverses, you can walk away and \nowe nothing!”  They fail to mention that in order to profit from buying an option you \nmust be right in three ways. You must choose the right stock, predict the extent of \nits move, and forecast how fast it’ll get there. If you’re wrong on even one of these \nthree choices, you’ll lose money.\nEver tried tossing a ball through three rings at an amusement park? This triple \ncomplexity makes buying options a losing game.\nA stock, an index, or a future can do one of three things: rise, fall, or stay flat. \nWhen you buy a call, you can profit only if the market rises; you lose if it goes down \nor stays flat. You can lose even if it rises, but not fast enough. When you buy a put, \nyou win only if the market falls fast enough. An option buyer makes money only if \nthe market goes his way at a good enough speed, but loses if it moves his way slowly, \nstays flat, or goes against him.\nAn option buyer has one chance out of three to win—but the odds are two out of \nthree in favor of an option writer. No wonder the pros write options. A pro sells a \ncall, and if a stock drops, stays flat, or even rises slowly, that call will expire worth-\nless, and he’ll keep the premium. He sells poor buyers hope—and as that hope turns \nout to be worthless, he keeps their money.\nOptions attract hordes of small traders who can’t afford to buy stocks. To get a \nbigger bang for their buck, they buy calls as if those were substitutes for stocks. This \ndoesn’t work because options move differently from stocks. Gullible amateurs buy \nempty hopes, which the pros are delighted to sell to them.\nBeginners, gamblers, and undercapitalized traders make up the majority of option \nbuyers. Just think of all the money those hapless folks lose in their eagerness to get \nrich quick. Who gets all that money? Some of it goes for brokerage commissions, \nbut the bulk flows into the pockets of option writers. Well-capitalized professionals \nwrite options rather than buy them. Option writing is a capital-intensive business: \nyou need hundreds of thousands of dollars at a minimum to do it right, and most suc-\ncessful writers operate with millions. Writing options is a serious game for knowl-\nedgeable, disciplined, and well-capitalized traders. If your account is too small for \noption writing, wait until it grows bigger.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Options are a great example of this rule.\nWriting Options\nThere are two main types of option writing. Covered writers buy a stock and write \noptions against it. Naked writers write calls and puts on stocks they don’t own.\nCovered writers own underlying securities. For example, a fund may hold a \nlarge position in IBM stock and sell calls against it. If the stock doesn’t rise to the \nexercise price during the life of those calls, the options will expire worthless. The \ncovered writer will add his premium to the fund and write a new call with a new \nexpiration date. If IBM does rise to the exercise price and “gets called,” they’ll deliver \ntheir stock at its strike price, collect the money, and use the freed-up capital to buy \nanother stock and write calls against it.\nLarge funds tend to use computerized models for buying stocks and writing cov-\nered calls. Covered writing is a mathematically demanding, capital-intensive busi-\nness. Most serious players spread their costs, including staff and equipment, across \na large capital base. A small trader doesn’t have much of an edge in this expensive \nenterprise. Covered writing was very profitable in the early years of exchange-traded \noptions. By now the field is very crowded, and the returns have become thinner.\nNaked writers sell options without owning their underlying securities; they back \nup their writes with cash in their accounts. A naked writer collects his premium when \nhe opens a trade, but his risk is unlimited if that position goes against him. If you own \na stock, sell a covered call, and that stock rises to its exercise price and gets called, \nyou have something to deliver. If you sell a naked call and the stock rises to or above \nits exercise price, you’ll have to pay. Imagine selling calls on a stock that becomes a \ntakeover play and opens $50 higher the next morning—you still have to deliver.\nThis combination of limited rewards with unlimited risks scares most traders \naway from naked writing—but as usual, there’s a gap between perception and real-\nity. A far-out-of-the-money option with a short time to the expiration is very likely \nto expire worthless, meaning the writer will profit. The risk/reward ratio in naked \nwriting is better than it looks, and there are techniques for reducing the impact of a \nrare adverse move.\nSavvy naked writers tend to sell out-of-the-money calls and puts whose underly-\ning stocks or futures are unlikely to reach their strike prices during the remaining life \nof an option. They sell not just hopes but distant hopes. Good writers track volatility \nto find how far a stock is likely to move and then sell options outside of that range. \nThis game goes into high gear during the week or two prior to option expiration, \nwhen the floor mints money out of thin air, selling naked puts and calls that have \nalmost no chance of reaching their exercise price.\nCautious writers close their positions without waiting for the expiration dates. \nIf you write a call at 90 cents and it goes down to 10 cents, it makes sense to buy it \n",

It’s cheaper to pay another commission, \nbook your profits, and look for another writing opportunity.\nBecoming a naked writer requires iron discipline. The size of your writes and the \nnumber of positions must be strictly determined by your money management rules. \nIf you sell a naked call and the stock rallies above its exercise price, it exposes you to \nthe risk of ruin. You must decide in advance at what level you will cut and run, tak-\ning a relatively small loss. A naked seller cannot afford to sit and hope when a stock \nmoves against him.\nWriter’s Choice\nTime is the enemy of options buyers. Every buyer has lived through this sad se-\nquence: they buy a call, the stock rises, but their option fades to zero, and they lose \nmoney. Buyers lose when the underlying security takes longer than expected to get \nto the level at which they can collect on their bet. Most options become worthless \nby their expiration date.\nWhat if we reverse this process and write rather than buy options? The first time \nyou write an option, and do it correctly, you’ll experience the delicious sensation of \ntime working in your favor. The option that you wrote loses some of its time value \neach day, making the premium you’ve collected safer. When the market goes no-\nwhere, you still make money, as time value keeps evaporating, making it more likely \nthat you’ll keep the premium.\nIf living well is the best revenge, then taking a factor that kills most options \nbuyers—time—and making it work for you is a gratifying experience.\nSince each option represents a hope, it’s better to sell empty hopes which are \nunlikely to be fulfilled. Take three steps before writing a call or a put:\n1.\tAnalyze the security against which you want to write options.\nUse Triple Screen to decide whether a stock, future, or an index is trending or \nnon-trending. Use weekly and daily charts, trend-following indicators, and oscil-\nlators to identify trends, detect reversals, and set up price targets. Avoid writing \nwhen earnings are about to be announced—do not hold open positions during \nthose potentially stormy days.\n2.\tSelect the type of option to write.\nIf your analysis is bearish, consider writing calls, but if bullish, consider writing \nputs. When the trend is up, sell the hope that it will turn down, and when it’s \ndown, sell the hope it’ll turn up. Do not write options when markets are flat and \npremiums low—a breakout from a trading range can hurt you.\n3.\tEstimate how far, with a generous safety margin, the stock would have to run in \norder to change its trend. Write an option beyond that level.\nWrite an option with a strike price the market is unlikely to reach before the \noption expiration. An objective tool that shows the degree of safety of your \nplanned position is an indicator called Delta, which we’ll discuss below.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Like a boulder rolling \ndownhill, time decay becomes vertical at the final cliff.\nTime decay is bad for option buyers, but very good for option writers. You collect \nyour premium the day you sell a call. The deeper it falls below the price at which you \nwrote it, the safer your premium. Time decay is a friend of the option writer but an \nenemy of the option buyer.\nWith that in mind, the sweet spot for an option writer is approximately two to \nthree months from option expiration. That’s when time decay starts gathering speed. \nIt accelerates in the last few weeks of the option’s life. When you write options close \nto the expiration, you benefit from faster time decay. You can get more money for \noptions with longer lives, but don’t be greedy. The goal of a writer is not to make a \nkilling on any single trade but to grind out steady income.\nDelta is a tool that shows the probability of the underlying security reaching your \noption’s exercise price by its expiration date. It’s one of several options tools, col-\nlectively called the “Greeks” (each is named after a letter of the Greek alphabet). You \ncan find Delta for any stock, index, or ETF on many financial websites, especially \nthose of brokerages that offer options services.\nA cautious option writer should aim to sell calls or puts whose Delta isn’t much \nabove 0.10, meaning there is only a 10% chance of the exercise price getting hit be-\nfore the expiration date. Remember, as an option writer you don’t want the under-\nlying security to reach that price: you want to sell empty hopes. If 10% risk seems \nhigh, keep in mind that Delta is derived without any reference to market analysis. If \nyour decision is based on good technical analysis, your risk will be lower than what \nDelta indicates.\nThe temptation to sell naked options closer to the money and get fatter premiums \nis dangerous. The Delta is likely to be high, meaning that a slight counter-trend move \ncan push your position underwater. If you’re going to write options, treat it like \nwriting accident insurance policies. To make steady profits and sleep well at night, \nsell your auto insurance policies to ladies who only drive to supermarkets rather than \nto motorcycle daredevils.\nLimiting Risk\nA big options trader shared with me his technique of  “slicing the bid-ask spread.” \nHe puts in a low bid or a high ask and then starts giving up a penny at a time until \nsomebody bites. For example, he recently saw an option he wanted to write (i.e., \nsell). The bid was $1.18 and the ask $1.30, but he had no intention of selling at $1.18 \nand paying that huge spread. Instead, he put in his order to sell a large number of \ncontracts at $1.29, a penny cheaper than the ask. No response. A few minutes later \nhe lowered his ask to $1.28—and suddenly a buyer materialized, snapped up his \ncontracts, and then the bid-ask spread went back to $1.18/$1.30. My client finds \nthere are large traders watching from the sidelines, not showing their hand, but will-\ning to trade within the spread. He gets them to bite by giving up a penny at a time.\n",

      "text": "184\t\nTRADING VEHICLES\nOption writers can get hurt in one of three ways. Some overtrade, creating posi-\ntions that are too large for their accounts. Assuming too much risk makes them ner-\nvous and unable to hold positions through any wiggles. Option writers also get hurt \nwhen they fail to run fast enough when an option moves against them. Finally, option \nwriters can get blown out if they don’t have a reserve against a major adverse move. \nThe longer you trade, the greater the risk of a catastrophic event.\nA writer can grow careless selling naked options and pocketing profits. A smug \nfeeling of self-satisfaction can blind him to reality. You must protect all trades, includ-\ning naked options. Several suggestions:\n■\n■Set your profit-taking zone—consider buying back your naked options.\nThe option you write is a wasting asset. When the underlying security moves far \nfrom the exercise price but there is still time left to the expiration, the price of \nthe option you sold may fall near its rock bottom and lose value in tiny dribs and \ndrabs. The loser who bought that option still has a bit of a chance that the market \nmay reverse in his favor. He continues to hold that option like a lottery ticket—\nand once in a rare while his ticket may win.\nAs a writer, why hold an open position that has already given you most of its po-\ntential profit? You have little to gain, while remaining exposed to risk. After the op-\ntion you sold loses half of its value, consider buying it back to close your profitable \ntrade. By the time an option loses 80% of its value, you should be out of that trade.\n■\n■Use a mental stop-loss on the option you sold.\nIt is better to use mental stops here because many pros go fishing for stops of \nthinly traded options. Using mental stops requires iron discipline—another rea-\nson why option writing isn’t a beginners’ game.\nSet your mental stops both on the underlying security and the option itself. \nFor example, you may sell a naked April 80 call on a stock trading at 70 and place \nyour mental stop at 75. Get out of your naked option position before it gets into \nthe money. Also, set a stop on your option: if it doubles in price, buy it back to \ncut the loss. If you sold an option for $1.50, buy it back if it rises to $3. It may \nhurt, but it’ll be nowhere near the “unlimited loss” that makes people afraid to \nwrite options.\n■\n■Open an insurance account.\nYou may write a put and the market crashes the next day, or you write a call and \nsuddenly there is a takeover. You hope this never happens—but trade long enough \nand eventually everything will happen! That’s why you need insurance. Nobody \nwill write it for you, so you’ll have to self-insure.\nOpen a money market account, and every time you close out a profitable naked \nwriting position, throw 10 percent of your profit into that account. Do not use \nit for trading—let your insurance account grow with each new profit, ready to \ncover a catastrophic loss or to be taken out in cash when you stop writing options. \nIn a recent consultation with a professional option writer, I recommended that he \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

If you buy a CFD and the price of the underlying vehicle rises, \nyou’ll collect the difference from the company that sold you the contract, but if it \nfalls, you’ll pay the difference. CFDs are derivatives that allow speculators to bet on \nrallies or declines. They are similar to spread betting, which is legal in the United \nKingdom and Ireland, but not in the United States.\nAt the time of this writing, CFDs are available in Australia, Canada, France, Ger-\nmany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Po-\nland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United \nKingdom. They are prohibited in the United States, due to restrictions by the Securi-\nties and Exchange Commission.\nCFDs were invented in the early 1990s by Brian Keelan and Jon Wood, both of \nUBS Warburg in London. Institutional traders began using them to hedge stock ex-\nposure and to avoid taxes. In the late 1990s, several firms began marketing CFDs to \nretail traders, touting their leverage and the exemption from UK taxes. Several pro-\nvider firms expanded their offerings from the London Stock Exchange to global \nstocks, commodities, bonds, and currencies. Index CFDs, based on the major global \nindexes such as Dow Jones, S&P 500, FTSE, and DAX, quickly became the most \npopular vehicles of the group.\nCFDs are contracts between individual traders and providers, who may offer dif-\nferent deal terms. Each CFD is created by opening a trade with a provider, based on \nsome underlying instrument. Be prepared to pay large bid-ask spreads, commissions, \nand overnight financing. Trades are mostly short-term, although positions can be \ntaken overnight. Financing charges and profits or losses are credited or debited daily. \nCFDs are traded on margin.\nAmong the pluses of CFDs are the tiny minimum sizes of those contracts, mak-\ning them accessible to small traders. The absence of the expiration dates means \nthere is no time decay. While financing is charged on long positions, it is paid out \non short positions.\nThere are several serious misgivings about the CFDs. Commissions tend to be \nhigh relative to contract sizes. Bid-ask spreads are controlled by CFD issuers, who \nalso control prices of contracts, which may deviate from prices of the underlying \nsecurities. In other words, a retail customer plays against a professional team that can \nmove the goal posts during the game.\nA client from New Zealand wrote: “Regarding CFDs and spread betting, it is \nworth understanding that with CFDs you are not just trying to beat the market but \nthe casino too. CFD providers can set whatever prices they like for an instrument, as \nit is their instrument. The fact that sometimes it emulates what happens in the stock \nmarket does not mean it is the same as trading in the stock market.”\nCFDs are heavily marketed to new and inexperienced traders, extolling their po-\ntential gains, while glossing over risks. The Australian financial regulator ASIC con-\nsiders trading CFDs riskier than gambling on horses or in casinos. CFDs are banned \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Their analysis may be correct—gold may rise \nto its target price—but the beginner is doomed because he commits too much of his \nequity and has very thin reserves. Futures don’t kill traders—poor money manage-\nment kills futures traders.\nFutures can be very attractive for traders with strong money-management skills. \nHigh rates of return demand ice-cold discipline. A beginner is better off with slower-\nmoving stocks. Once you’ve matured as a trader, you can take a closer look at fu-\ntures. Also, read some introductory books. Winning in the Futures Market by George \nAngell is a good primer, to be followed by The Futures Game by Teweles and Jones.\nHedging\nFutures markets serve an important economic function: they permit commercial \nproducers and consumers to hedge commodity price risks, giving them a competi-\ntive advantage. At the same time, futures offer speculators a gambling palace with \nmore choices than any casino.\nHedging means opening a futures position opposite to one’s position in the actual \ncommodity. For example, a major candy manufacturer knows months in advance \nhow much sugar the firm is going to need. He buys a corresponding number of sugar \nfutures in New York or London when prices are good enough for the firm. They’ll be \nneeding trainloads of sugar several months from now, but meanwhile they hold sugar \nfutures, which they plan to sell when they buy their cargoes.\nIf sugar prices go up and they have to pay more for the raw commodity, they will \noffset that loss by making roughly the same profit on their futures position. If sugar \nprices fall, they’ll lose money on their futures contracts but make it up in savings on \nthe raw materials. Their unhedged competitors are taking chances. If sugar prices \nfall, they’ll buy on the cheap and reap a windfall, but if prices rise, they’ll be hung \nout to dry. Hedged consumers can concentrate on running their core businesses, \ninsulated from future price swings. Airlines know years in advance how much jet fuel \nthey’ll need, and buying oil futures protects them from price spikes that often occur \nin this volatile market.\nProducers of commodities also benefit from hedging. An agribusiness can presell \nits wheat, coffee, or cotton when prices are high enough to assure profits. They sell \nshort enough futures contracts to cover the size of their prospective crop. From that \npoint on, they have no price risk. If prices go down, they’ll make up their losses on \ncash commodity by profits on short futures trades. If prices go up, they’ll lose money \non their short futures positions but make it back selling the actual commodity at \nhigher prices.\nHedging removes price risk from planning to buy or to deliver a cash commodity. \nIt allows commercial interests to concentrate on their core businesses, offer stable \nconsumer pricing, and obtain a long-term competitive advantage.\nHedgers give up a chance of a windfall but insulate themselves from price risks. \nSurvivors value stability.

Hedgers are the \nultimate insiders, and a good hedging department not only buys price insurance, but \nalso serves as a profit center.\nHedgers transfer price risks to speculators who enter the markets, lured by the \nglitter of potential profits. It’s ironic that hedgers, who have inside information, are \nnot fully confident about prices, while crowds of cheerful outsiders plunk down \nmoney to bet on futures.\nThe two largest groups of speculators are farmers and engineers. Farmers \nproduce commodities, while engineers love to apply scientific methods to the \nfutures game. Many farmers enter futures markets as hedgers but catch the bug \nand start speculating. It never ceases to amaze me how many farmers end up trad-\ning stock index futures. As long as they trade corn, cattle, or soybeans, their feel \nfor the fundamentals gives them an edge over city slickers. But what’s their edge \nin the S&P500?\nSupply, Demand, and Seasonality\nMajor bull and bear markets in futures are driven by supply or demand. Supply-\ndriven markets tend to be fast and furious, while demand-driven markets tend to be \nquiet and slow. Why? Think of any commodity, say coffee, which grows in Africa and \nSouth America.\nChanges in demand come slowly, thanks to the conservatism of human nature. \nThe demand for coffee can increase only if drinking becomes more popular, with an \nespresso machine in every bar. The demand can fall off if coffee drinking becomes \nless popular, due to a deteriorating economy or in response to a health fad. Demand-\ndriven markets move at a leisurely pace.\nNow imagine that a major coffee growing area is hit by a hurricane or a freeze. \nSuddenly the world supply of coffee is rumored to be reduced by 10% and prices \nshoot up, cutting off marginal consumers. Imagine a new OPEC policy sharply cur-\ntailing crude oil supply or a general strike in a leading copper-mining country. When \na commodity’s supply is reduced or even rumored to be reduced, its price climbs, \nreallocating tight supplies to those best able to afford them.\nGrain prices often spike during spring and summer planting and growing seasons, \nas dry spells, floods, and pests threaten supplies. Traders say that a farmer loses his \ncrop three times before harvesting it. Once the harvest is in and the supply is known, \ndemand becomes the driving force. Demand-driven markets have narrower chan-\nnels, with smaller profit targets, and lower risks. As seasons change, channels have \nto be redrawn, and trading tactics adjusted. A new trader may wonder why his tools \nstopped working. A smart trader gets out a new set of tools for the season and puts \nold ones in storage until next year—just as he swaps regular and snow tires on his \ncar.\nA futures trader must know the key supply and demand factors of the market he’s \ntrading. For example, he must keep an eye on the weather during the critical grow-\ning and harvesting months in agricultural commodities.

FUTURES\t\n191\nmarkets tend to look for supply-driven markets, while swing traders can do just as \nwell in demand-driven markets.\nMost commodities fluctuate through the seasons. Freezing spells in the United \nStates are bullish for heating oil futures. Orange juice futures used to have wild run-\nups during the frost season in Florida, but have become much more sedate due to the \nincrease of orange production in Brazil in the Southern hemisphere. Seasonal trades \ntake advantage of such swings, but you have to be careful because those cycles are \nseldom identical. Be sure to put your seasonal trades through the filter of technical \nanalysis.\nFloors and Ceilings\nCommodities, unlike stocks, rarely trade below certain price floors or above price \nceilings. The floor depends on the cost of production. When the price of a commod-\nity, be it gold or sugar, falls below that level, miners stop digging and farmers stop \nplanting. Some third-world governments, desperate for dollars and trying to avoid \nsocial unrest, may subsidize production, paying locals in a worthless local currency \nand dumping their product on the world market. Still, if enough producers close up \nand quit, the supply will shrink, and prices will have to rise to draw in new suppliers. \nIf you look at a 20-year chart of most commodities, you’ll see that the same price \nareas have served as a floor year after year.\nThe ceiling depends on the cost of substitution. If the price of a commodity rises, \nmajor industrial consumers will start switching away from it. If soybean meal, a ma-\njor animal feed, becomes too expensive, the demand will switch to fishmeal, and if \nsugar becomes too costly, the demand will switch to corn sweeteners.\nWhy don’t more people trade against those levels? Why don’t they buy near the \nfloor and short near the ceiling, profiting from what is similar to shooting fish in a \nbarrel? First of all, neither the floor nor the ceiling is set in stone, and markets may \nbriefly violate them. Even more importantly, the human nature works against those \ntrades. Most speculators don’t have the courage to short a market that’s boiling near \nrecord highs or go long a market after it has crashed.\nContango, Inversion, and Spreads\nAll futures markets offer several contracts for different delivery months. For ex-\nample, you can buy or sell wheat for delivery in September or December of this year, \nMarch of next year, and so on. Normally, the nearby months are cheaper than the \nremote ones, and that relationship is called a contango market.\nHigher prices for more remote deliveries reflect the “cost of carry”—financing, \nstoring, and insuring a commodity. The differences between delivery months are \ncalled premiums, and hedgers closely watch them. When supply tightens or demand \nincreases, people start paying up for the nearby months, and the premium for the \nfaraway months begins to shrink. Sometimes the front months become more expen-\nsive than faraway months—the market becomes inverted! There is a real shortage \n",

This so-called “inver-\nsion” is one of the strongest signs of a bull market in a commodity.\nWhen you look for inversions, keep in mind that there is one market in which in-\nversion is the norm. Interest rate futures are always inverted because those who hold \ncash positions keep collecting interest instead of paying finance and storage charges.\nProfessionals don’t wait for inversions—they monitor the narrowing or widening \nof premiums. A good speculator can rattle off the latest prices, but a floor trader will \nquote you the latest premiums. A savvy trader knows by heart the normal spreads \nbetween different delivery months.\nHedgers tend to dominate the short side of the markets, most speculators are \nperpetual bulls, but floor traders love to trade spreads. Spreading means buying one \ndelivery month and selling another in the same market. It also means going long one \nmarket while shorting a related one.\nIf the price of corn, a major animal feed, starts to rise faster than the price of \nwheat, at some point ranchers will start using wheat rather than corn. They’ll reduce \ntheir purchases of corn, while buying more wheat, pushing their spread back to-\nwards the norm. Spread traders bet against deviations and for a return to normalcy. \nIn this situation, a spreader will short corn and buy wheat, instead of taking a direc-\ntional trade in either market.\nSpread trading is safer than directional trading and has lower margin require-\nments. Amateurs do not understand spreads and have little interest in these reliable \nbut slow-moving trades. There is not a single book on spreads I can recommend, a \nsign of how well professionals have sown up this area of knowledge and kept the out-\nsiders out. This is one of a handful of niches in the markets where professionals are \nearning high incomes without the benefit of a single good how-to book.\nCommitments of Traders\nBrokers report their clients’ positions to the Commodity Futures Trading Commis-\nsion (CFTC), which strips away personal data and releases summaries to the public. \nTheir Commitments of Traders (COT) reports are among the best sources of infor-\nmation on what the smart money is doing in the futures markets.\nCOT reports reveal positions of three groups—hedgers, big traders, and small \ntraders. Hedgers identify themselves to brokers because that entitles them to sev-\neral advantages, such as lower margin deposits. Big traders are those who hold the \nnumber of contracts above the “reporting requirements,” set by the government. \nWhoever is not a hedger or a big trader is a small trader.\nIn the old days, big traders used to be the smart money. Today, the markets are \nbigger, the reporting requirements much higher, and big traders are likely to be com-\nmodity funds, most of them not smarter than run of the mill traders. The hedgers \nare today’s smart money, but understanding their positions isn’t as easy as it seems.\nFor example, a COT report may show that in a certain market, hedgers hold 70% \nof shorts. A beginner who thinks this is bearish may be completely off the mark if \nhe doesn’t know that normally hedgers hold 90% of shorts in that market, making \nthe 70% stance wildly bullish.

If you \nfind that in a certain market the smart money is overwhelmingly on one side, while \nthe small specs are mobbing the other, it is time to use technical analysis to look for \nentries on the side of hedgers.\nMargins and Risk Control\nFutures’ low margin requirements make them more rewarding than stocks but also \nmuch more dangerous. When buying stocks in the United States, you must put up \nat least half of their cash value with the broker giving you a margin loan for the rest. \nIf you have $40,000 in your account, you may buy $80,000 worth of stocks, and no \nmore. This margin limit was implemented after the Crash of 1929 when it became \nclear that low margins led to excessive speculation, which contributed to the vi-\nciousness of declines. Prior to 1929, speculators could buy stocks on a 10% margin, \nwhich worked great in bull markets but forced them to liquidate when prices slid, \npushing the market lower during bear markets.\nMargins of only three to five percent are common in the futures markets, allowing \ntraders to make huge bets with little money. With $40,000 in your account, you may \ncontrol about a million dollars’ worth of merchandise, be it pork bellies or stock \nindex futures.\nFor example, if gold trades at $1,500/oz and you buy a 100-oz contract on a \n$7,500 margin and catch a $75 price move, you’ll gain 100%. A beginner looks at \nthese numbers and exclaims, “where have I been all my life?” He thinks he’s found \na royal road to riches. But there is a catch. Before that market rises $75, it may dip \n$50. That meaningless blip will trigger a margin call and force a small speculator’s \naccount to go bust—despite his correct forecast.\nEasy margins attract adrenaline junkies who quickly go up in smoke. Futures are \nvery tradable—but only if you follow strict money management rules and don’t go \ncrazy with easy margins. Professionals put on small initial positions and pyramid \nthem if a trade moves in their favor. They keep adding new contracts while moving \nstops beyond breakeven.\nWhen you become interested in futures, it’s a good idea to make your first steps in \nthose markets where you know something about the fundamentals. If you are a cattle \nrancher, a house builder, or a loan officer, then cattle, lumber, or interest rate futures \nwould be logical starting points. If you have no particular interests, make your first \nsteps in relatively inexpensive markets. In the United States, corn, sugar, and, in a \nslow year, copper can be good markets for beginners. They are liquid, volatile, and \nnot too expensive.\nWe’ll return to the futures markets in Part 9, “Risk Management.” There you’ll \nfind which contracts you may or may not trade, depending on their price and volatil-\nity as well as your account size.\nFutures traders with small accounts sometimes trade mini-contracts.

The exceptions are stock index \nfutures, where mini contracts have higher volumes than regular ones.\n■\n■47. Forex\nThe currency market is the largest asset class in the world by trading volume, with a \nturnover of over $4 trillion per day. Currencies trade around the clock—from 20:15 \nGMT on Sunday to 22 GMT on Friday, stopping only on weekends. While some cur-\nrency trades serve the hedging needs of importers and exporters, most transactions \nare speculative.\nThe United States is the only country in the world where most people don’t think \nmuch about currencies. The moment an American sets foot abroad, he realizes that \neveryone, from executives to taxi drivers, watches the exchange rates. When people \noutside the United States get their hands on a bit of trading capital, often their first \nidea is to trade forex.\nThe forex market has no central location. Institutions deal in the interbank mar-\nket, trading with each other using online platforms, such as Bloomberg or Reuters. \nUnless you can trade $10 million of spot forex at a pop, you’ll be trading retail, going \nthrough a broker.\nMost beginners open accounts at forex shops where they immediately run into a \nfatal flaw—your broker is your enemy. When you trade stocks, futures, or options, \nyour broker is your agent: he executes your trades for a fee, and that’s the end of it. \nNot so in most forex (as well as CFD) houses, where your broker is likely to take \nthe opposite side of every trade. You and the forex house are now against each other: \nif you lose, your broker will profit, and if you win, he’ll lose. Since the house holds \nmost of the cards, it has many ways to achieve the desired result.\nMost forex houses “bucket” customer orders—accept them without executing \nany trades. They charge spreads, commissions, interest, etc. for non-existent trades. \nI received the clearest explanation of their game from a chatty head dealer at a major \nEuropean forex house (which is now expanding worldwide, with branches in the \nUnited States—I see their billboards in New York).\nThat forex house accepts any trade in any currency pair, whether long or short, \nbut always shifts the bid-ask spread to put itself at an advantage from the get-go. \nThose so-called “trades” never go anywhere—they’re only kept as electronic entries \nin the firm’s books. The forex house charges interest if its customers take their phan-\ntom “positions” overnight, even though there is never any position, since the house \nsimply holds the opposite side of each trade. The only time the firm goes to the le-\ngitimate market is when multiple client orders cluster on the same side of the same \ncurrency pair in excess of a million dollars—that’s when the house hedges its own \nexposure in the real market.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

FOREX\t\n195\nWhen you trade stocks, options, or futures, your broker buys or sells on your \nbehalf, earning a commission for this service, and doesn’t care whether you win or \nlose. This is great, because he has no incentive to push you into losing. On the other \nhand, a forex house that buckets your orders wants you to lose, so that it can win. In \naddition to shifting bid-ask spreads and charging interest on non-existent positions, \nit may even charge a daily “resettlement fee”—the full bid-ask spread for every day \nyou hold a trade.\nForex shops help ensure their clients’ demise by offering homicidal leverage. I’ve \nseen them offer leverage of 100:1 and even 400:1. A newcomer who scrapes to-\ngether a $1,000 stake can suddenly control a position worth a hundred thousand dol-\nlars. This means that the slightest price wiggle against him is guaranteed to wipe out \nhis equity. That’s why those shops confidently keep clients’ money in-house, never \ntransmitting their trades to the real market—why share the loot with anyone else? \nThey are so certain of their clients’ demise that many compensate employees with \na percentage of the client deposits that they bring in—funds deposited with a forex \nhouse are as good as theirs.\n“The market has long been plagued by swindlers preying on the gullible,” accord-\ning to The New York Times. “The average individual foreign-exchange-trading victim \nloses about $15,000, according to CFTC records,” writes The  Wall Street Journal. Cur-\nrency trading “has become the fraud du jour,” according to Michael Dunn of the U.S. \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission.\nIn August 2008, the CFTC set up a special task force to deal with growing for-\neign exchange fraud. In January 2010, the CFTC identified a “number of improper \npractices” in the retail foreign exchange market, “among them solicitation fraud, a \nlack of transparency in the pricing and execution of transactions, unresponsiveness \nto customer complaints, and the targeting of unsophisticated, elderly, low net worth \nand other vulnerable individuals.” It proposed new rules limiting leverage to 10 to 1.\nFrauds may include churning customer accounts, selling useless software, im-\nproperly managing “managed accounts,” false advertising, and Ponzi schemes. All the \nwhile, promoters claim that trading foreign exchange is a road to profits.\nThe real forex market is a zero sum game, in which well-capitalized professional \ntraders, many of whom work for banks, devote full-time attention to trading. An \ninexperienced retail trader has a significant information disadvantage. The retail \ntrader always pays the bid-ask spread, which lowers his odds of winning. Retail \nforex traders are almost always undercapitalized and subject to the problem of \n“gambler’s ruin.” Even in a fair game between two players, the one with the lower \namount of capital has a higher probability of going bust in the long run.\nHaving observed forex shops for decades, I was amused to see what my best stu-\ndent did when he became interested in forex. This multimillionaire stock trader \ndecided to check out forex houses by opening large accounts and then waiting for \nthe night, when forex trading was at its thinnest. That’s when he placed his orders, \nalways of a very unusual and atypical size, and watched the tape. There were only two \nhouses that showed his orders on tape—the rest, apparently, got bucketed.\n",

He will \nsoon find out that the market offers a painfully expensive form of entertainment. \nEarly in my career, I heard from a professional trader that “successful trading should \nbe a little bit boring.” He spent long hours each day doing homework, sifting through \nmarket data, calculating risks, and maintaining records. Those time-consuming tasks \nweren’t exciting—but his success was built on such grunt work. Beginners and gam-\nblers get a full load of entertainment, but pay for it with losses.\nAnother emotional mistake is counting money in open trades. Newbies dream \nabout what they can buy with open profits or freeze from the shock of compar-\ning open losses to their paychecks. Thinking about money interferes with decision \nmaking. Professionals focus on managing trades; they count money only after those \ntrades are closed.\nA trader who counts profits in an open trade is like a lawyer who, in the middle \nof a trial, starts dreaming of what he’ll buy with his fee. That trial is still going on, \nhis opponents are building a case against his client, and counting money will not help \nhim win—quite the contrary, it’ll distract him and cause him to lose. An amateur \nwho becomes upset counting losses in an open trade is like a surgeon who throws a \ntray of instruments after the patient on the table starts bleeding—his frustration will \nnot improve the outcome of the case.\nProfessional traders don’t count money in open trades. They do it at the end of an \naccounting period, such as a month.\nIf you were to ask me about an open trade, I could answer that it’s a bit ahead, a lot \nahead, or a bit behind (a lot behind is unlikely because of my stops). If you were to \npress me for a number, I might tell you how many ticks I’m ahead or behind, but I’ll \nnever translate those ticks into dollars. It took me years to train myself to break the \ndestructive habit of counting money in open trades. I can count ticks, but my mind \nstops before converting them into dollars. It’s like being on a diet—there is plenty \nof food around, but you don’t touch it.\nFocus on managing your trade, and the money will follow almost as an afterthought.\nAnother key point: a professional doesn’t get worked up about his wins or losses \nin a single trade. There is a great deal of randomness in the markets. We can do \neverything right—and still end up with a losing trade, just like a surgeon can do \neverything right and still lose a patient. That’s why a trader should care only about \nhaving a method with a positive expectation and work on being profitable at the end \nof his accounting period.\nThe goal of a successful professional in any field is to reach his personal best—to \nbecome the best doctor, the best lawyer, or the best trader. Handle each trade like \na surgical procedure—seriously, soberly, without sloppiness or shortcuts. Concen-\ntrate on trading right.

When he gets a margin call, he scrambles to send more money to the \nbroker, as if the initial loss hadn’t been bad enough. Why should a losing trade turn \nin his favor? There’s no logical reason, only wishful thinking.\nStubbornly holding a losing trade only deepens the wound. Losses have a way of \nsnowballing until what initially seemed like a bad loss starts looking like a bargain \nbecause the current drawdown is so much worse. Finally, a desperate loser bites the \nbullet and closes out a trade, taking a severe loss.\nRight after he exits, the market reverses and comes roaring back.\nThe trader is ready to smash his head against a wall—had he hung on, he would \nhave made money. Such reversals happen time and again because most losers re-\nspond to the same stimuli. People have similar emotions, regardless of their national-\nity or education. A frightened trader with sweaty palms and a pounding heart feels \nand acts the same way, whether he grew up in New York or Hong Kong and whether \nhe had 2 or 20 years of schooling.\nThe intellectual demands of trading are modest, but its emotional demands are im-\nmense. Many years ago, a highly educated but very emotional trader showed me how \nto trade divergences near channel walls. I fine-tuned his method, added risk manage-\nment rules, and continue to make money with it to this day. The man who taught \nme had busted out because of his lack of discipline and ended up going door to door, \nselling aluminum siding. Emotional trading and impulsivity are not good for success.\nRoy Shapiro, a New York psychologist from whose article the title of this sub-\nchapter is borrowed, writes: “With great hope, in the private place where we make \nour trading decisions, our current idea is made ready.... one difficulty in selling is \nthe attachment experienced toward the position. After all, once something is ours, \nwe naturally tend to become attached to it.... This attachment to the things we buy \nhas been called the “endowment effect” by psychologists and economists and we all \nrecognize it in our financial transactions as well as in our inability to part with that \nold sports jacket hanging in the closet. The speculator is the parent of the idea.... \nthe position takes on meaning as a personal extension of self, almost as one’s child \nmight.... Another reason that Johnny does not sell, even when the position may be \nlosing ground, is because he wants to dream.... For many, at the moment of pur-\nchase, critical judgment weakens and hope ascends to govern the decision process.”\nDreaming in the markets is a luxury we can’t afford.\nDr. Shapiro describes a test that shows how people conduct business involving \na chance. First, a group of people are given a choice: a 75 percent chance to win \n$1000 with a 25 percent chance of getting nothing—or a sure $700. Four out of \nfive subjects take the second choice, even after it is explained to them that the first \nchoice leads to a $750 gain over time. The majority makes the emotional decision \nand settles for a smaller gain.\nAnother test is given: People have to choose between a sure loss of $700 or a 75 \npercent chance of losing $1000 and a 25 percent chance of losing nothing. Three out \nof four take the second choice, condemning themselves to lose $50 more than they \nhave to. In trying to avoid risk, they maximize losses!\n",

It is human \nnature to take profits quickly and losses slowly. The irrational behavior increases \nwhen people feel under pressure. According to Dr. Shapiro, at the racetrack, “bets \non long shots increase in the last two races of the day.”\nProf. Daniel Kahneman writes in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow: “The sure loss is \nvery aversive, and this drives you to take the risk … Considerable loss aversion exists \neven when the amount at risk is minuscule relative to your wealth … losses loom \nlarger than corresponding gains.” He adds: “Animals, including people, fight harder \nto prevent losses than to achieve gains” and spells it out: “People who face very bad \noptions take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse \nin exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often \nturns manageable failures into disasters.”  Why do we act this way? Prof. Kahneman \nexplains: “Except for the very poor, for whom income coincides with survival, the \nmain motivators of money-seeking are not necessarily economic. Money is a proxy \nfor points on a scale of self-regard and achievement.”  These rewards and punish-\nments, promises and threats, are all in our heads.\nEmotional trading destroys losers. A review of trading records usually shows that \nthe worst damage was done by a few large losses or a long string of losses, while \ntrying to trade one’s way out of a hole. The discipline of good money management \nwould have kept us out of that hole in the first place.\nProbability and Innumeracy\nInnumeracy—the inability to count or understand the basic notions of probability—\nis a fatal weakness for traders. The counting skills aren’t hard, can be picked up from \nmany basic books, and then sharpened with some practice.\nThe lively book Innumeracy by John Allen Paulos is an excellent primer on the con-\ncepts of probability. Paulos describes being told by a seemingly intelligent person at a \ncocktail party: “If the chance of rain is 50 percent on Saturday and 50 percent on Sun-\nday, then it is 100 percent certain it will be a rainy weekend.” Someone who under-\nstands so little about probability is sure to lose money trading. You owe it to yourself \nto develop a grasp of the basic mathematical and logical concepts involved in trading.\nThere are very few ironclad certainties in market analysis, which is largely based \non probabilities. “If the signals A and B are present, then the outcome C will occur” \nis not the kind of logic that holds up in the markets.\nRalph Vince begins his important book Portfolio Management Formulas with this de-\nlightful paragraph: “Toss a coin in the air. For an instant you experience one of the \nmost fascinating paradoxes of nature—the random process. While the coin is in \nthe air there is no way to tell for certain whether it will land heads or tails. Yet over \nmany tosses, the outcome can be reasonably predicted.”\nMathematical expectation is an important concept for traders. Each trade has \neither a positive expectation, also called the player’s edge, or a negative expectation, \nalso called the house advantage, depending on who has better odds in a game. If you \nand I flip a coin, neither of us has an edge—each has a 50 percent chance of winning. If \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

This “house advantage” will create a negative \nmathematical expectation. No system for money management can beat a negative \nexpectation over a period of time.\nA Positive Expectation\nA skilled card-counter has an edge against a casino, unless they detect him and throw \nhim out. Casinos love drunken gamblers but hate card counters. An edge lets you \nwin more often than lose over a period of time. Without an edge, you might as well \ngive money to charity. In trading, the edge comes from systems that deliver greater \nprofits than losses, after slippage and commissions, over a period of time. Acting on \nhunches leads to losses.\nThe best trading systems are simple and robust. They have very few elements. The \nmore complex the systems, the higher the risk that some of its components will break.\nTraders love to optimize systems, making them fit past data. The trouble is, your \nbroker won’t let you trade in the past. Markets change, and indicator parameters that \nwould have nailed the trends last month are unlikely to nail them a month from now. \nInstead of optimizing your system, try to de-optimize it. A robust system holds up \nwell to market changes and beats a heavily optimized system in real trading.\nFinally, once you develop a good system, stop messing with it. If you like to tinker, \ndesign another system. As Robert Prechter put it: “Most traders take a good system \nand destroy it by trying to make it into a perfect system.”\nOnce you have a trading system that works, it’s time to set the rules for money \nmanagement. You can win only if you have a positive mathematical expectation from \na sensible trading system. Money management will help you exploit a good system, \nbut cannot rescue a bad one.\nBusinessman’s Risk or Loss\nWe analyze markets in order to identify trends. Be careful not to become over-\nconfident when anticipating future prices. The future is fundamentally unknowable. \nWhen we buy, expecting a rally, it is entirely possible that an unforeseen event may \nflip the market and send it down. Your actions in response to surprises will define \nyou as a trader.\nA pro manages his trades, accepting what’s called a “businessman’s risk.” This \nmeans that the amount he risks exposes him to only a minor equity drop. A loss, on \nthe other hand, may threaten an account’s health and even survival. We must draw a \nclear line between a businessman’s risk and a loss. That border is defined by the frac-\ntion of the account a trader puts at risk in a trade.\nIf you follow the risk management rules described below, you’ll accept only a \nnormal businessman’s risk. Violating a well-defined red line will expose you to dan-\ngerous losses.\n“This time is different,” says an undisciplined trader. “I’ll give this trade a little extra \nroom.”  The market seduces traders into breaking their rules.

A middle-aged man, he got into this \nbusiness in his 20s, while working for a naval consulting firm after graduate school. \nBored with his day job, he designed a trading system but couldn’t trade it because it \nrequired a minimum of $200,000, which he didn’t have in those days. “I had to go \nto other people,” he said, “and ask them for money. Once I explained to them what \nI was going to do and they gave me money, I had to stick to my system. It would \nhave been unconscionable to deviate from the system I told them I would follow. My \npoverty worked for me.” Poverty and integrity.\n■\n■49. The Two Main Rules of Risk Control\nIf trading is a high-wire act, then safety demands stringing a net underneath that wire. If \nwe slip, the net will save us from getting smashed against the floor. The only thing bet-\nter than a safety net is two safety nets: if one doesn’t catch us as we fall, the other will.\nEven the best planned trades can go awry because of randomness in the markets. \nEven the best analyses and the clearest trade setups can’t prevent accidents. What \nyou can control is risk. You do it by managing the size of your trades and the place-\nment of stops. This is how you keep the inevitable losses small, not allowing them to \ncripple your account, so that you can win in the long run.\nUgly losses stick out like sore thumbs from most account records. Every per-\nformance review shows that a single terrible loss or a short string of bad losses did \nmost of the damage to an account. Had a trader cut his losses sooner, his bottom \nline would have been much higher. Traders dream of profits but freeze when a los-\ning trade hits them. If you follow risk management rules, you’ll quickly get out of \nharm’s way instead of waiting and praying for the market to turn.\nMarkets can snuff out an account with a single horrible loss that effectively takes a \nperson out of the game, like a shark bite. Markets can also kill with a series of bites, \nnone of them lethal but combined they strip an account to the bone, like a pack of \npiranhas. The two pillars of money management are the 2% and 6% Rules. The 2% \nRule will save your account from shark bites and the 6% Rule from piranhas.\nThe Two Worst Mistakes\nThere are two quick ways to ruin an account: not use stops and put on trades that are \ntoo large for that account’s size.\nTrading without stops exposes you to unlimited losses. In the following chapters, \nwe’ll discuss the principles and rules of risk control, but they will work only if you \nuse stops.\nThere are several methods for setting stops, and we’ll discuss them in Chapter \n54. We want to place our stops neither too far nor too close. At this point, just \nkeep in mind that you must use stops. You have to know your maximum level of \nrisk—it’s as simple as that. If you don’t know your maximum level of risk, you’re \nflying blind.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

      "text": " 50. THE TWO PERCENT RULE\t\n203\nThe other fatal error is overtrading—putting on trades whose size is too large for \nyour account. This is like putting a huge sail on a small boat—a strong gust of wind \nwill flip the boat over instead of making it go faster.\nPeople put on trades that are too large for their accounts out of ignorance, greed, \nor a combination of both. There is a simple mathematical rule that gives you the \nmaximum size for every trade, as you are about to see.\n■\n■50. The Two Percent Rule\nOne disastrous loss can do to an account what a shark does to a hapless swimmer. A \npoor beginner who loses a quarter of his equity in a single trade is like a swimmer \nwho just lost an arm or a leg to a shark and is bleeding into the water. He’d have to \ngenerate a 33% return on the remaining capital simply to come back to even. The \nchances of him being able to do that are slim to none.\nThe typical victim of a “shark bite” loses more money. He loses confidence and \nbecomes fearful of pulling the trigger. The way to avoid “shark bite” losses is by fol-\nlowing the 2% Rule. It will limit your losses to a manageable size—to a normal \nbusinessman’s risk.\nThe 2% Rule prohibits you from risking more than 2% of your account \nequity on any single trade.\nFor example, if you have $50,000 in your account, the 2% Rule limits your maxi-\nmum risk on any trade to $1,000. This is not the size of your trade—it’s the amount \nyou put at risk, based on the distance from your entry to your stop.\nLet’s say you decide to buy a stock for $40 and put a stop at $38, just below \nsupport. This means you’ll be risking $2 per share. Dividing your total permitted \nrisk of $1,000 by your $2 risk per share tells you that you may trade no more than \n500 shares. You are perfectly welcome to trade fewer shares—you don’t have to \ngo the max every time. If you feel very bullish about that stock and want to trade \nthe maximum permitted size, that number of shares will be limited to 500.\nGood market analysis alone will not make you a winner. The ability to find good \ntrades will not guarantee success. Markets are full of good analysts who destroy their \naccounts. You can profit from your research only if you protect yourself from sharks.\nI’ve seen traders make 20, 30, and once even 50 profitable trades in a row, and \nstill end up losing money. When you’re on a winning streak, it’s easy to feel you’ve \nfigured out the game. Then a disastrous loss wipes out all profits and tears into your \nequity. You need the shark repellent of good money management.\nA good trading system will give you an edge in the long run, but in the short run \nthere is a great deal of randomness in the markets. The outcome of any single trade \nis close to a toss-up. A professional trader expects to be profitable by the end of the \nmonth or the quarter, but ask him whether he’ll make money on his next trade and \nhe’ll honestly say he doesn’t know. That’s why he uses stops: to prevent negative \ntrades from damaging his account.\n",

Money management rules will help you protect your account as \na whole. The single most important rule is to limit your exposure on any trade to no \nmore than 2% of your account.\nThis rule applies only to money in your trading account. It doesn’t include your \nsavings, equity in your house, retirement account, or Christmas club. Your trading \ncapital is the money you’ve dedicated to trading. This is your true risk capital—the \nequity in your trading enterprise. If you have separate trading accounts for stocks, \nfutures, and options, apply the 2% Rule to each account separately.\nI’ve noticed a curious difference in how people react when they first hear about \nthe 2% Rule. Newbies with small accounts often object that this number is too low. \nSomeone asked me whether the 2% Rule could be increased when he was feeling \nespecially confident about a trade, and I answered that it would be like adding extra \nlength to the cord for bungee jumping because you like the view from the bridge.\nProfessionals, on the other hand, often say that 2% is too high and they try to risk \nless. You wouldn’t want to lose 2% of a million dollars on a single trade in one day. \nA hedge fund manager who consulted with me said that his project for the next six \nmonths was to increase his trading size. He never risked more than 0.5% of equity \non a trade—and was going to teach himself to risk 1%. Good traders tend to stay \nwell below the 2% limit. Whenever amateurs and professionals are on the opposite \nsides of an argument, you know which side to choose. Try to risk less than 2%—it is \nsimply the maximum level.\nMeasure your account equity on the first day of each month. If you start the \nmonth with $100,000 in your account, the 2% Rule allows you to risk a maximum \nof $2,000 per trade. If you have a good month and your equity rises to $105,000, \nthen your 2% limit for the next month will be—what? Quick! Remember, good \ntraders can count! If you have $105,000 in your account, the 2% Rule allows you \nto risk $2,100 and trade a slightly bigger size. If, on the other hand, you had a bad \nmonth and your equity fell to $95,000, the 2% Rule will set your maximum permit-\nted risk at $1,900 per trade for the following month. The 2% Rule links the size of \nyour trades to your performance as well as account size.\nThe Iron Triangle of Risk Control\nHow many shares will you buy or sell short in your next trade? Beginners often \nchoose an arbitrary number, such as a thousand or 200 shares. They may buy more if \nthey’ve made money in their latest trade or less if they’ve lost money.\nIn fact, trade size should be based on a formula instead of vague gut feel. Use the \n2% Rule to make rational decisions on the maximum number of shares you may buy \nor sell short in any trade. I named this process “The Iron Triangle of risk control” \n(Figure 50.1).\nFor example, when I volunteered to teach a yearlong course “Money and Trading” \nin a local high school and wanted to make the experience real for the kids, I opened \na $40,000 account. I told my students that if, at the end of the school year, we made \nmoney, I’d give half the profit to their school and distribute the rest among class \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

The agile Mr. Hare sees that the average daily range in gold is about \n$30, worth $3,000 per day for a single contract. The daily range in corn is about 10 \ncents, worth $500 per day for a single contract. He thinks that if he can catch just \nhalf of a day’s range, he’ll make $1,500 per contract in gold, while the same level of \nskill will bring him only $250 in corn. Mr. Hare logs into his brokerage account and \nbuys two contracts of gold.\nThe cautious Mr. Turtle has a different arithmetic. He begins by using the 2% \nRule to cap his maximum risk per trade at $1,000. He sees that it would be impos-\nsible to place a meaningful stop while trading gold which can move $3,000 a day. \nTo buy gold in his account would be like grabbing a very large tiger by a very short \ntail. If, on the other hand, he trades corn, he’ll have good staying power. That tiger \nis smaller and has a longer tail, which he can wrap around his wrist. Mr. Turtle buys \na contract of corn. Who do you think is more likely to win in the long run, Mr. Hare \nor Mr. Turtle?\nFutures markets are more deadly than stocks not because of any special com-\nplexity. Sure, they have some specific angles, but those aren’t too hard to learn. \nFutures kill traders by seducing them with paper-thin margins. They offer enor-\nmous leverage –ability to trade large positions on a 5% margin. This works wonders \nwhen the market moves in your favor, but it slices your wallet when the market \nturns against you.\nYou can succeed in futures only with sensible risk control, using the 2% Rule.\nA.\tCalculate 2% of your account value—this will be the maximum acceptable risk \nlevel for any trade. If you have $50,000 in your futures account, the most you \ncan risk is $1,000.\nB.\tExamine the charts of the market that interests you and write down your planned \nentry, target, and stop. Remember: a trade without these three numbers is not a \ntrade but a gamble. Express the value of the move from your entry to your stop \nin dollars.\nC.\tDivide A by B, and if the result turns out to be less than one, no trade is permit-\nted—it means you cannot afford to trade even one contract.\nLet’s review two market examples, featuring similar chart patterns (Figure 50.2). \nLet’s assume you have a $50,000 account, which permits you to risk the maximum \nof $1,000 per trade.\nYou can trade futures reasonably safely only with strict money management. The \nleverage of futures can work for you—as long as you stay away from those contracts \nthat can kill your account.\nA professional futures trader surprised me early in my career when he told me \nhe spent a third of his time on risk management. Beginners jump into trades with-\nout giving them much thought. Intermediate-level traders focus on market analysis. \nProfessionals dedicate a massive proportion of their time to risk control—and take \nmoney away from beginners and amateurs.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

THE TWO PERCENT RULE\t\n207\nIf you cannot afford to trade a certain market, you can still download its data, do \nyour homework, and paper trade it as if you were doing it with real money. This will \nprepare you for the day when your account grows big enough or the market grows \nquiet enough for you to put on a trade.\nSilver\nWheat\nA\nB\nC\nB\nC\nA\nFIGURE 50.2  Daily charts with 13- and 26-day EMAs and Autoenvelopes.

Prices have traced a double \nbottom with a false downside breakout. MACD-Histogram has traced a bullish divergence. \nThe Impulse system has turned blue, permitting buying. The nearby futures contract trades \nat $21.415 a few minutes before the close.\nYou decide that if you buy, your profit target will be near $23, halfway from the EMA to the \nupper channel line. Your stop will be at $20.60, the level of the latest low. You’ll be risking \n$0.815/oz trying to make about $1.585/oz—a 2:1 reward/risk ratio, an acceptable number.\nAre you allowed to take this trade? Absolutely not! That $0.815/oz risk per contract \ntranslates into $4,075 total risk, since one contract covers of 5,000 ounces of silver. Re-\nmember, your maximum permitted risk is $1,000. If you’re eager to take this trade, you may \nbuy a single mini-contract. It covers only 1,000 ounces of silver, meaning you’ll risk $815. \nBest wishes for that sensible trade.\nNow, suppose you’re interested in buying wheat at the right edge of this chart. Its tech-\nnical picture looks similar: a double bottom with a bullish divergence of MACD-Lines and \nMACD-Histogram. The Impulse system has turned blue, permitting buying. Shortly before \nthe close, prices are near 658 cents.\nYou decide that if you enter there, your target will be near 680 cents, near the upper chan-\nnel line. Your stop will go to 652 cents, the level of a recent low. You’ll be risking 10 cents/bu, \ntrying to make about 22 cents/bu—a reward/risk ratio of 2:1, similar to that of silver.\nAre you allowed to take this trade? Yes! That 10 cent risk per contract translates into \n$500 total risk, since the contract covers 5,000 bushels of wheat. Remember, your maxi-\nmum permitted risk is $1,000. If you’re very bullish, you may even buy two contracts.\nYou must keep in mind that when trading futures the technical pictures of different mar-\nkets may look similar, but you must base your decisions to trade or not to trade on money \nmanagement rules.\n",

What makes it so dangerous is that it attacks in packs. If a dog, a donkey, \nor a person stumbles into a tropical stream, a pack of piranhas can attack with such \na mass of bites that the victim collapses. A bull can walk into a river, be attacked by a \npack of piranhas, and a few minutes later only its bones will be left in the water. \nA trader, who keeps sharks at bay with the 2% Rule, still needs protection from pi-\nranhas. The 6% Rule will save you from being nibbled to death.\nMost of us, when we find ourselves in trouble, start pushing harder. Losing trad-\ners often take on bigger positions, trying to trade their way out of a hole. A better \nresponse to a losing streak is to step aside and take time off to think. The 6% Rule \nsets a limit on the maximum monthly drawdown in any account. If you reach it, you \nstop trading for the rest of the month. The 6% Rule forces you to get out of the wa-\nter before piranhas get you.\nThe 6% Rule prohibits you from opening any new trades for the rest of \nthe month when the sum of your losses for the current month and the \nrisks in open trades reach 6% of your account equity.\nWe all go through periods when we are in tune with the markets, taking one profit \nafter another. When everything we touch turns to gold, that’s the time to trade actively.\nThere are other times when everything we touch turns into a completely different \nsubstance. We go through periods when our systems go out of sync with the market, \ndelivering one loss after another. It’s important to recognize such dark periods and \nnot push yourself but rather step back. A professional on a losing streak is likely to \ntake a break, continue to monitor the market, and wait to get in gear with it again. \nAmateurs are more likely to keep pushing until their accounts become crippled. The \n6% Rule will make you pause while your account is still largely intact.\nThe Concept of Available Risk\nBefore you put on a trade, ask yourself: what would happen if all your trades sud-\ndenly turned against you? If you used the 2% Rule to set stops and trade sizes, the \n6% Rule will limit the maximum total loss that your account may suffer.\n1.\tAdd up all your losses taken this month.\n2.\t Add up your risks on all currently open trades. The dollar risk of any open posi-\ntion is the distance from your entry to the current stop, multiplied by the trade \nsize. Suppose you’ve bought 200 shares for $50, with a stop at $48.50, risking \n$1.50 per share. In that case, your open risk is $300. If that trade starts going \nyour way and you move your stop to breakeven, your open risk will become zero.\n3.\tAdd the two lines above (losses for the month plus risks on open trades). If \ntheir sum comes to 6% of what your account equity was at the beginning of the \nmonth, you may not put on another trade until the end of the month or until the \nopen trades move in your favor, allowing you to raise your stops.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Not according to the 6% Rule because his account is already exposed to a \ncombined risk of 6% in stocks B, C, and D (there is no longer a risk in stock A). \nHe may not buy stock E.\n8.\tA few days later, stock B hits its stop. Stock E still looks attractive. May he buy it? \nNo, since he already lost 2% on stock B and has a 4% exposure to risk in stocks \nC and D. Adding another position at this time would expose him to more than \n6% risk per month.\nThree open trades isn’t a lot of diversification. If you wish to make more trades, \nset your risk per trade at less than 2%. For example, if you risk only 1% of your \naccount equity on any trade, you may open up to six positions before maxing out at \nthe 6% limit. In trading a large account, I use the 6% Rule but tighten the 2% Rule \nto well under 1%.\nThe 6% Rule allows you to increase your trading size when you’re on a winning \nstreak but makes you stop trading early in a losing streak. When markets move in \nyour favor, you can move your stops to breakeven and have more available risk for \nnew trades. On the other hand, if your positions start going against you and hitting \nstops, you’ll quickly stop trading and save the bulk of your account for a fresh start \nnext month.\nThe 2% Rule and the 6% Rule provide guidelines for pyramiding—adding to \nwinning positions. If you buy a stock and it climbs high enough to raise your stop \nabove breakeven, then you may buy more of the same stock, as long as the risk on \nthe new position is no more than 2% of your account equity and your total account \nrisk is less than 6%. Handle each addition as a separate trade.\nMany traders go through emotional swings, feeling elated at the highs and gloomy \nat the lows. Those mood swings will not help you trade, just the opposite. It is better \nto invest your energy in risk control. The 2% and the 6% Rules will convert your \ngood intentions into the reality of safer trading.\n■\n■52. A Comeback from a Drawdown\nWhen the level of risk goes up, our ability to perform goes down. Beginners make \nmoney on small trades, start feeling confident, and jack up trade size. That’s when \nthey start losing. The increased level of risk on bigger positions makes them stiffer \nand less nimble, and that’s all it takes to fall behind.\nI saw a great example of that while running a psychological training group for a \nday-trading firm in New York. That firm taught its traders a proprietary stock trad-\ning system and let them trade the firm’s capital on a profit-sharing basis. Their two \ntop traders were making up to a million dollars a month; others made much smaller \nprofits but quite a few lost money. The firm’s owner asked me to come and help los-\ning traders.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

A COMEBACK FROM A DRAWDOWN\t\n211\nThey were shocked to hear that a psychiatrist was coming and loudly protested \nthey “weren’t crazy.” The owner provided the motivation by telling his worst per-\nformers they had to participate—or else leave the firm. After six weeks, the results \nwere such that we had a waiting list for the second group.\nSince the company taught traders its own system, we focused on psychology and \nrisk control. In one of our first meetings, a trader complained that he had lost money \neach day for the past 13 days. His manager, who sat in on our meetings, confirmed \nthat the fellow was using the firm’s system but couldn’t make any money. I began by \nsaying that I’d take off my hat for anyone who lost 13 days in a row and had the emo-\ntional strength to come in and trade the next morning. I asked the man how many \nshares he traded, since the firm set a maximum for each trader. He was permitted to \nbuy or sell up to 700 shares at a clip, but voluntarily reduced it to 500.\nI told him to drop his size down to 100 shares until he had a week with more win-\nning days than losing and was profitable overall. Once he cleared that hurdle for two \nweeks in a row, he could go up to trading 200 shares at a clip. Then, after another \n2-week profitable period, he could go up to 300 shares, and so on. He was allowed \na 100 share increment after two weeks of profitable trading, but if he had a single \nlosing week, he’d have to drop back to the previous level. In other words, he had to \nstart small, increase the size slowly, but drop it fast in case of trouble.\nThe trader loudly objected that 100 shares weren’t enough to make money. I told \nhim to stop kidding himself, since by trading 500 shares he wasn’t making any money \neither, and he reluctantly agreed. When we met a week later he reported that he had \nfour profitable days and was profitable overall. He made very little money because \nof the 100 share size, but he was ahead of the game. He continued to make money \nduring the next week and then stepped up to 200 shares. After another profitable \nweek he asked, “Doc, do you think this could be psychological?”  The group roared.\nWhy would a man lose while trading 500 shares, but make money trading 100 \nor 200?\nI took a $10 bill out of my pocket and asked whether anyone in our group would \nlike to earn it by climbing on top of our long and narrow conference table and \nwalking from one end to the other. Several hands went up. Wait, I said, I have a bet-\nter offer. I’ll give $1,000 cash to anyone who comes with me up to the roof of our \n10-story office building and uses a board as wide as this table to walk to the roof of \nanother 10-story building across the boulevard. No volunteers.\nI started egging on the group—the board will be sturdy, we’ll do it on a wind-\nless day, I’ll pay $1,000 cash on the spot. The physical challenge would be the same \nas walking on the conference table, but the reward so much greater. Still no takers. \nWhy? Because if you lose your balance on the table, you’ll jump down a couple of \nfeet and land on the carpet. If you lose your balance between two rooftops, you’d be \nsplattered on the asphalt.\nThe higher levels of risk impair our ability to perform. You need to train yourself \nto accept risks slowly and in well-defined steps. Depending on how actively you \ntrade, those steps can be measured in weeks or months, but the principle remains \nthe same—you need to be profitable during two units of time to go up a step in \n",

This is especially useful for people who want to return to trading after a \nbad drawdown. You need to gradually work your way back into trading, without an \nupsurge of fear.\nMost beginners are in a hurry to make a killing, but guess who gets killed. Un-\nscrupulous brokers promote overtrading (putting on trades that are too big for your \naccount) to generate commissions. Some stockbrokers outside the United States \noffer a “shoulder” of 10:1, allowing you to buy $10,000 worth of stock for every \n$1,000 you deposit with the firm. Some forex houses offer a deadly “shoulder” of \n100:1 and even 400:1.\nPutting on a trade is like diving for treasure. There is gold on the ocean floor, but \nas you scoop it up, remember to glance at your air gauge. The ocean floor is littered \nwith the remains of divers who saw great opportunities but ran out of air. A profes-\nsional diver always thinks about his air supply. If he doesn’t get any gold today, he’ll \ngo for it tomorrow. He needs to survive and dive again. Beginners kill themselves by \nrunning out of air. The lure of free gold is too strong. Free gold!

The 2% Rule will \nkeep you safe from the sharks, while the 6% Rule will save you from the piranhas. \nIf you follow these rules and have a reasonable trading system, you’ll be miles ahead \nof your competitors.\nA Trading Manager\nIt used to puzzle me why institutional traders as a group performed so much better \nthan private traders. An average private trader in the United States is a 50-year-old \nmarried, college-educated man, often a business owner or a professional. You would \nthink this thoughtful, computer-literate, book-reading individual would run circles \naround some loud 23-year-old who used to play ball in college and hasn’t read a book \nsince his junior year. In reality, institutional traders as a group outperform private \ntraders year after year. Is it because of their fast reflexes? Not really, because young \nprivate traders perform no better than older ones. Nor do institutional traders win \nbecause of training, which is skimpy in most firms.\nA curious fact: when successful institutional traders go out on their own, most of \nthem lose money. They may lease the same gear, trade the same system, and stay in \ntouch with their contacts, but still fail. After a few months, most cowboys are back \nin head-hunters’ offices, looking for a trading job. How come they could make \nmoney for the firms but not for themselves?\nWhen an institutional trader quits his firm, he leaves behind his manager, the \nperson in charge of discipline and risk control. That manager sets the maximum \nrisk per trade. It is similar to what a private trader can do with the 2% Rule. Firms \noperate from huge capital bases and their risk limits are much higher in dollar terms \nbut tiny in percentage terms. A trader who violates his risk limit is fired.

He enforces \ndiscipline that saves institutional traders from disastrous losses, which destroy many \nprivate accounts.\nIn addition to setting a risk limit per trade, a manager sets the maximum allowed \nmonthly drawdown for each trader. When an employee sinks to that level, his trad-\ning privileges are suspended for the rest of the month. A trading manager breaks his \ntraders’ losing streaks by forcing them to stop trading if they reach their monthly \nloss limit.

It illustrates \nusing Triple Screen for day-trading and profit-taking. The strategic decision to buy EGO \nwas taken on a 25-minute chart in area A, where the moving average turned up and the Im-\npulse system changed to green (notice that on the previous day there was a false downside \nbreakout—it indicated that this stock didn’t want to go down and may be setting up to rally).\nMy trading strategy here was “pullback to value,” which I executed on a 5-minute chart, \nas prices gapped up at the open but then pulled back into the value zone (area B). I went \nlong at $9.51; my initial target was $9.75, near the upper channel line on the 25-minute \nchart, with a stop at $9.37, for a nearly 2:1 reward/risk ratio. Since this was a day-trade, \nI had it on my screen all day long.\nAt first, with the uptrend being so strong, I considered taking it overnight, but then bear-\nish divergences began to develop in area C, and I placed an order to sell at $9.75. That \nturned out to be the high of the day, and my order wasn’t filled. As prices turned down from \ntheir bearish divergence on a 5-minute chart, I scrambled to lower my sell order to $9.70. \nIt was filled, and I was out with a profit before the close.

They don’t have you shooting for the moon, but \nare realistic. Keep in mind that “enough” is a power word—in life as well as trad-\ning. It puts you in control, and by getting “enough” in one trade after another, you’ll \nachieve excellent results over time.\nHow to define “enough”? I believe that moving averages and envelopes, along with \nrecent support and resistance levels can show us what would be “enough” for any \ngiven trade. Let me illustrate this with several examples: one a swing trade, another \na day-trade, and the third a long-term investment.\nVRSN was a fairly common example of a modest swing trade: entering near one \nof the channel lines and taking profits in the value zone between the two moving \naverages (Figure 53.1). This isn’t elephant hunting; this is rabbit hunting, a much \nmore reliable activity.\nThe EGO day-trade in Figure 53.2 illustrates buying a pullback into the value \nzone during an uptrend, with a profit target at the upper channel line. I used an oscil-\nlator to speed up my exit when the market wouldn’t let me exit at the initial target.\n“Fallen angels” is the name of a scan I use to look for possible investment candi-\ndates.

A stock that had lost 90% of its value has \nevery right to die, but if it chooses to live, it’s likely to rally.\nThe best time to look for “fallen angels” is when a bear market starts showing signs \nof bottoming. That’s when you find many candidates that survived bear attacks and \nare starting to get up from the floor. This example shows an old bull market darling \nIGOI that got badly mauled but stopped declining and began to rise. The weekly \nchart in Figure 53.3 shows two prior attempts to return to the multiyear peak area. \nEach of those rallies retraced just about half of the previous bear market.\nIs this going to be an easy trade? Far from it. First of all, the latest bottom was \nnear $2, and if you place your stop there, your risk per share will be quite high, and \nyou’ll have to reduce trade size. Also, the expected rally may take anywhere from a \nfew months to several years to get going. Are you prepared to wait that long, with \nyour capital tied up? Last but not least, the volume of this stock is low. It will rise if \nprices rally, but if the rally fizzles out, selling will not be easy. Taking all these factors \ninto account, you can see how hard it is to buy for the long haul.\n■\n■54. How to Set Stops:  \nSay No to Wishful Thinking\nA trade without a stop is a gamble. If you’re after thrills, better go to a real casino. \nTake a trip to Macao, Las Vegas, or Atlantic City, where a gambling house will serve \nyou free drinks and may even comp you a room while you’re having fun. Gamblers \nwho lose money on Wall Street receive no freebies.\nStops are a must for long-term survival and success, but most of us feel a great \nemotional reluctance to use them. The market reinforces our bad habits by training \nus not to use stops. We all have been through this unpleasant experience: you buy \na stock and set a stop that gets hit and you exit with a loss—only to see your stock \nreverse and rally just as you originally expected. Had you held that stock without a \nstop, you would’ve profited instead of losing. Getting repeatedly whipsawed like that \nmakes you feel disgusted with stops.\nAfter several such events, you start trading without stops, and it works beautifully \nfor a while. There are no more whipsaws. When a trade doesn’t work well, you get \nout of it without a stop—you have enough discipline. This happy ride ends after a \nlarge trade starts going bad. You keep waiting for it to rally a bit and give you a better \nexit, but it keeps sinking. As the days go by, it inflicts more and more damage on your \naccount—you’re being chewed up by a shark. Soon enough your survival is in dan-\nger, and your confidence is shattered.\nWhile you trade without stops, the sharks circling the perimeter of every account \ngrow bigger and meaner. If you trade without stops, a shark bite is only a question of \ntime. Yes, stops are a pain—but using them is a lesser evil than trading without them. \nThis reminds me of what Winston Churchill said about democracy: “It is the worst \nform of government except all the others that have been tried.”\nWhat should we do? I suggest accepting the irritation and the pain of stops but \nfocusing on making them more logical and less unpleasant.\n",

      "text": "220\t\nPRACTICAL DETAILS\nIn my previous book The New Sell and Sell Short, I dedicated a long chapter to the \nintricacies of placing various types of stops. Rather than repeat myself here, I’ll offer \nyou a quick summary.\nPlace Stops outside the Zone of “Market Noise”\nPut a stop too close and it’ll get whacked by some meaningless intraday swing. Put it \ntoo far, and you’ll have very skimpy protection.\nTo borrow an engineering concept, all market moves have two components: sig-\nnal and noise. The signal is the trend of your stock. When the trend is up, we can \ndefine noise as that part of each day’s range that protrudes below the previous day’s \nlow. When the trend is down, we can define noise as that part of each day’s range that \nprotrudes above the previous day’s high.\nSafeZone stops are described in detail in Come into My Trading Room. They mea-\nsure market noise and place stops at a multiple of noise level away from the market. \nIn brief, use the slope of a 22-day EMA to define the trend. If the trend is up, mark \nall downside penetrations of the EMA during the look-back period (10 to 20 days), \nadd their depths, and divide the sum by the number of penetrations. This gives you \nthe Average Downside Penetration for the selected look-back period. It reflects the \naverage level of noise in the current uptrend. You want to place your stops farther \naway from the market than the average level of noise. That’s why you need to multi-\nply an average downside penetration by a factor of two or greater. Placing your stop \nany closer would be self-defeating.\nWhen the trend, as defined by the EMA slope, is down, we calculate SafeZone \non the basis of upside penetrations of the previous bars’ highs. We count each upside \npenetrations during a selected time window and average that data to find the Average \nUpside Penetration. We multiply it by a coefficient, starting with 3, and add that to \nthe high of each bar. Shorting near the highs requires wider stops than buying near \nquiet, sold-out bottoms.\nLike all systems and indicators in this book, SafeZone is not a mechanical gadget to \nreplace independent thought. You have to establish the look-back period, the window \nof time during which SafeZone is calculated. You also need to fine-tune the coefficient \nby which you multiply the average penetration, so that your stop goes outside the \nnormal noise level.\nEven when not using SafeZone, you may wish to follow its principle of calculating \nan average penetration against the trend that you are aiming to trade—and putting \nyour stop well outside the zone of market noise.\nDon’t Place Your Stops at Obvious Levels\nA recent low that sticks out like a sore thumb from a tight weave of prices draws \ntraders to place stops slightly below that level. The trouble is most people place their \nstops there, creating a target-rich environment for the running of stops. The market \nhas an uncanny habit of quickly sinking back to those obvious lows and triggering \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Without trying to assign blame for \nraiding stops, let me suggest several solutions.\nIt pays to place your stops at non-obvious levels—either closer to the market or \ndeeper below an obvious low. A closer stop will cut your dollar risk but increase the \nrisk of a whipsaw. A deeper stop will help you sidestep some false breakouts, but if \nit gets hit you’ll lose more.\nTake your pick. For short-term swing trading, it generally pays to place your stops \ntighter, while for long-term position trades, you’d be better off with wider stops. \nRemember “the Iron Triangle of risk control”—a wider stop demands a smaller \ntrade size.\nOne method I like is Nic’s stop, named after my Australian friend Nic Grove. \nHe invented this method of placing a stop not near the lowest low, but at the second \nlowest (more shallow) low. The logic is simple—if the market is sliding to its second \nlowest low, it is almost certain to continue falling and hit the key low, where the bulk \nof stops cluster. Using Nic’s stop, I get out with a smaller loss and lower slippage than \nwould occur when the markets drop to more visible lows.\nThe same logic works when shorting—place your Nic’s stop not “a tick above the \nhighest high” but at the level of the second highest high. Let’s review some recent \nexamples of both longs and shorts in Figure 54.1.\nYou may want to explore several different systems for placing stops, such as Para-\nbolic, SafeZone, and Volatility stops, described in the books mentioned above. You \ncan get fancy or you can stay plain, but keep in mind the most important principles: \nfirst, use stops; and second, don’t place them at obvious levels, easily visible to any-\none looking at that chart. Make your stops a little tighter or wider than average—\nstay away from the crowd because you don’t want to be an average trader.\nFor the same reason, avoid placing stops at round numbers. If you buy at $80, \ndon’t place a stop at $78 but at $77.94. If you enter a day-trade at $25.60, don’t \nplace a stop at $25.25—move it to $25.22 or even $22.19. Round numbers attract \ncrowds—put your stop a little farther away. Let the crowd take the first hit, and \nperhaps your own stop will remain untouched.\nAnother method, popularized by Kerry Lovvorn, is to use Average True Range \n(ATR) stops (see Chapter 24 for the explanation of the ATR). When you enter \nduring a price bar, place your stop at least one ATR away from the extreme of that \nbar. A two ATR stop is even safer. You can use it as a trailing stop, moving it at every \nbar. The principle is the same—place your stop outside the zone of market noise. \n(Figure 54.2)\nOne of the advantages of using trailing stops is that they gradually reduce the \namount of money at risk. Earlier we discussed the concept of “available risk” (Chap-\nter 51). As a trade followed by a trailing stop moves in your favor, it gradually frees \nup available risk, allowing you to make new trades.\nEven if you don’t use SafeZone or ATR stops, be sure to place stops at some dis-\ntance from recent prices. You don’t want to be like one of those fearful traders who \njam their stops so close to current prices that the slightest meaningless fluctuation is \ncertain to hit them.\n",

You will use a splash of noisy behavior to get a good entry into a trend-\nfollowing trade.\nDon’t Let a Winning Trade Turn into a Loss\nNever let an open trade that shows a decent paper profit turn into a loss! Before you \nput on a trade, start planning at what level you’ll begin protecting your profits. For \nexample, if your profit target for that trade is about $1,000, you may decide that a \nprofit of $300 will need to be protected. Once your open profit rises to $300, you’ll \nmove your protective stop to a breakeven level. I call that move “cuffing the trade.”\nSoon after moving your stop to breakeven, you’ll need to focus on protecting \na portion of your growing paper profit. Decide in advance what percentage you’ll \nprotect.\nFor example, you may decide that once the breakeven stop is in place, you’ll pro-\ntect a third of your open profit. If the open profit on the trade described above rises \nto $600, you’ll move up your stop, so that the $200 profit is protected.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFIGURE 54.2  S&P 500 and a 20-day New High–New Low Index.

You may choose different percentages, depending \non your level of confidence in a trade and risk tolerance.\nAs a trade moves in your favor, your remaining potential gain begins to shrink, \nwhile your risk—the distance to the stop—keeps increasing. To trade is to manage \nrisk. As the reward-to-risk ratio for your winning trades slowly deteriorates, you \nneed to begin reducing your risk. Protecting a portion of your paper profits will \nkeep your reward-to-risk ratio on a more even keel.\nMove Your Stop Only in the Direction of Your Trade\nYou buy a stock and, being a disciplined trader, put a stop underneath. That stock \nrises, generating nice paper profits, but then it stalls. Next, it sinks a little, then a \nbit more, and then goes negative, inching towards your stop. As you study the chart, \nits bottom formation looks good, with a bullish divergence capable of supporting a \nstrong rally. What will you do next?\nFirst of all, learn from your mistake of not having moved up your stop. That stop \nshould have been raised to breakeven a while ago. Failing that, your options have nar-\nrowed: take a small loss right away and be ready to reposition later—or continue to \nhold. Trouble is you feel tempted to go for the third and utterly unplanned choice—\nto lower your stop, giving your losing trade “more room.”\nDon’t do it!\nGiving a trade “more room” is wishful thinking, pure and simple. It doesn’t belong \nin the toolkit of a serious trader.\nGiving “more room” to a losing trade is like telling your kid you’ll take away his \ncar keys if he misbehaves, but then not following through. That’s how you teach him \nthat rules don’t matter and encourage even worse behavior. Standing firm brings \nbetter long-term results.\nThe logical thing to do when a trade starts acting badly is to accept a small loss. \nContinue to monitor that stock and be ready to buy it again if it bottoms out. Persis-\ntence pays, commissions are cheap, and professional traders often take several quick \nstabs at a trade before it starts running in their favor.\nCatastrophic Stops: A Professional’s Life Jacket\nSoon after moving to a house near a lake I bought a kayak, and immediately went \nshopping for a life jacket. All I had to do to be legal was to have a jacket in the \nkayak—any cheap piece of junk would suffice. Still, I spent good money on a quality \njacket that felt snug and didn’t interfere with rowing when I wore it.\nAll I planned to do with that kayak was to paddle peacefully on a lake, not any-\nwhere near white water or currents. I never expected to actually need that jacket. \nDid I waste my money buying it? Well, if ever some motor boat clips me, then wear-\ning a high-quality jacket can make the difference between life and death.\nIt’s the same with stops. They’re a nuisance and often cost you money.

IS THIS AN A-TRADE?\t\n225\nKeep in mind that a bad accident is much more likely in the market than on a lake. \nThat’s why it’s essential to use stops.\nA “hard stop” is an order you give to your broker. A “soft stop” is an order you \nkeep in your head, ready to place it when needed. Beginners and intermediate trad-\ners must use hard stops. A professional trader, sitting in front of a live screen all day, \nmay use a soft stop if he has the discipline to exit when his system tells him to do it.\nStill, accidents happen. A professional trader friend described how he fought \nagainst a market reversal. His soft stop was set at a $2,000 loss level, but by the time \nhe threw in the towel and got out, his loss grew to $40,000—the worst of his trading \ncareer. This is why, even if you don’t use hard stops on a regular basis, you should at \nthe very least use a “catastrophic stop” for every trade.\nFor any A-trade, whether long or short, draw a line on your chart where you ab-\nsolutely do not expect that stock to go. Place your hard stop at that level and make \nit GTC: “good ’til cancelled.”  That will be your catastrophic stop. Now you can play \nwith the luxury of soft stops. Paddle your kayak hard, knowing that you’re wearing \na reliable life jacket.\nHad my friend whose $2,000 drawdown metastasized into a $40,000 loss used a \nhard “catastrophic” stop, he would have taken only a relatively small loss, sidestepped \na disaster, and avoided the financial and psychological hurt of a shark bite.\nStops and Overnight Gaps: Only for the Pros\nWhat will you do if your stock gets hit by a major piece of bad news after the market \ncloses for the day? Looking at pre-opening quotes the next morning, you realize that \nit’ll open sharply lower, deep below your stop, promising massive slippage.\nThis is a rare occurrence, but it does happen.\nIf you’re a new or intermediate trader, there isn’t much you can do—just grit \nyour teeth and take your loss. Only coldly disciplined pros have an additional \noption: day-trade your way out of that stock. Pull your stop, and after the stock begins \ntrading, handle it as if it was a day-trade you bought at the first tick of that morning.\nOpening gaps are often followed by bounces, giving nimble traders an opportunity \nto get out at a smaller loss. This doesn’t always happen—which is why most traders \nshould never use this technique. You may actually deepen your loss instead of reducing it.\nBe sure to get out before the close. Your damaged stock may bounce today, but \ntomorrow more sellers are likely to come in and drive it lower. Don’t let a bounce \nlull you into a false hope of a reversal.\n■\n■55. Is This an A-Trade?\nYour performance in any field will improve if you take tests. Getting graded on them \nwill help you recognize your strengths and weaknesses. Now you can work on rein-\nforcing what’s good and correcting what’s not.\nWhenever you complete a trade, the market gives you three grades. It grades the \nquality of your entry and exit, and most importantly, it delivers your overall trade grade.\n",

Your buy grade is based on the location of your entry, \nrelative to the high and low of the daily bar during which you bought.\n(high–buy point)\n(high–low)\nBuy grade =\nThe closer to the bar’s low and the farther away from the bar’s high you buy, the \nbetter your buy grade. Suppose the high of the day was $20, the low $19, and you man-\naged to buy at $19.25. Entering those numbers into the formula gives you a buy grade \nof 75%. If your buy grade is 100%, it means you bought at the bottom tick of the day. \nThat’s brilliant, but don’t count on it happening. If your buy grade is 0%, it means you \nbought the top tick of the day. This is terrible and should serve as a reminder not to \nchase runaway prices. I calculate my buy grade for every trade and consider anything \nabove 50% a very good result, meaning I bought in the lower half of the daily bar.\nThe following is the formula for your sell grade\n(sell point–low)\n(high–low)\nSell grade =\nThe closer to the bar’s high and the farther away from the low of the bar you sell, \nthe better your sell grade. Suppose the high of the day was $20, the low $19, and \nyou managed to sell at $19.70. Entering those numbers into the formula gives you a \nsell grade of 70%. If your sell grade is 100%, it means you sold at the top tick of the \nday. If your sell grade is 0%, it means you sold at the bottom tick of the day. This ter-\nrible grade should serve as a reminder to sell earlier instead of panicking. I calculate \nmy sell grade for every trade and consider anything above 50% a very good result, \nmeaning I sold in the upper half of the daily bar.\nWhen evaluating any trade, most people assume that the amount of money they \nmake or lose in that trade reflects its quality. Money is important for plotting the \nequity curve, but it’s a poor measure of a single trade. It makes more sense to rate \nthe quality of every trade by comparing what you’ve got to what was realistically \navailable. I find my trade grade by comparing points gained or lost in a trade to the \nheight of the daily chart’s channel measured on the day of the entry.\n(sell–buy)\n(channel high–channel low)\nTrade grade =\nA well-drawn channel contains between 90% and 95% of prices for the past 100 \nbars (see Chapter 22). You may use any number of channels—parallel to the EMA, \nAutoenvelope, Keltner, or ATR channels—as long as you’re being consistent. A chan-\nnel contains normal price moves, with only the extreme highs and lows protruding \noutside it. The distance between the upper and the lower channel lines on the day you \nenter a trade represents a realistic maximum of what’s available to a swing trader in \nthat market. Shooting for a maximum, though, is a very dangerous game. I consider \nany trade that gains 30% or more of its channel height an A-trade.1 (Figure 55.1)\n1 This term comes from the U.S. school grading system: A is excellent, B good, C mediocre, and D poor.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Impulse system with MACD-\nHistogram 12-26-9. (Chart by Stockcharts.com)\nBuy, Sell, and Trade Grades\nThis chart comes from my diary of a trade in Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK) while working on this \nbook (you saw my plan for this trade in Figure 38.1). I was piggybacking one of the Spike \npicks, and my strategy here was “pullback to value.” ADSK had recently staged a deeper \nthan average pullback—notice a false downside breakout marked by a red arrow, followed \nby a successful retest, marked with a green arrow.\nDay A—Feb. 10, 2014, Monday: high $52.49, low $51.75, upper channel line $53.87, \nlower $47.61 (we’ll need channel values to calculate the trade grade on exit). Bought \nat $51.77. Buy grade = (52.49 − 51.77) / (52.49 − 51.75) = 97%.\nDays B and C—Tuesday and Wednesday): rally continues, start moving up stop.\nDay D—Thursday: high $54.49, low $53.39. Sold at $53.78. Sell grade = (53.78 − 53.39) / \n(54.49 − 53.39) = 35%. Trade grade = (sell − buy) divided by channel height = \n(53.78 – 51.77) / (53.87 − 47.61) = 32%.\nMy buy grade in this trade was unusually high, the sell grade below average, but the \noverall trade grade was very good. Busy with the book, I traded only 200 shares, so my \nprofit, after commissions, was less than $400. Had I graded my trades by profits, this one \nwould be easy to overlook, but catching 32% of channel earned me an A.\n",

The results came quickly: as the number of non- \nA-trades sharply declined, my equity curve began to rise at a steeper angle.\nYou need to have a clear idea of what would be a perfect setup for you, \n“an A-trade.” Perfect doesn’t guarantee profits—there are no guarantees in the \nmarket—but it means a setup with a strong positive expectation. It also means \nsomething you’ve traded before with which you are comfortable. Once you know \nwhat it is, you can start looking for stocks that exhibit that pattern.\nOne of the few advantages of a private trader over an institutional one is that we \ncan trade or not trade when we like. We have the luxury of being free to wait for \nexcellent setups. Unfortunately, most of us, in our eagerness to trade, throw away \nthis amazing advantage.\nI’ve added the question “Is this an A-trade?” to my Tradebill, a trade management \nform we’ll discuss in the next chapter. Whenever I see a potential trade, I ask myself \nthis question. If the answer is “yes,” I start calculating risk management, position siz-\ning, and planning my entry. If the answer is “no,” I turn the page and go looking for \nanother pick. (Figure 55.2)\nNo matter how grand an idea or a stock tip, I will not trade it unless it fits into one \nof my three strategies. Ideas come and go, fly or flop—but strategies stay and grow \nbetter with age, as you learn how they perform under various market conditions.\nGradually, you may develop new strategies and drop others. You can see that the \nones I use are numbered 1, 4, and 7. The rest of the numbers were strategies I \nstopped using.\nYour system can be very mechanical or quite general, with just a few key prin-\nciples, like my Triple Screen. Either way, you must know what your “A-trade” looks \nlike before you plan your next trade.\nFIGURE 55.2  The Strategy box in the Trade Journal. (Source: SpikeTrade.com)\nWhenever you plan a trade, be sure to specify what system you’ll use. Ask yourself wheth-\ner this planned trade looks like an “A-trade” according to your system.\nI use the words “system” and “strategy” interchangeably—both mean a trade plan. As \nyou can see from this snapshot of my trade journal’s Strategy box, taken in September \n2013, I currently trade three systems. My main one is a “false breakout with a divergence.” \nI also occasionally trade pullbacks to value—buying pullbacks during uptrends and short-\ning rallies in downtrends. On rare occasions, I trade against the extremes, buying severely \nbeaten down stocks or shorting stocks whose wild rallies are stalling.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

The way we trade is as personal as handwriting. Define a strate-\ngy that feels comfortable to you, test it, and then find a chart that perfectly represents \nit. Print that chart and post it on a wall near your trading desk. Now you can search \nfor trades that look the way that chart looked on the day you entered that trade.\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 55.3  SLB daily with 13- and 26-day EMAs and a 6% envelope. Impulse system with MACD- \nHistogram 12-26-9. (Chart by Stockcharts.com)\nFalse Downside Breakout with a Bullish Divergence\nThis chart, from my Trade Journal, shows a near-perfect example of a swing trade strategy \nthat I abbreviate as “01 FB + BD”—a false breakout with a bullish or bearish divergence. \nSchlumberger, Ltd. (SLB) was in a well-established downtrend, and when it reached a new \nlow at A, it looked like just another bottom during a long and painful slide. I look at the entire \ncircled area of MACD-Histogram as a single bottom because it never crossed above the zero \nline. In area B, the picture became more interesting: MACD-Histogram rallied above its center-\nline, “breaking the back of the bear.” The weekly Impulse system (not shown), which had been \nred until then, turned blue, removing its prohibition of buying. In area C, SLB cracked to a \nnew low, but MACD declined to a much more shallow low, setting up for a bullish divergence.\nLook carefully at the first blue bar after several red bars in area C. That’s where MACD-\nHistogram ticked up, completing a bullish divergence. In addition, that bar rallied and \nclosed above the downside breakout level, marked by a purple dashed line: it marked \nprevious bars as a false downside breakout.\nI bought during that bar (marked by a vertical green arrow), without waiting for it to \nclose, going long 2,000 shares at $60.80, with a stop at $59.12. Four days later, as prices \nbegan approaching the upper channel line as well as the level of the previous top I started \ntaking profits. I sold 1,000 shares at $66.55 and the rest on the following day at $67 (both \nmarked by red arrows). I booked nearly $6 per share, for a total of $11,950 before commis-\nsions in five trading days. The system delivered a beautiful trade.\nThis is the chart I have in mind when looking for stocks and futures to trade. I want to \nfind those that have completed their bottom A and top B and are declining into what could \nbecome bottom C. In the background, the Impulse system on the weekly chart cannot be \nred because that would prohibit buying.\n",

Every trade has several param-\neters, and it’s easy to overlook some of them in the heat of action. Just as a pilot goes \nthrough a preflight checklist, a trader needs to check his list before deciding to place \nan order.\n■\n■56. Scanning for Possible Trades\nThere are thousands of stocks out there, and in the days and weeks ahead, some \nwill rise, others fall, and some will fluctuate. Each stock will make money for trad-\ners whose systems are in gear with it—and lose money for the rest. Developing a \ntrading system or a strategy must come before scanning. If you don’t have a clearly \ndefined strategy, what will you scan for?!\nBegin by developing a system that you trust. Once you have it, looking for trad-\ning candidates will become quite logical and straightforward. Looking at your list \nof candidates, the first question about any pick will be “Is this an A-trade?” In other \nwords, is this pick close to your ideal pattern? If the answer is “yes,” you may start \nworking up a trade.\nScanning means reviewing a group of trading vehicles and zooming in on trading \ncandidates. Your scanning can be visual or computerized: you may flip through mul-\ntiple charts, taking a quick glance at each, or else have your computer run through \nthat list and flag stocks whose patterns appeal to you. To repeat, defining a pattern \nyou trust must be your first step, scanning a more distant second.\nBe sure to have realistic expectations for scanning. No scan can find you the needle \nin a haystack—the one and only gem to trade. What a good scan does is bring up a \ngroup of candidates on which to focus your attention. You can make that group big-\nger or smaller by loosening or tightening scan parameters. A scan is a time saver that \ndelivers potential candidates; it is not a piece a magic to free you from the necessity \nof working up your picks.\nBegin by describing what stocks you want to find. For example, if you’re a trend-\nfollower, but don’t like chasing stocks, you may design a scan to find stocks whose \nmoving average is rising but the latest price is only a small percentage above that \naverage. You can write a scan yourself or hire someone to do it for you—there are \nprogrammers who offer this service.\nThe raw list of stocks to be scanned can be as small as a few dozen or as large as \nthe S&P 500, or even Russell 2,000. I like looking for trading candidates on week-\nends, and depending on how much time I have, take one of the two approaches—one \nlazy and the other hardworking. The lazy way, when my time is limited, is to review \nSpikers’ picks for the week ahead. Spikers are the elite members of SpikeTrade.com, \nand I figure that among a dozen picks by super-smart traders who compete for the \nbest pick of the week there ought to be a stock or two for me to piggyback. I examine \nthose picks, while adding my market opinion to the mix. Depending on my outlook \nfor the week ahead, I focus primarily on long or short candidates.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

SCANNING FOR POSSIBLE TRADES\t\n231\nThe hard-working way consists of dropping all 500 components of the S&P 500 \ninto my software and running a scan for potential MACD divergences. I’ve seen \nmany divergence scans, but never a reliable one—they all delivered too many false \npositives and missed many good divergences. Then I realized that a divergence was \n“an analog pattern”—clearly visible to a naked eye but hard to pick with digital pro-\ncessing. I turned to John Bruns, who built me a semiautomatic MACD divergence \nscanner. Instead of looking for divergences, it scans for patterns that precede diver-\ngences and delivers the list of candidates to watch in the days ahead. (Figure 56.1)\nRunning my MACD divergence semiautomatic scan over the weekly and daily \ncharts of all 500 components of the S&P 500 takes only a minute, but the real work \nbegins when I review the lists of bullish and bearish candidates delivered by this scan. \nFirst, I compare the sizes of bullish and bearish lists. For example, for several weeks \nprior to writing this chapter, my scan for bullish divergences among the components \nof the S&P 500 produced four to five candidates, while the scan for potential bearish \ndivergences returned between 70 and 80 stocks. This great imbalance indicated that \nA\nB\nA\nB\nA\nB\nA\nB\nFIGURE 56.1  WFM daily with 13- and 26-day EMAs. Impulse system with MACD-Histogram 12-26-9. \nRed dots—potential or actual bearish divergences. Green dots—potential or actual bullish divergences.  \n(Chart by TradeStation, scanner by John Bruns/elder.com)\nMACD-Histogram Semiautomatic Divergence Scanner\nWe’ve reviewed MACD Histogram and its divergences in Chapter 23 and returned to this \npattern repeatedly throughout this book. Instead of looking for completed divergences, \nthis semiautomatic scan finds stocks that have completed parts A and B of a potential \ndivergence. As part C (the second top or bottom) begins to emerge, this scan starts putting \nred dots above or green dots below the bar to alert one to the possibility of a divergence.\nThis chart of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) shows that a scanner isn’t an automatic \ntrade finder. It is a watchdog that alerts you to the possibility that this market is ready \nto trade—long or short. Having received such a signal, a trader needs to work up that stock \nto establish the level at which the divergence would be completed and write down entry, \ntarget, and stop levels.\n",

I prune my weekly list of trading candidates down to five or six \npicks that show the most attractive patterns and the best reward to risk ratios. These \nare the stocks that I’ll aim to trade during the week. I have friends who can juggle \ntwenty stocks at once—this can be done, but not by me, and every serious trader \nmust know his limitations.\nAnother “hardworking way” of finding trade candidates involves scanning stock in-\ndustry groups. For example, if I think that gold is approaching an important bottom, \nI’ll pull up the list of all 52 gold stocks and 14 silver stocks that are listed at this time \nand look for buying candidates. While doing that, I’ll keep in mind my SLB chart \nshown in Figure 55.3—I want to find stocks whose patterns look close to my ideal.\nIf you’re going to scan a large number of stocks, it pays to add some negative \nrules. For example, you may want to omit stocks whose average daily volume is be-\nlow half a million or even a million shares. Their charts tend to be more ragged and \ntheir slippage worse than in more actively traded stocks. You may want to exclude \nexpensive stocks from your scans for buying candidates and cheap stocks from your \nscans for shorting candidates. Choosing at what levels to place your price filters is a \nmatter of personal choice. This is why scanning is best left for experienced traders. \nLearn to fish with just a few lines in the water before casting a broad net.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Mellon in Unstuff  Your Life.\nThe market is perversely inconsistent in dishing out rewards and punishments. \nThere is always a chance that a poorly planned trade may bring profits, while a well-\nplanned and carefully executed trade may end in a loss. This random reinforcement \nsubverts our discipline and encourages sloppy trading.\nGood record-keeping is the best tool for developing and maintaining discipline. It \nties together psychology, market analysis, and risk management. Whenever I teach a \nclass, I say: “Show me a trader with good records, and I’ll show you a good trader.”\nWriting down your trade plans will ensure that you don’t miss any essential mar-\nket factors.

As your account grows, you’ll experience a wonderful \nfeeling of accomplishment.\nLet’s review the three key components of record-keeping:\n1.\tDiscipline begins with doing your homework (I’ll offer you a homework spread-\nsheet).\n2.\tDiscipline is reinforced by writing down your trade plans (I’ll offer you PDF files \nfor working up long and short candidates).\n3.\tDiscipline culminates in executing those plans and completing trade records (I’ll \noffer you a link to an online Trade Journal).\nPlease feel free to personalize all of these documents. The markets are huge and \ndiverse, and there is no “one size fits all” system of analysis, trading, and record-\nkeeping. The basic principles are in this book, but the way you implement them can \nbe your own.\n■\n■57. Your Daily Homework\nWhen you wake up in the morning and know that you need to be at the office in an \nhour, you don’t spend time planning every little step. You follow an established rou-\ntine: get out of bed, wash, get dressed, have breakfast, get in a car, etc. This routine \nputs you in the groove for the day ahead, leaving your mind free for strategic think-\ning. By the time you arrive at the office, you’re ready to face the day.\nIt pays to have a morning routine for the market: a sequence of steps for touching \nbase with the key factors that may dominate today’s trading. This routine should \nput you in gear with the market before the opening bell, making you alert and \nready to act.\nI use a spreadsheet for my pre-open routine. The person who gave me this idea \nwas Max Larsen, a money manager in Ohio. I’ve changed Max’s spreadsheet: my cur-\nrent version is numbered 3.7, reflecting two major revisions and a handful of lesser \nones. It is based on how I view the markets, while its imbedded links help me reach \nvarious websites for the information I want.\nMy homework spreadsheet (Figure 57.1) is a work in progress, as I keep adding \nand deleting lines. If you start using it, I’m sure that you’ll modify it to suit your pref-\nerences. My firm, Elder.com, offers my latest spreadsheet, complete with its psycho-\nlogical self-test as a public service—simply write to info@elder.com and ask for it.\nAfter filling out this spreadsheet, I turn to my open trades. I review their stops \nand profit targets, making any adjustments for the coming day if necessary. Then, if \nI’m planning to trade today, I review my short list of candidates, focusing on planned \nentries, targets, and stops. Now I am in gear with the market, ready to place orders. \nI do this homework even if I know that I will not be able to trade during the day, for \nexample when traveling. This discipline is just like washing and dressing in the morn-\ning, even on the days when you don’t plan to go to the office.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Your mood, health, and time pressures influence your ability to trade. \nFor example, imagine trading while suffering from a toothache. You can’t fully con-\ncentrate on the market and should be calling your dentist, not your broker.\nThis is why each morning, I take a 30-second psychological self-test for an ob-\njective rating of my readiness to trade. The first person I saw use a self-test was \nBob Bleczinski, a former Spiker. He may have posted his test online because in 2011, \nI saw SpikeTrade member Erin Bruce present her self-test at that year’s reunion. The \nquestions she asked herself were completely different, but the format looked like \nBob’s.\nI modified Erin’s self-test to fit my personality and take it every day before the \nmarket opens. Any self-test must be short and specific. Mine has only five questions, \nand each of them can have only one of three answers: yes, no, or so-so. We’ll discuss \nthe logic of designing such tests in the following chapter. If you start using this test, \n  9.\t Bonds—Rising or falling interest rates are among major drivers of stock market trends.\n10.\t Baltic Dry Index—A sensitive leading indicator of world economy. BDI represents the \ncost of shipping dry goods, for example textiles from Vietnam to Europe or lumber \nfrom Alaska to Japan. BDI is very volatile, and the absence of any trading vehicles \nbased on it helps BDI reflect true economic activity. It is extra useful if you trade \nshipping industry stocks.\n11.\t NH-NL—I consider the New High–New Low Index the best leading indicator of the \nstock market and like to write down the latest weekly and daily figures every morning \nas a refresher.\n12.\t VIX—The volatility index, also called “the fear index.” There is a saying: “When VIX is \nhigh, it’s safe to buy; when VIX is low, go slow.” A footnote: beware VIX ETFs, notori-\nous for trading out of sync with the VIX index.\n13.\t S&P 500—I write down yesterday’s closing price for the index and add the Impulse \nsystem initials for its weekly and daily charts.\n14.\t Daily value—I switch to the daily chart of the S&P and note whether its latest bar \nclosed above, at, or below value and also its relation to the channel lines. It helps me \nsee whether the market is overbought or oversold.\n15.\t Force Index—I note whether its 13-day EMA is above or below its centerline (bullish \nor bearish), as well as any divergences.\n16.\t Expectation of the S&P candle—I test the accuracy of my market expectations by \nwriting down whether I expect the market to close above or below today’s opening \nprice. If no opinion, I leave this field blank. The next day I color this box green or red, \ndepending on whether my expectations turned out to be correct.\n17.\t On the last line of my homework spreadsheet, I summarize it by stating how I’ll trade \ntoday: actively, conservatively, defensively (closing trades only), day-trade, or no \ntrades at all.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

It must prompt you to \ncheck the dates of earnings and dividends or contract rollovers, in order to save you \nfrom being blindsided by predictable news. It must spell out your planned entry, \ntarget, and stop as well as your trade size.\nWriting down a trade plan makes it real. Once you enter a trade and your equity \nstarts fluctuating, you may feel stressed and forget to perform certain tasks. The plan \nyou write prior to entering a trade becomes your island of sanity and stability in the \nmiddle of a storm; it helps ensure that you don’t overlook anything essential.\nA really good plan will include a scale for measuring its quality. This objective \nrating, which we’ll discuss below, takes less than a minute, but it encourages you to \nimplement only those plans that have a higher likelihood of success. It prompts you \nto drop marginal plans and not chase borderline trade ideas.\nWhile all my records are in electronic format, I like having my trade plans on \npaper. I use preprinted forms that I named Tradebills, similar to waybills that come \nwith the packages we order online. When a company sends you a product, it comes \nwith a waybill that shows the name of the product, its quantity, your address, the \nmode of delivery, rules for returns, and other essential facts. My trades are accom-\npanied by tradebills from the planning stage to the closing day.\nI have two separate tradebills for each trading system, one for buying and another \nfor shorting. Here we’ll review a tradebill for one of my favorite strategies. You can \nuse it as a starting point for developing your own tradebill.\nWhenever a potential trade catches my eye, I decide which system it fits and then \npick up the appropriate blank tradebill. Right there, if a seemingly attractive trade \nfits no trading system, then there is no trade. Having decided on a system, I write \ndown the date and the ticker symbol, and then score that potential trade, as shown \nbelow. If the score is high enough, I proceed to complete my trade plan; otherwise, \nI toss that sheet of paper into a wastebasket and go looking for other trades.\nWherever I go, I carry my tradebills for open trades. If I’m at my desk, they are \nnext to my keyboard. If I go out during the day and bring my laptop, I put those \ntradebills between the keyboard and the screen, so they’ll be the first thing to see \nwhen I open up my laptop.\nHaving written down my trade plans for years, I gradually developed a method for \nscoring them before making a go/no-go decision. My habit of scoring plans was re-\ninforced when I read Thinking, Fast and Slow by Prof. Daniel Kahneman. This book on \ndecision making by a behavioral economist and a Nobel Prize winner underscored \nthe value of simple scoring systems—they make our decisions more rational and less \nimpulsive.\nScoring Your Trade Plans (a Trade Apgar)\nAmong the examples in Prof. Kahneman’s book was his description of the work of \nDr. Virginia Apgar (1909–1974), a pediatric anesthesiologist at Columbia University. \nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Doctors and nurses worldwide use \nthe Apgar scale for deciding which newborns require immediate medical care.\nMost babies are born normal; some have complications, while others are at risk \nof dying. Prior to Dr. Apgar, doctors and nurses used clinical judgment to tell those \ngroups apart, and their mistakes contributed to infant mortality. Dr. Apgar’s scoring \nsystem made their decisions objective.\nThe Apgar score summarizes answers to five simple questions. Each newborn is \nrated on its pulse, breathing, muscle tone, response to a pinch, and skin color. A good \nresponse to any question earns two points, poor zero, or one for an in-between. The \ntest is generally done at one and five minutes after birth. Total scores of seven and \nabove are considered normal, 4 to 6 fairly low, and less than 4 critically low. Babies \nwith a good score are safe to put into general care, while those with low Apgar scores \nrequire immediate medical attention. The entire decision-making process, focusing \non whom to treat aggressively, is quick and objective. Dr. Apgar’s simple scoring \nsystem has improved infant survival rates around the world.\nAfter reading Prof. Kahneman’s book, I renamed my scoring system the “trade \nApgar.” It helps me decide which of my trade ideas are strong and healthy or sickly \nand weak. Of course, as a trader, my actions are completely opposite to those of a \npediatrician. A doctor focuses on the sickest kids, to help them survive. As a trader, \nI focus on the healthiest ideas and trash the rest.\nBefore I show you my Trade Apgar, a word of caution: the scoring method you’re \nabout to see is designed for one system—my “false breakout with a divergence” \nstrategy. All other systems will require a different test. Use my Trade Apgar as a \nstarting point for developing a test for your own system.\nFor example, I recently gave the file of my Trade Apgar to a professional option \nwriter who consulted with me. He loved the idea of a written test, which reduced im-\npulsivity, one of his key problems. Within a few weeks, he showed me his own Trade \nApgar, which greatly differed from mine. He replaced one of my indicators with his \nfavorite RSI and Stochastic and added questions directly relevant only to option writ-\ning. I was happy to see that he was trading more profitably.\nA Trade Apgar demands clear answers to five questions that go the heart of a trad-\ning strategy. As you develop a Trade Apgar for your own strategy, I suggest keeping \nthe number of questions down to five and rating your answers on a zero/one/two \npoint scale. Simplicity makes this test more objective, practical, and quick.\nWhile looking at a potential trade, I take a blank tradebill from a stack and circle \nmy answers to its five questions. A circle in the red column earns a zero, in the yellow \ncolumn one point, and in the green column two points. I write down each number \nin the score box and add up the five lines. Also, if I circle the red column, I may write \nin the box next to it at what price the answer will change to a more favorable yellow \nor green. That will raise the plan’s score, allowing me to enter a trade at that level. \nFigure 58.1 shows a Trade Apgar for going long; Figure 58.2 shows a Trade Apgar \nfor shorting. \nIt takes less than a minute to generate a Trade Apgar for any stock.

Very rarely both time- \nframes are perfect—it is fine for one to be perfect and for the other to be merely \ngood.  If neither timeframe looks perfect, it can’t be an A trade—drop this stock and \nmove on to another one.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

You can look it up at several free websites, \nsuch as www.Briefing.com, www.earnings.com, or www.Finviz.com. Most traders avoid \nholding stocks whose earnings are about to be reported. A nasty earnings surprise can \ndo serious damage to your position. Writing down that date forces you to focus on \navoiding trouble.\n■\n■\nThe next box is the dividend date, if any. I usually look it up at http://finance.yahoo.com. \nDividends create tax consequences for longs, while shorts have to pay dividends, so \nthey definitely want to avoid holding on that day.\n■\n■\nThe last box is for the date of my plan.\nPart 2: Trade Apgar\n■\n■\nMy Trade Apgar was described above. Remember that each strategy demands its own \nApgar. You’re perfectly welcome to replace my questions with those that are relevant to \nyour own system. For example, you may ask whether Stochastic is in the overbought \nzone (zero), oversold (one), or oversold with a bullish divergence (two).\n■\n■\nAfter you sum up the numbers for the Trade Apgar, answer this key question in writing: \nIs this an A-trade? If the total score is below 7, drop this stock and look for another trade.\nPart 3: Market, entry, target, stop, and risk control\n■\n■\nThe five boxes along the left edge require me to answer questions about the general \nstate of the market. Is the Spike Bounce signal in effect? Is the indicator that traces \nstocks above their MAs bullish or bearish? What is the short interest in this stock and \nhow many days to cover? All of these studies have been described in this book. The last \nbox is for a few words of a summary.\n■\n■\nThree boxes linked by arrows are at the heart of my decision-making process. They \ndemand three essential numbers for every trade: the entry, the target, and the stop.\n■\n■\nDollar risk—How many dollars are you willing to risk on this trade? This number can \nnever exceed two percent of your account equity. I usually keep it considerably below \nthat threshold.\n■\n■\nSize—How many shares or futures contracts will you buy, based on the permitted dollar \nrisk and the distance from the entry to the stop. This is explained in detail in “The Iron \nTriangle of risk control” in Chapter 50.\nPart 4: After the entry\n■\n■\nThe A target is 30% of the daily channel height added to the entry price.\n■\n■\nThe soft stop is what you may keep in mind, while the hard or catastrophic stop is the \nactual order. It may not be any lower than the stop listed in Section 3.\n■\n■\nPut in the price level at which you’ll move your stop to breakeven.\n■\n■\nCheck the boxes on the right as you perform these essential steps: place a stop, create \na diary entry, and place a profit-taking order.\nGet More Forex Books + Secrets at http://forexfinest.com\n",

Trade Journal\nMemory is the cornerstone of civilized life. It allows us to learn from our success-\nes and even more from our failures. Keeping a diary of your trades will help you \ngrow and become a better trader.\nKeeping detailed trade records feels burdensome—but that’s what serious trad-\ners do. Many people asked me after I published a book of interviews with traders \n(Entries & Exits, 2006), what all of them had in common. They lived in different coun-\ntries, traded different markets, and used different methods—but all kept excellent \nrecords.\nThe best example came from the woman whose interview was in the first \nchapter of that book. While finishing the manuscript, I realized that our inter-\nview had been incomplete and I needed to ask additional questions about her \ntrades. A year later, on another visit to California where she lived, I asked to \nmeet again. I assumed she’d show me some recent trades, but she went to a filing \ncabinet and pulled out a folder with all her trades for the week of my previous visit. \nWe completed our interview by reviewing her charts from a year ago as if those \ntrades were made yesterday. A bull market was in full swing, she was doing great, \nbut still worked to improve her performance. Her detailed diary was her self- \nimprovement tool.\nLet your diary entries serve as your “extra-cranial memory,” a tool for building \nthe structure of success.\nFor years, I struggled with developing a record-keeping system that would be \neasy to update and analyze. In the beginning, I kept the diary of my trades in a paper \njournal, gluing in chart printouts and marking them up—I still keep one of those an-\ntiques next to my trading desk. Later I kept my diary in Word, and then in Outlook. \nFinally, in 2012, Kerry Lovvorn and I created a web-based Trade Journal1.\nThis Trade Journal is a joy to keep, and both Kerry and I use it for all our trade \ndiaries. Our Trade Journal is available to all, and its use is free (up to a limit). The jour-\nnals are online, password protected, and absolutely private—although SpikeTrade \nmembers have an option of sharing their trade journals for selected trades.\nPart 5: The copyright line\n■\n■\nThis line shows when this tradebill was updated.

The trades you entered and exited at the hard right edge of the chart are \nnow in the middle of that chart, where you can re-examine your decisions and learn \nhow to improve them.\nThree Benefits\nKeeping a trade journal delivers three major benefits. One is immediate—a greater \nsense of order. The second comes a month or two later, when you start reviewing \nyour closed trades. Finally, after you accumulate dozens of records, you’ll have sev-\neral ways to analyze them and learn from your equity curves.\nA Sense of Order and Structure comes from documenting the plan, the entry, \nand the exit for each trade. Where exactly will you enter, what is your target, where \nwill you place your stop? Defining and writing down those numbers will steer you \ntowards disciplined trading. You’ll become less likely to slip into an impulsive buy, \noverstay a profitable trade, or let a loss snowball without a stop. Filling out risk \nmanagement numbers will give you a handle on trade sizing. Documenting exits will \nmake you face your trade grades.\nA perfect\ntrade in good\nsize\nFIGURE 59.2  DISCA daily with 13- and 26-day EMAs and a 6% channel.

Trading signals that may have appeared vague and uncertain \nat the right edge of a chart become crystal clear when you view them in the middle \nof your screen. Returning to your past trades and adding an “after the trade” chart \nmakes you reevaluate your decisions. Now you can clearly see what you did right or \nwrong. Your journal will be teaching you priceless lessons.\nI make my strategic decisions on the weekly charts, tactical on the dailies. Since \nmy daily charts are formatted to show five to six months of data, once a month I \nspend a few hours reviewing trades that I closed two months ago. For example, at \nthe end of March or in the beginning of April, I’ll review all trades that I closed out \nin January. I’ll pull up their current charts, mark my entries and exits with arrows, \nand write a comment on every trade. Let me share two examples with you (Figures \n59.2 and 59.3). \nSuch reviews teach you what’s right with your trading, and what needs to be \nchanged. Soon after I started doing my “two months later” reviews, I became aware of \ntwo problems with my exits. I noticed that my stops were a bit tight and that helped \nme figure out that by slightly increasing the amount of risk, I could substantially re-\nduce the number of whipsaws and come out ahead.

(MCP) was “pullback to value”—I thought that a new \nuptrend had begun. The following day, I was no longer so sure and sold for a small profit. \nA review two months later showed that I missed the resumption of the bear trend; my deci-\nsion to cut and run with a small profit was correct, but I overlooked a major trade.

If your equity curve is in a downtrend, your system may be at \nfault, or your risk management poor, or your discipline lacking—whatever it is, you \nmust track it down and solve that problem.\nStill, a combined equity curve for all your trades and accounts is a pretty crude \ntool. The Trade Journal allows you to zoom in and trace your equity curves for spe-\ncific markets, strategies, and exit tactics. For example, I can run separate equity \ncurves for longs and shorts, for different strategies and exits, and even for sources of \nmy trade ideas.

We have worked through the essential trading topics: psychology, \ntactics, risk management, and record-keeping. Still, becoming a successful trader \nwill take more than reading a single book.\nHow long do you think it might take?\nYou may have seen this huge number—10,000.  According to some authors, that’s \nthe number of hours it takes to become an expert in major pursuits, such as profes-\nsions or sports. If that is true and you spend 40 hours per week, 50 weeks a year, it’ll \ntake five years to become a pro. If you can invest only 20 hours per week, it’ll take \nten years. That’s a scary thought.\nIf you, like so many people, came to trading after a successful career in another \nfield, be it engineering, farming, or business, you may well have invested that many \nhours in it. Do you really want to spend another 10,000 hours on a new project at \nthis stage of your life?\nBefore you shudder at this prospect, let me share a very different number with \nyou—20 hours. It comes from a book, The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything...\nFast! Its author, Josh Kaufman, makes a sensible point that while becoming a world-\nclass expert will take years, you can achieve a basic level of competence in most \nfields in a much shorter time.\n“The early hours of practicing something new are always the most frustrating. \nThat’s why it’s difficult to learn how to speak a new language, play an instrument, hit \na golf ball, or shoot great photos. It’s so much easier to watch TV or surf the web...” \nhe writes. To learn a new skill, you need to find the experts and get their materials, \n",

Kaufman describes how he \ntook 20 hours to learn several new skills, including windsurfing and programming \na website. Even if you take up a more complex activity, such as flying, 20 hours \nwill get you through the ground school and the first few lessons with an instructor. \nThis won’t make you a pilot, but 50 hours of flight time should earn you a private \npilot’s license.\nThe number of hours for mastering basic trading skills is even higher, but much \ncloser to flying than to 10,000 hours.\nThe intellectual demands of trading aren’t high. After all, we deal with only five \nnumbers—open, high, low, and closing prices, plus volume. The main difficulty \ncomes from our emotions. Trading stirs up powerful feelings, the strongest of which \nare greed and fear.\nNew traders focus on money, dream about what their profits will buy, and throw \ncaution to the wind. They buy as many shares as they can afford and double up on \nmargin. Filled with joyful anticipation, they write down no trade plans. When a trade \nturns against them, their emotions swing from greed to fear. That’s when they freeze, \nwhile the market grinds down their accounts.\nTechnically, trading isn’t very hard. Psychologically, it’s the hardest game on \nthe planet.\nTo reduce the stress of trading, keep in mind several essential points. Your trading \nlife depends on following these rules:\n■\n■Trade small sizes while learning.\n■\n■Do not count money while in a trade.\n■\n■Use risk management rules, primarily the 2% Rule.\n■\n■Write down your plans, especially these three numbers: entry, stop, and target.\n■\n■Keep a trading diary and review it at least once a month.\nMost traders are terribly isolated and never get to see how others practice their \ncraft. This isolation contributes to impulsive trading. A private trader who violates \nevery rule in the book and makes gross errors remains invisible to others. Nobody \nwill warn him to stay out of trouble or praise him for a good trade.\nIn the old days, our brokers knew what we were doing, but now we place orders \nonline. The only human who may contact you about your trades is the margin clerk \nat a brokerage firm. Getting a call or an e-mail from him is never good news. I hope \nthat you never meet a margin call, sending good money after bad.\nTo break out of your isolation, to see what good traders are doing, and to be \nrewarded for your performance, I suggest you look into SpikeTrade.com—a website \nI run with my friend Kerry Lovvorn.

Then, if we do a good job, we may be able to build \nupon what we learned, advance a few steps, and share our knowledge with those \nwho may follow us.\nThis book is dedicated to Lou Taylor, probably the most remarkable person I met \nin my life. He was a brilliant, fearless, and a completely “out of the envelope” man, \nthe amazing story of whose life (he died in 2000) deserves its own book.\nThe New Trading for a Living reflects how I think, feel, and act in the markets. I am \ntempted to thank by name all those who helped me become who I am today, and per-\nhaps kick at a few who would have loved to see me fail. If I give in to this temptation \nit’ll become an autobiography instead of a brief acknowledgment. So let me mention \nonly those who directly and substantially helped me during the past 18 months while \nI was working on this book.\nKerry Lovvorn began as my student but became a partner and a friend. While my \nbackground is in psychiatry, his is in steel. As he became more attuned to psychologi-\ncal issues, I became more structured and data oriented. It’s a great partnership, and \nrunning SpikeTrade together is today at the center of my intellectual life.\nJeff Parker, an old friend, carefully read and critiqued this book as well as its Study \nGuide—a tough but friendly critic. Chip Anderson of StockCharts.com not only \nhelped me master his software but converted my personal charts into the format \nsuitable for the book. My agent Ted Bonanno took care of business, while Nancy \nDimitry and Gabriella Kadar of D&P Editorial Services did a yeoman’s job of con-\nverting my files into a physical book. It was a pleasure working with John Wiley & \nSons again, and I greatly appreciate what Paul diNovo, their creative director, did for \nAcknowledgments\n\t\n257\n",
