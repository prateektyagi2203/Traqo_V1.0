# VOLUME ANALYSIS RULES (from Anna Coulling)
# ============================================================

VOLUME_RULES = [
    "Once you have seen it for real, you will understand why volume is so powerful in supporting price, and why I believe the exponents of PAT are simply promulgating something different for the sake of it.",
    "Equally in the future, if the market reverses to test this region, once again we can say with confidence that there is a strong platform of support, which will take some extreme volumes to penetrate and break.",
    "Once this second pivot high has formed we are then expecting the market to pullback, but hopefully only in a minor way at this stage, and on low volume, at which point we are now looking for our second pivot low.",
    "Whilst the second phase of congestion is, as we would expect, with below average volume bars in a short phase of sideways price action, the next level above, our third level, is already starting to ring the alarm bells.",
    "Furthermore, if the shooting star is accompanied by low volume, and the market had been in sideways congestion for a period following the selling climax, this also confirms the insiders testing demand as the market moves away from the distribution phase.",
    "On this chart, we are looking at an eighteen month period approximately, and we can see that the pair has topped out and rolled over into a nice price waterfall, all confirmed with nicely rising selling volumes, validating the move lower.",
    "It takes effort for the market to rise and also takes effort for the market to fall, so if there has been a large change in price in the session, then we expect to see this validated by a well above average volume bar.",
    "As you would expect the volume at price profiles have now changed, as we are seeing heavy volumes coming into the market, as evidenced on both the VAP and also on our traditional volume bars at the bottom of the chart.",
    "At this stage, do not be surprised to see the market pull back to test the ceiling as it moves higher, but this should be accompanied with low or falling volume, since we are now developing a bullish trend higher and expect to see a rising market with rising volume, if this is a true move higher.",
    "In turn this will also be validated by considering the associated volume and price action on slower time frames along with analysing potential support and resistance areas ahead, which might create pause points in any longer term trend, Therefore, the first step is always the price action, immedi...",
    "Fig 10.10 Honeywell (HON) Daily Chart The stock sells off, moving lower, and initial weakness is signalled by the small shooting star candle, which is then confirmed with rising volume and a wide spread down candle.",
    "If you remember back to the previous chapter, I referred to support and resistance as invisible barriers, natural barriers if you like – well now, with volume at price, these barriers are actually revealed on our charts.",

    "For example, if this price action had appeared on a one hour chart, and on checking the 15 minute chart, we could see two shooting star candles had formed in that time frame, both with above average volume, this gives confirmation that any reversal may be more significant.",
    "Whilst each of these plays a part in defining the price action within the time frame under consideration, it is the wicks and the spread which are the most revealing in terms of market sentiment, when validated with volume.",
    "However, the key thing about the second congestion phase is that the volumes, relatively speaking, are lower, and therefore this price region may not offer the same degree of support in the event of a reversal lower.",
    "In the futures markets, it gives you the ultimate weapon to validate price, and to reveal the true market sentiment of buyers and sellers and to take action as the reversals in trend are signalled using volume.",

    "The response is muted with the up candle, which moves higher on low volume, not a sign of strength, but is followed on the next candle with rising volume and a wide spread candle, so an encouraging signal.",
    "However, let's take a look at an individual bar in more detail, and the four elements which create it, namely the open, the high, the low and the close, and the importance of these from a Volume Price Analysis perspective.",
    "Examples Of Validation Fig 4.10 Wide Spread Candle, High Volume In the example in Fig 4.10 of a wide spread up candle with small wicks to top and bottom, the associated volume is well above average, so the volume is validating the price action.",
    "Whilst the second phase of congestion is, as we would expect, with below average volume bars in a short phase of sideways price action, the next level above, our third level, is already starting to ring the alarm bells.",
    "It takes effort for the market to rise and also takes effort for the market to fall, so if there has been a large change in price in the session, then we expect to see this validated by a well above average volume bar.",
    "As you would expect the volume at price profiles have now changed, as we are seeing heavy volumes coming into the market, as evidenced on both the VAP and also on our traditional volume bars at the bottom of the chart.",
    "Fig 4.14 Multiple Bar Validation In Up Trend In the first example in Fig 4.14 we have a bullish trend developing in a rising market, and what is obvious is that rising prices are accompanied by rising volume.",
    "The market has been rising steadily on rising volume, when at some point in the bullish trend, the market sells off sharply, with the price moving lower in the session, only to recover and close at, or near the high of the session, creating the familiar 'hammer candle price action'.",
    "Fig 10.10 Honeywell (HON) Daily Chart The stock sells off, moving lower, and initial weakness is signalled by the small shooting star candle, which is then confirmed with rising volume and a wide spread down candle.",
    "If you remember back to the previous chapter, I referred to support and resistance as invisible barriers, natural barriers if you like – well now, with volume at price, these barriers are actually revealed on our charts.",
    "As we can see from the chart, starting at the far left the SLV had been moving sideways, albeit with a bullish tone before starting to fall, breaking below the interim platform of support with 5 consecutive down candles, on rising volume.",

    "Fig 10.16 AUD/USD - 15 Min Spot Forex Chart We are now paying attention as with this volume bar, the pair should have risen strongly, and clearly in the volume bar there is a large amount of selling, confirmed by the deep wick to the top of the candle.",
    "I've already mentioned Volume Price Analysis or VPA several times so far, which is the relationship between volume and price over the entire life of the candle, but what happens within the life of the candle for example.",
    "The third law which states we have increased the result (price spread is wider than before) which should be matched by increased effort (volume should be higher than on the previous candle) – and so it is.",
    "I would sit with my live feed and my two monitors, one for the cash market and the other for the equivalent futures market, watching every price bar and the associated volume and using my knowledge to interpret future market behaviour.",

VOLUME_ANOMALY_RULES = [
    "And once again, as with all volume analysis it is in comparing one with another that the anomalies are revealed giving us the validation we are always searching for in any analysis of price using volume, and in this respect VAP is no different.",
    "At this point we would be moving to our traditional Volume Price Analysis to look for anomalies and validation, which may well confirm this view, and suggest that any break out is likely to be to the down side.",
    "You are comparing and analysing price behaviour against the associated volume, looking for confirmations or anomalies, whilst at the same time, comparing volume to judge its strength or weakness in the context of volume history.",
    "Whilst I like the concept of showing the price and volume together on one ‘box’ which instantly reveals whether we have a high/low combination, anomalies, or an average/average combination which may be normal, the issue I have is the removal of time.",
    "Whilst it is undoubtedly true to say that price action encapsulates all the news, views and decisions from traders and investors around the world, and that with detailed analysis we can arrive at a conclusion of future market direction, without volume we have no way of validating that price analy...",
    "Second, the falling volume is confirming that we have an anomaly on the trend, as we expect to see rising volume with a rising trend, whereas here we have falling volumes on a rising trend.",
    "The SLV then drifts sideways for a few bars before we see two narrow spread down candles, the first with above average volume, an anomaly, and the second with extremely high volume.",
    "The currency pair had been rising nicely for a little while, volumes were average (as marked with the dotted white line) with no anomalies or signs of weakness at this stage.",
    "The pair manage to move higher for a couple of bars, but the warning has been flagged and sure enough five bars later we see a shooting star candle with high volume.",
    "As I'm sure you will recall from the introduction to Volume Price Analysis, all we are looking for, on any candle or sequence of candles, is validation or anomaly.",
    "In other words, the volume has been low, but the price action has been wide, so this might be equivalent to a wide spread up candle on low volume, so an anomaly.",
    "The process can be broken down into three simple steps: Step 1 – Micro Analyse each price candle as it arrives, and look for validation or anomaly using volume.",
    "Once again as we can see in Fig 6.13 I have shown the candle with three volume bars beneath, and the one which is an anomaly is the first one on low volume.",
    "However, towards the end of this phase we start to see daily selling pressure absorbed with a narrow spread down candle and high volume, again an anomaly.",
    "Is the volume validating the price action and what signal is this sending to us, or is it an anomaly, and therefore sending us a very different signal.",

    "While this may sound complicated, it all boils down to learning to believe that: (1) you don't need to know what's going to happen next to make money; (2) anything can happen; and (3) every moment is unique, meaning every edge and outcome is truly a unique experience.",
    "A prerequisite for thinking in probabilities is that you accept the risk, because if you don't, you will not want to face the possibilities that you haven't accepted, if and when they do present themselves.",
    "Not knowing this, most traders start their careers with a fundamental lack of understanding of what it means to be a trader, the skills that are involved, and the depth to which those skills need to be developed.",
    "They don't attempt to pick and choose the edges they think, assume, or believe are going to work and act on those; nor do they avoid the edges that for whatever reason they think, assume, or believe aren't going to work.",
    "The good news is that, ultimately, the exercise I present in Chapter 11 will install the five fundamental truths and resolve many of the potential conflicts, but only if you know exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it.",
    "If you believe that something will happen and that you don't need to know exactly what that something is to make money, then where s the potential to define and interpret market information as threatening and painful?",
    "CHAP TER 8 CHAPTER 8 WORKING WITH YOUR BELIEFS Now the task before you is to properly integrate the five fundamental truths presented in Chapter 7 in your mental environment at a functional level.",
    "Creating consistency requires that you completely accept that trading isn't about hoping, wondering, or gathering evidence one way or the other to determine if the next trade is going to work.",
    "ALIGNING YOUR MENTAL ENVIRONMENT Now we're going to start zeroing in on exactly how you can align your mental environment in order to accept the risk and function like a professional trader.",
    "How truthful a belief is (relative to the environmental conditions) can be determined by how well it serves us; that is, the degree to which it helps us satisfy our objectives.",
    "Typical traders go through the exercise of convincing themselves that they're right before they get into a trade, because the alternative (being wrong) is simply unacceptable.",
    "I have spent the last seventeen years dissecting the psychological dynamics behind trading so that I could develop effective methods for teaching the principles of success.",
    "This same process causes us to believe that we 'know' exactly what to expect from die market, when the reality is there are always unknown forces operating at every moment.",
    "Now, if you take these experiences and put them into the context of what we now understand about the nature of beliefs, there are a number of observations we can make: 1.",
    "In fact, if you have to try, it's an indication that you haven't completely integrated the principles of consistent success as dominant, unconflicted beliefs.",
    "However, when it comes to avoiding emotional pain and the negative consequences it creates, especially for traders, very few people understand the dynamics.",
    "Learning to truly accept the risks in any endeavor can be difficult, but it is extremely difficult for traders, especially considering what's at stake.",
    "There is a huge psychological gap between assuming you are a risk-taker because you put on trades and fully accepting the risks inherent in each trade.",
    "This is by far the most essential as well as the most difficult principle for people to grasp and to effectively integrate into their mental systems.",
